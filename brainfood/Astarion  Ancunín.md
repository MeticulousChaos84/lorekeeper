### D&D Character Worksheet

*A loose guide to help you think about your D&D character and make them awesome. Feel free to answer all the questions that interest you, ignore all the ones that don’t.*

* What is your character’s name? Any nicknames, titles, aliases?

* What is your race and class? How do those affect you?

* What do you look like? Age, size, gender expression, etc. Give some specific things you wear or distinguish you. Do you look abnormal from others of your race/class?

* What do you sound like? (You need not be a master voice actor, but your character should be distinguishable from you.)

* What is someone’s first impression of you? How about the second? Or hundredth? Do you face discrimination?

### BACKGROUND 

* Where are you from? Name your hometown/area yourself or ask your DM for ideas.

* What family were you born with? Make up some names. Who did you grow up with? Where are they now?

* What family did you make? Friends? Caretakers? Organizations?

* How did you become an expert in your class? (And where’d you get all those proficiencies?) Mentor? School? Innate ability? A blood-soaked grimoire you forgot to return to the library?

* Who is someone you could go to for help? What is their position? Why would they assist you?

* What was the most defining event of your life so far?

* What did you do before our story begins? Did you have a job? Home life? Other adventures?

### GOALS/PERSONALITY

* What are your greatest strengths/weaknesses? Any outlier ability scores? Any vices?

* What is your fatal flaw? Hubris? Greed? Rashly filling out worksheets?

* What do you want more than anything else in the world? Money? Power? Daddy’s approval?

* What is your greatest goal or ambition? Why do you need to complete this goal? (In real life, sometimes we have goals that are misguided or even impossible!)

* Who do you care about more than anyone else in the world? Your kids? Yourself? That cute boy in your potions class you never got up the guts to talk to?

* Do you have a deity or patron? What is your relationship with religion? How about with your deity? (Ask your DM for suggestions of existing deities/patrons if you prefer.)

* Describe your view of the world in plain terms. Are people good? Are the gods just? Are hotdogs sandwiches?

* What’s a motto you live by? Or die by? Or just a lyric that gets stuck in your head?

* What are three adjectives that describe you?

* Do you have any personality quirks that others notice?

* How do you work in a team? (Be aware that even if you’re Satan, you need to be motivated to be with the party.)
