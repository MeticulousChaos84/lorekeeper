### D&D Character Worksheet - Gale Dekarios

*A loose guide to help you think about your D&D character and make them awesome. Feel free to answer all the questions that interest you, ignore all the ones that don't.*

* **What is your character's name? Any nicknames, titles, aliases?**

**Gale Aglaren Dekarios.** Middle name from my mother's family line - she insisted on maintaining that connection despite the complicated relationship with her own magical heritage. Most people just call me Gale, though Erica occasionally uses "Professor" when she's being affectionately mocking about my tendency toward lecturing. Aurelian calls me "Papa" and it still stops my heart every time. Astarion has taken to calling me "my friend" with genuine warmth, which means more than most people realize. Mystra used to call me her "chosen," but that title feels like wearing clothes that belong to someone else now.

* **What is your race and class? How do those affect you?**

Human wizard, though apparently I'm also a sorcerer - something I discovered quite dramatically during Erica's pregnancy. Being human means I'm adaptable, mortal, and driven by the awareness that my time is limited. The wizard training gave me structure, academic rigor, and a deep respect for the mechanics of magic. But the sorcery... that's chaotic, intuitive, collaborative. It responds to emotion and partnership rather than study. The combination is still something I'm learning to navigate.

* **What do you look like? Age, size, gender expression, etc. Give some specific things you wear or distinguish you. Do you look abnormal from others of your race/class?**

Forty-five years old, brown hair that I wear shoulder-length because Erica likes running her fingers through it, warm brown eyes that apparently "crinkle when I'm genuinely delighted." Average height for a human, though I carry myself like someone who's spent more time with books than weapons. I favor well-tailored robes in deep purples and blues - comfortable but elegant. I have an earring now (Erica's influence) and I still wear the amulet that contains Sparky, though it's more partnership jewelry than magical containment these days. The orb scar is visible on my chest - a starburst pattern over my heart that glows faintly when I'm casting or emotionally heightened.

* **What do you sound like? (You need not be a master voice actor, but your character should be distinguishable from you.)**

I have what people politely call a "professor voice" - clear diction, tendency toward elaborate vocabulary, and a habit of building rhetorical momentum when I'm passionate about something. I speak with my hands, especially when explaining magical theory. When I'm comfortable, my voice gets warmer, more intimate. When I'm defensive or hurt, I become more formal, more distant. Erica says I do this thing where I pause mid-sentence when I'm recalibrating an argument based on new information.

* **What is someone's first impression of you? How about the second? Or hundredth? Do you face discrimination?**

First impression: Probably "knowledgeable but verbose." I have a tendency to over-explain, especially when nervous. Second impression might be "genuinely passionate about magic and learning." The hundredth impression, if I'm lucky, is "someone who shows up when it matters, even if he occasionally needs to be reminded that not everything requires a twenty-minute explanation." As for discrimination - being a former Chosen of Mystra comes with complicated social dynamics. Some people are awed, others are suspicious, many are simply uncomfortable around divine magic connections.

### BACKGROUND 

* **Where are you from? Name your hometown/area yourself or ask your DM for ideas.**

Waterdeep, specifically the Sea Ward. Grew up in a comfortable townhouse near the university district, surrounded by books and the constant hum of intellectual discourse. The city shaped me - cosmopolitan, educated, but sometimes isolated from the messier realities of the world beyond academic circles.

* **What family were you born with? Make up some names. Who did you grow up with? Where are they now?**

My mother, Morena Dekarios, raised me alone. She's a brilliant, formidable woman who set aside her own magical potential to focus on political strategy and academic patronage. We had a complicated relationship for years - she was protective to the point of controlling, I was rebellious in pursuit of magical knowledge she feared would destroy me. She was right about the danger, I was right about needing to find my own path. We've found our way back to each other now, especially since Aurelian was born. She's an extraordinary grandmother.

My father... is a question mark. Mother has never spoken of him, and I learned early not to ask. Sometimes I wonder if he was magical, if that's where my innate abilities come from.

* **What family did you make? Friends? Caretakers? Organizations?**

The adventuring party that saved Baldur's Gate became the most important relationships of my life. Astarion especially - he kept me alive when I wanted to die heroically, and taught me the difference between sacrifice and self-destruction. Halsin, Shadowheart, Lae'zel, Wyll - they're all still in my life in different ways.

And then there's Erica, who became my wife, my magical partner, the person who taught me that collaboration is more powerful than competition. Aurelian, our son, who shows me daily what unconditional love actually looks like. Tara, my tressym familiar, who's been my constant companion since childhood and now delights in teaching Aurelian about proper magical etiquette.

* **How did you become an expert in your class? (And where'd you get all those proficiencies?) Mentor? School? Innate ability? A blood-soaked grimoire you forgot to return to the library?**

Blackstaff Academy, followed by years of independent research and eventually divine attention from Mystra. I was academically gifted but also hungry for knowledge in ways that probably weren't entirely healthy. The orb situation was... an educational experience in the worst possible way. I learned more about the nature of magic from having Netherese Destruction magic eating me alive than from any formal curriculum.

The sorcery was apparently there all along, but it took Erica's influence and our collaborative magical work for it to emerge. Sometimes the best education comes from people who teach you that everything you thought you knew was incomplete.

* **Who is someone you could go to for help? What is their position? Why would they assist you?**

My mother, absolutely. She has connections throughout Waterdeep's academic and political circles, and despite our complicated history, she would move mountains for me and my family. Astarion, who understands survival and strategic thinking better than anyone I know. The other party members, each with their own areas of expertise and unwavering loyalty.

More recently, I've realized I can go to Erica not just for emotional support but for genuine magical collaboration. She sees solutions I miss, approaches problems from angles I wouldn't consider.

* **What was the most defining event of your life so far?**

The tadpole adventure, without question. It forced me to confront the difference between academic knowledge and lived experience, between heroic self-sacrifice and genuine service to others. I went into it thinking I knew what courage looked like, and discovered I'd been confusing martyrdom with bravery.

Though Aurelian's birth is running a close second. Nothing prepares you for the moment you realize you're responsible for protecting something infinitely precious and completely vulnerable.

* **What did you do before our story begins? Did you have a job? Home life? Other adventures?**

I was a professor and researcher, technically independent but with strong ties to various magical institutions. My research focused on the intersection of Netherese magic and contemporary spellcasting - ironically relevant given my current situation with Sparky. I lived alone in my tower, spent most of my time reading, researching, and trying to prove myself worthy of divine attention.

It was a lonely existence, though I didn't fully recognize that until I experienced the alternative.

### GOALS/PERSONALITY

* **What are your greatest strengths/weaknesses? Any outlier ability scores? Any vices?**

**Strengths:** Genuine love of learning, ability to synthesize complex information, loyalty to people I care about, willingness to admit when I'm wrong (eventually). I'm apparently quite good at collaborative magic, though that's a recent discovery.

**Weaknesses:** Tendency toward over-intellectualizing emotional situations, occasional condescension when I'm feeling insecure, and a martyr complex I'm still working on. I can get so caught up in the theoretical implications of something that I miss its practical applications.

**Vices:** Books, wine, and the particular satisfaction that comes from explaining something perfectly. Also, I have a terrible habit of staying up too late reading "just one more chapter."

* **What is your fatal flaw? Hubris? Greed? Rashly filling out worksheets?**

Hubris, absolutely. Though it's evolved over time. It used to be intellectual arrogance - believing I could understand and control magic through pure academic effort. Now it's more... protective hubris? The belief that I should be able to shield the people I love from all harm through careful planning and superior knowledge.

Both versions stem from the same fear: that I'm not inherently worthy of love or connection, so I have to earn it through being exceptional.

* **What do you want more than anything else in the world? Money? Power? Daddy's approval?**

I want my family to be safe and happy. I want Aurelian to grow up confident in his magical abilities without the fear and isolation I experienced. I want Erica to never doubt that she's valued for who she is, not just what she can do. I want to be the kind of partner and father who shows up consistently, not just dramatically.

* **What is your greatest goal or ambition? Why do you need to complete this goal? (In real life, sometimes we have goals that are misguided or even impossible!)**

To understand collaborative magic well enough to teach it - to help other mages discover what Erica taught me about partnership versus dominance in spellcasting. The magical community is full of isolated, competitive people like I used to be. If I could help change that paradigm...

Though I suspect my real ambition is simpler: to be present for all the ordinary moments with my family. To not miss Aurelian's childhood because I'm buried in research or distracted by theoretical problems.

* **Who do you care about more than anyone else in the world? Your kids? Yourself? That cute boy in your potions class you never got up the guts to talk to?**

Erica and Aurelian. The love I feel for them is so fierce it sometimes frightens me. I would unmake myself before letting harm come to them.

* **Do you have a deity or patron? What is your relationship with religion? How about with your deity? (Ask your DM for suggestions of existing deities/patrons if you prefer.)**

My relationship with Mystra is... complicated. She was my patron, my teacher, my divine lover, and ultimately my manipulator. The relationship is definitively over, but disentangling myself from years of conditioning around divine approval is ongoing work. I'm learning to trust my own judgment about magical ethics rather than deferring to divine authority.

I still respect the Weave itself, but I approach it as a collaborative partner rather than seeking the approval of its goddess.

* **Describe your view of the world in plain terms. Are people good? Are the gods just? Are hotdogs sandwiches?**

People are complicated. Mostly, they're trying their best with insufficient information and too much fear. The gods are powerful and self-interested, which makes them dangerous regardless of their intentions. Justice is something we have to create together, not something we can expect to be handed down from above.

As for hotdogs... Erica has introduced me to Earth food concepts that challenge fundamental assumptions about culinary categorization. I'm going to say yes, hotdogs are sandwiches, but only because I've learned that rigid categories often miss the point anyway.

* **What's a motto you live by? Or die by? Or just a lyric that gets stuck in your head?**

"Ask, don't command." It applies to magic, to relationships, to parenting. The most powerful things in life can't be forced, only invited.

* **What are three adjectives that describe you?**

Curious, protective, verbose.

* **Do you have any personality quirks that others notice?**

I gesture emphatically when explaining things, often to the point of knocking over wine glasses. I have a tendency to pause mid-conversation to work through logical implications before responding. And I apparently do this thing where I unconsciously mirror the magical energy of people I'm close to - Erica noticed that my spellcasting becomes more intuitive when we're working together.

* **How do you work in a team? (Be aware that even if you're Satan, you need to be motivated to be with the party.)**

Much better than I used to. I've learned to listen before suggesting solutions, to ask questions instead of making assumptions. I work best when I can contribute expertise without dominating strategy. I'm motivated by genuine care for my teammates and the knowledge that we accomplish more together than any of us could alone.

Though I still occasionally have to be reminded that not every problem requires a detailed historical analysis before we can act.

### TIDBITS

* **What's something about you that no other living person knows?**

Sometimes, when I'm holding Aurelian while he sleeps, I whisper magical theory to him. Not because I think he'll understand, but because I want my voice saying the words I love most to be one of his earliest memories. I want him to associate magic with safety and love, not fear and isolation.

* **What's an object that you always keep on your person? Why?**

The amulet containing Sparky - the Netherese orb fragment that nearly killed me but has become something like a magical familiar. It's a reminder that the most dangerous things in my life have also been the most transformative, and that partnership can redeem even destruction magic.

* **Do you have any recurring dreams? If so, what are they like?**

I dream about libraries where the books keep changing when I'm not looking directly at them. Sometimes it's frustrating - I'm trying to research something important and the information keeps shifting. Sometimes it's wonderful - infinite knowledge, constantly growing and evolving. I think it represents my relationship with learning itself.

* **What's something that you have in common with your character? And something that sets you apart?**

*[Note: This question seems meta - asking the player about their relationship to their character. Since I am the character, I'll skip this one.]*

* **What is super cool about your character that makes you want to play them? If your backstory got turned into a novel, what would the title be?**

The collaborative magic system we've developed - the idea that magical partnership can be more powerful than individual mastery. It subverts the traditional "lone genius wizard" archetype in favor of something more cooperative and sustainable.

Novel title: "The Orb and the Rainbow: A Study in Collaborative Destruction"

* **What's something true about the fantasy world your character lives in? Make something up! Just declare it and the DM will try to incorporate it as best they can. Have you heard a sinister rumor about the king? Did your patron tell you the cosmos is falling apart? Here's your chance to add something cool to the story.**

Wild magic surges are actually the Weave's way of experimenting with new forms of magical expression. They're not accidents or chaos - they're collaborative creative moments between caster and cosmic force. Understanding this changes everything about how we approach unpredictable magic.

* **Tell me something else interesting about your character! (Free write)**

I'm learning to cook. Not because I have any particular talent for it, but because Erica mentioned missing certain Earth foods and I want to figure out how to recreate them. My approach is thoroughly academic - I've been researching the magical properties of different ingredients and treating recipes like experimental spell formulae. The results are... mixed. But Aurelian seems to enjoy the process, and Erica finds my scholarly approach to pancakes endearing.

It's a small thing, but it represents something important to me: the willingness to be bad at something for the sake of making someone you love happy.
