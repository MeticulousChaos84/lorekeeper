# Gale - Pure Dialogue Lines for Voice Reference

## Academic/Explanatory Voice

"The Weave is still here, all around us - inside of us too. As long as the goddess lives, magic is a tangible thing for those who know how to touch it."

"I've studied magic for many years, and in as many ways I am still a more than capable wizard."

"You have to remember that the Weave is a living thing, both the embodiment and the extension of Mystra herself."

"I do - because it's through practice that I seek to perfect. To augment."

"It's clear crown and brain are intrinsically connected, and given the pressing urgency of us smiting the latter, understanding the former could make all the difference."

## Vulnerable/Insecure Voice

"It's just that I'm no longer able to perform those feats even arch wizards would marvel at."

"She can give and she can take away. I'm afraid I'm still very much on her naughty list."

"Consider yourself lucky you're not."

"If I cannot remain stable... well, let's hope it doesn't come to that. I'd hate to cut our acquaintance short, shall we say?"

## Romantic/Attracted Voice

"I... I didn't think..."

"I believe you. You never look so beautiful as at the end of a stirring battle, your cheeks flushed, gaze bright, muscles glistening..."

"Perhaps it's just the thrill of our near-undead experience talking. But standing at your side through such darkness and disrepair, it only makes me want you more."

"Unfortunately this is neither the time nor place to indulge such feelings. So, we must be patient and push all such thoughts aside. For now."

"Amid the madness that has befallen us, it seems almost out of place to think of a kiss."

"And yet, now more than ever, it's important to recall what makes us human."

## Angry/Hurt Voice

"You used that thing against me? And you saw! After I told you..."

"You had no right! None at all! I've a good mind to turn around and depart this little company of ours immediately."

"I'd rather be alone than spend another moment in the presence of someone inclined to such unjustified invasions of privacy."

"That was... unnecessary."

## Defensive/Deflecting Voice

"Of course, of course. I was just... practising an incantation."

"Not at all. Just some gallows humour for you. I assure you - you were never in any danger. Let me explain."

"Perhaps my reaction was a tad volatile, the irony of which is not lost on me."

"The need remains debatable, but I recognise your responsibility."

## Wistful/Nostalgic Voice

"There it goes. How easily things slip away from us, no matter how hard they were in the obtaining."

"Good night. I enjoyed sharing a moment of magic with you."

"Netherese magic. So pure - so complete - that I didn't even recognise it at first..."

"Netherese magic. So pure - so complete - that I doubted what I was feeling at first."

## Apologetic/Contrite Voice

"I'm sorry, and I assure you - you were never at risk. However, the cause of my condition is... complicated."

"If I've done damage to your opinion of me, then I am truly sorry. But if this crown amounts to what I suspect it is, then your faith will soon be restored, and then some."

## Dismissive/Cold Voice

"I'm going to bed. Perhaps this was all a mistake."

"Why would you even bring this up? Come, let's go. I'm not in the mood for chatter."

"Good night. Yes. Good night." (distracted, distant)

## Hopeful/Grateful Voice

"You have my thanks, though unless we find a treatment soon, you won't have my full strength."

"Nothing a bit of magic can't solve."

"Oh, I was surprised. But pleasantly so, just like I said."
