### D&D Character Worksheet - Erica Dekarios (UPDATED)

*A loose guide to help you think about your D&D character and make them awesome. Feel free to answer all the questions that interest you, ignore all the ones that don't.*

* **What is your character's name? Any nicknames, titles, aliases?**

Erica Jean Dekarios
- Starlight (Gale), Jeanie (my mother), EJ (my brother)
- Archmage of Stubbornness *giggles*

* **What is your race and class? How do those affect you?**

Human, Wild Magic Sorceress? Bard wannabe? Terrestrial Witch and Mystic.

Being human is, well, human. Sometimes I wish that I could survive without sleep like the elves do. Sometimes I wish I had cool glowy eyes like tieflings. I think more than just being human though, maybe I should clarify that I'm from Earth. From a little town that wants to be a big city in the southern united states. That makes me both exotic and backwards simultaneously sometimes when comparing myself to the humans of Faerûn. I sing without inhibition, I can play the clarinet (why don't bards have clarinets?), music is a huge part of my life. Astrology, clairvoyance, empathic and energy magic have always been a part of who I am and they still are - though astrology works different on Faerûn and everyone with a scrying stone or any of a variety of divination spell scrolls can be clairvoyant. The Emotional/Energy/Empath stuff gives me a unique skillset on either side of the portal. 
The sorcery though? That has been the most validating but also most terrifying discovery of my life. And with the wild magic surges linked to my emotional state, I've learned a lot of skills in the past several years to help me regulate my emotions better which has been a definite plus - because sometimes the magical surges are... well, more destructive than turning everyone's skin pink.

* **What do you look like? Age, size, gender expression, etc. Give some specific things you wear or distinguish you. Do you look abnormal from others of your race/class?**

*does math* Ew I'm 44. I'm 5'7''. Curvy enough to be soft and snuggly and endowed with the gift that allows me to utilize both tight sweaters and lowcut necklines as *giggles* enhancements. 
My hair is just past my shoulders, loosely curly with ringlets underneath and sad waves that attempt to curl everywhere else. Naturally, it's brown but prestidigitation doesn't ruin my hair's health the way bleach does and if the people in my life thought I changed my hair color too often *before* I learned I could cast proper magic spells, well... let's just say that my hair often matches my mood, or the holiday, or my outfit, or whatever color Aurelian wants me to make it today. It's usually pulled up in some form of a ponytail, or it's wrapped into a half-assed bun. 
My eyes are grey-blue but they tend to change color? People say that they get greenish or more blue or more grey depending on my mood. 
I wear glasses, I have three piercings in each ear lobe, and in my left ear I have tiny diamond studs pierced in the pattern of the Pisces constellation. 

**CLOTHES** hahaha so 75% of the time I scandalize Faerûn by wearing Earth clothes. My bellbottoms, my doc martens, my converses, hoodies, band-shirts. You name it. For a long time I was worried about drawing attention but I don't care anymore. Most of Waterdeep knows me, whether that's popularity or infamy, I have no idea. Maybe both. 
My wedding ring is a beautiful moonstone with aquamarine accents. Twilight now lives in (Living? Her essence is imprinted in? I don't know now that I think about it) a pendant that matches Gale and Sparky's. 

* **What do you sound like?**

My voice mostly runs in an alto sort of range? It's deeper than what is 'average' for females, unless I'm excited or being... deliberately I don't know what the word is? Like... that sort of fake innocence that, ya know when I mess up and I'm like... "Gaaaaaale" thats when it gets higher pitched. *laughs* 
I SUCK AT WORDS. I'm famous for not remembering what things are called, or people's names, or spell incantations. It's a good thing I'm not a wizard. 
I ramble a lot, stream-of-conscious style, thinking out loud when I'm talking about something, especially if it's something I'm excited about. 
I absolutely have a 'mom voice' when necessary, that involves me getting quiet and very... precise in my annunciation. 

* **What is someone's first impression of you? How about the second? Or hundredth? Do you face discrimination?**

Honestly? First impressions would absolutely be dependent on the situation because I so heavily operate on emotions. In a neutral setting I'm often quiet, observing, I absorb everything around me, cataloging and processing. Unless there's something specific happening emotionally, the first time I meet someone new, I rarely am the one talking. It's the second time that you'll catch more of my personality. By the hundredth time? You've definitely learned my favorite Taylor Swift songs *laughs* and you'll have been witness to those moments where I've verbalized a thought of some kind that probably would have been smarter to have stayed in my head. hahaha. 
Now, if your first impression of me is under some sort of emotional anything? Well, all that normal observation, quiet, slowly building into the chaos magic goof ball that I am is totally off - there are a lot of people in Faerûn who's first impression of me involved a magic surge or some sort of reckless protection and fury. *laughs*

### BACKGROUND 

* **Where are you from?**

Chattanooga, Tennessee. USA. Earth. Not Faerun. *laughs*
I grew up in the quintessential country southern US Bible Belt where everyone knows how to hunt and fish and going swimming involved jumping off rocks into the lake and it's considered fun to go find mud after it rains in someone you know's pick up truck or jeep and do donuts and see just how much you can cover the car in said mud. I say y'all. I eat clover flowers and dandelion greens. I know how to make wine from wild muscadines. *laughs* 
I grew up at the foot of the Appalachian mountains, descended from Scots-Irish and Celtic pagans where I was taught how to navigate the backwoods. Where superstition is real because our gramma's taught us right. Where you side step around circles of mushrooms and then leave cream out in the windowsill, where you put iron nails into door frames, don't let a broom sweep over your feet, you knock on wood to prevent jinxing yourself and you know above all else, the universe has a sense of humor that often comes at your expense. *grins*

* **What family were you born with? Make up some names. Who did you grow up with? Where are they now?**

My mom, my dad, and my younger brother. My dad left when I was 12, my step dad came into my life at 14 and he was one of the greatest men I've ever known. Most of our other family lived far away so it was pretty much just us. David (my step-dad) passed away in 2021 in a freak work accident. My brother is all fancy out in Nashville now as a software developer for Amazon. My mom now lives at my house so that we didn't have to lose it when I moved more or less permanently to Waterdeep. 

* **What family did you make? Friends? Caretakers? Organizations?**

Oh, now that's the good part, isn't it? The found family, the constellation you build instead of the one you're born under. In Faerûn, my circle has grown from happenstance into something like fate stitched with laughter. There's Gale, obviously — husband, mirror, storm-companion, my north star even when the map's upside down. Sparky, the cat familiar who thinks she's a demigod and may be right. Elminster is… complicated. A mentor by proxy, occasionally condescending, occasionally kind, and utterly unbothered by mortal logic. Waterdeep itself has become my caretaker in a way; the city knows my footsteps now. The Blackstaff's apprentices keep an informal tally of how many times I've almost set the harbor district sparkling.
There's also the little constellation of friends I've gathered: Wyll, whose kindness reminds me of bonfire light; Shadowheart, who understands the art of complicated faith; Astarion, who hides tenderness under sharp teeth and wit; and Karlach, who I'd trust with my life and a round of shots.  

* **How did you become an expert in your class? (And where'd you get all those proficiencies?) Mentor? School? Innate ability? A blood-soaked grimoire you forgot to return to the library?**

An expert in which class? I was always really good with biology and chemistry. I excelled in litera-- oh. **CLASS**-class. Sorcery. Right. Well...
"Expert" is a generous term when you're still learning to keep your hair from catching fire during an emotional breakdown, but all right. My wild magic isn't something I studied; it's something I _survived_. When I first crossed to Faerûn, my emotions were a weapon I couldn't aim — grief, joy, and panic all carried arcane consequences. Gale taught me discipline, how to trace the geometry behind the chaos, how to shield my emotions without losing my essence, and how to plan for the collateral damage. Those are all the things that turned me into a spellcaster. But what helped me become an expert? Well - that came from him, too. He taught me how to believe in myself again. 

* **Who is someone you could go to for help? What is their position? Why would they assist you?**

Gale, obviously - my husband, my magical partner, the person who understands both my chaos and my capabilities. Morena, because she's formidable and has connections throughout Waterdeep's power structures, and she's claimed me as family. Karlach, because she'd fight gods for the people she loves and has the heart to match her engine.

* **What was the most defining event of your life so far?**

"A hand? Anyone?" - The moment when my favorite fictional character got stuck in my basement wall and everything impossible became possible. When fictional became real and my whole life pivoted on helping a very confused wizard who was about to explode.

* **What did you do before our story begins? Did you have a job? Home life? Other adventures?**

I was a lab tech, working in medical research, living in my childhood home in Tennessee. My stepfather had just passed away in 2021, I was helping my mom process grief while dealing with my own. I spent my free time reading fantasy novels, playing D&D, practicing witchcraft, and being generally convinced that the best parts of life were fictional. Then fiction crashed into my basement.

### GOALS/PERSONALITY

* **What are your greatest strengths/weaknesses? Any outlier ability scores? Any vices?**

My greatest strength is my heart — too big, too stubborn, too unwilling to give up on anyone. My greatest weakness? Same thing. I'll burn myself down to keep others warm. I'm adaptable, empathetic, creative — but also distractible, overly curious, and allergic to authority in any flavor.

* **What is your fatal flaw? Hubris? Greed? Rashly filling out worksheets?**

Stubborn optimism. The belief that no matter how dark it gets, there's always a way to make it better. That every act of ill-will is a reflection of hurt and trauma. That love really can conquer anything. It sounds noble until you realize it means I don't know when to stop trying to fix what's beyond me. 

* **What do you want more than anything else in the world? Money? Power? Daddy's approval?**

Aurelian to be able to be a kid. Gale to stop being afraid of himself. Mystra to keep her eyes out of our house. For people to remember that the Netherese weren't inherently bad, there was an entire five centuries where they were bright and helpful and kind before they were corrupted by the Ba'etith. I want to meet Taylor Swift.

* **What is your greatest goal or ambition? Why do you need to complete this goal? (In real life, sometimes we have goals that are misguided or even impossible!)**

To be a good mom.

* **Who do you care about more than anyone else in the world? Your kids? Yourself? That cute boy in your potions class you never got up the guts to talk to?**

Obviously Gale and Aurelian. But that feels so *obvious* lol

* **Do you have a deity or patron? What is your relationship with religion? How about with your deity? (Ask your DM for suggestions of existing deities/patrons if you prefer.)**

HA. Unfortunately one follows me around like a lost orphan. I mean that's mostly an exaggeration but - my relationship with religion is so different here. And there are the celtic gods, but they don't exist on Faerun and I'm hardly ever in Tennessee anymore. 

* **Describe your view of the world in plain terms. Are people good? Are the gods just? Are hotdogs sandwiches?**

People are mostly good, gods are mostly bored, and the universe runs on irony. Magic isn't power; it's empathy in motion. A hotdog is only a sandwich if it's in a bun. A slice of ham isn't a sandwich. A spoonful of peanut butter isn't a sandwich. So no. A **hotdog** is just a hotdog. Until it's not.

* **What's a motto you live by? Or die by? Or just a lyric that gets stuck in your head?**

Every new beginning comes from some other beginning's end. // I cry a lot but I am so productive, it's an art. // This is not a moment, it's a movement. // Mistakes don't exist - only learning opportunities.

* **What are three adjectives that describe you?**

Effervescent, curious, unyielding? 
*creative.whismical.compassionate.hopeful.empathic.honest....okayfinei'llstop*

* **Do you have any personality quirks that others notice?**

My entire personality *is* a quirk. lmao.

* **How do you work in a team? (Be aware that even if you're Satan, you need to be motivated to be with the party.)**

Like a glitter bomb in a war council — unpredictably helpful. I adapt, I encourage, I lighten the room. I point out patterns and ask lots of questions. And when it counts, I anchor the chaos with compassion.

### TIDBITS

* **What's something about you that no other living person knows?**

There's nothing about me that no one knows because I'm not ashamed or embarrassed or secretive like, there's nothing that I haven't told at least *someone* I am absolutely an open book.

* **What's an object that you always keep on your person? Why?**

Literally nothing because I'm too scatterbrained to actually not forget even the most important things at least 20% of the time. Ask Gale how many times he's had to, with a smitten grin, put my wedding ring back on my finger because he's found it where I took it off to shower or something. I don't think about things until I do. lol

* **Do you have any recurring dreams? If so, what are they like?**

That one I'm going to have to think about from a character perspective because dreams are - in my experience - symbolic of things and the recurring dreams I have in real life here on Earth don't fit really at all.

* **What is super cool about your character that makes you want to play them? If your backstory got turned into a novel, what would the title be?**

Getting to wake up every morning to a bed I've been alone in most of the night because my husband is Gale Dekarios and he can't turn his brain off anymore than I can turn mine off. I don't know how, at forty-five, he can still function on such little sleep though he was very humanly tired the first 4 months or so of Aurelian's life because holy hells. Having a newborn is exhausting when the newborn isn't a world changing sorcerer whose cries make magic surges happen. Like, I don't know? Everything about me makes me want to do this, it's why I'm doing it. *giggles*

**Novel title:** Wildly Woven

* **What's something true about the fantasy world your character lives in? Make something up! Just declare it and the DM will try to incorporate it as best they can. Have you heard a sinister rumor about the king? Did your patron tell you the cosmos is falling apart? Here's your chance to add something cool to the story.**

Astarion can exist in the sunlight now and Karlach got a heart transplant.

* **Tell me something else interesting about your character! (Free write)**

I excavated a piece of a Mythallar to create a magical battery so that I can enjoy my record player, my hair straightener, and an old film camera (which meant having to set up a dark room) because I refused to not be able to have *snapshots* of the moments that make life worth living. (Though I end up taking the photographs back to Earth, and I turn the best ones into paintings here so that no one asks questions they just think I'm *really* good at remembering expressions and candid moments)
