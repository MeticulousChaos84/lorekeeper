## Key Dialogue Insights

**Gale's Restraint**: Even when angry or at low approval, he doesn't lash out - he becomes formally polite instead.

**Intellectual Defense**: Uses academic language and technical explanations as emotional armor.

**Boundary Setting**: Clear about his limits but explains his reasoning rather than just refusing.

**Self-Knowledge**: Aware of his own curiosity and tendency to be verbose - shows growth/self-reflection.

**Privacy Values**: Consistently prioritizes mental/emotional privacy across all scenes.

These patterns show Gale as someone who uses intellect and formality to manage emotional situations, rather than someone who becomes hostile or crude when upset.
