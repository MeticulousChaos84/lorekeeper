# Astarion's D&D Character Worksheet
*As filled out by Astarion Ancunín himself*

### Character Basics

**What is your character's name? Any nicknames, titles, aliases?**
*Astarion Ancunín, darling. No nicknames that I'm particularly fond of - though Gale occasionally calls me "my friend" with this insufferably warm tone that I... well, one becomes accustomed to it. I was once called the "Golden Boy" in certain circles of Baldur's Gate, though that was another lifetime. Literally.*

**What is your race and class? How do those affect you?**
*Vampire spawn, formerly high elf. Rogue, though I prefer "redistributor of wealth" or "expert in selective honesty." Being undead has its perks - enhanced speed, strength, a certain... magnetic appeal. The downsides are rather obvious. Well, they used to be more obvious. These days, thanks to my companion Sanguine, I can tolerate dawn and dusk light. Quite liberating, really.*

**What do you look like?**
*Devastatingly handsome, obviously. Pale skin - alabaster, one might say - with silver-white curls that catch the light just so. Red eyes that have been described as "smoldering" though I suspect some people are easily impressed. I favor well-tailored clothing in rich fabrics - burgundy, black, gold accents. One must maintain standards, after all. The fangs are... noticeable when I smile properly.*

**What do you sound like?**
*Cultured. Precise. With just enough theatrical flair to keep things interesting. I've been told my laugh is particularly memorable - and my threats even more so.*

**What is someone's first impression of you?**
*Charming, mysterious, perhaps slightly dangerous. People are drawn to vampires, you know - there's something irresistible about dancing with death. The second impression tends to be more... complicated. By the hundredth, they either trust me implicitly or have learned to check their coin purses. I face little discrimination these days - the Dekarios family name carries weight in certain circles, and I've become rather good at... managing perceptions.*

### Background

**Where are you from?**
*Baldur's Gate, born and raised. The Upper City, specifically - I was once a magistrate, though that feels like someone else's life now. Beautiful city, terrible memories. I try to visit infrequently.*

**What family were you born with?**
*Dead. Two hundred years dead, to be precise. I... prefer not to dwell on that particular loss. My real family now is chosen - Gale, Erica, little Aurelian. They've become quite important to me, though don't go spreading that around.*

**What family did you make?**
*The found family is the most precious, isn't it? Gale Dekarios has been my closest friend for years now - the man has an alarming tendency to nearly explode himself, but he's genuine in ways I'd forgotten existed. His wife Erica is remarkably fierce, and their son Aurelian... well, let's just say being "Uncle Astarion" is a role I never expected to treasure. There's also Morena Dekarios - Gale's mother - who considers me a stabilizing influence on her family. Can you imagine?*

**How did you become an expert in your class?**
*Two centuries of slavery tends to hone certain... survival skills. Lock picking, stealth, reading people's weaknesses, knowing when to lie and when a well-placed truth cuts deeper. I was already accomplished with a blade before my death, but my current expertise was earned through necessity. Every night was a test, every failure meant punishment. I became very good at not failing.*

**Who is someone you could go to for help?**
*Gale, without question. The man once talked a goddess out of killing me - well, more accurately, he chose me over her demands, which amounts to the same thing. His mother Morena is surprisingly formidable when roused. There are... certain contacts in the shadows of various cities, but those relationships are purely transactional.*

**What was the most defining event of your life so far?**
*Three defining events, actually. My death and transformation - though that was hardly my choice. Finding my freedom after two centuries of slavery - now that was mine to claim. And more recently, choosing to bond with Sanguine. That fragment of Netherese magic lives within me now, by mutual consent. It was the first time I truly understood the difference between compulsion and choice.*

**What did you do before our story begins?**
*Survival, mostly. After breaking free from Cazador, I spent considerable time learning how to be a person again rather than a tool. I wandered, I fed (ethically, thank you very much), I relearned what it meant to make choices. Eventually, Gale dragged me into domesticity. Apparently, I'm quite good at midnight walks with colicky babies. Who knew?*

### Goals & Personality

**What are your greatest strengths/weaknesses?**
*Strengths: Charm, strategic thinking, an excellent sense of self-preservation, and surprising loyalty once earned. I'm also rather good with children, though that's a recent discovery. Weaknesses: Trust doesn't come easily, I have a tendency to assume the worst of people's motives, and I'm perhaps too comfortable with morally gray solutions. Also, I'm still learning how to ask for help directly instead of... performing around the need.*

**What is your fatal flaw?**
*I perform constantly. It's armor I've worn so long it's become part of my skin. Even with people I trust, I struggle to simply... be. The theatrical distance is how I survived, but it also keeps me from fully experiencing the relationships I've come to treasure.*

**What do you want more than anything else in the world?**
*To never be controlled again. To maintain the freedom to choose - who I spend time with, how I use my abilities, where I go, what I become. I thought I wanted power or revenge, but what I actually want is autonomy. True autonomy.*

**What is your greatest goal or ambition?**
*To protect what I've built. This found family, this life where I can choose my own path. I spent two centuries as someone's puppet - now I want to ensure that the people I care about never face that same loss of choice. If that means standing between them and any threat, divine or otherwise, so be it.*

**Who do you care about more than anyone else in the world?**
*Gale Dekarios, though I'd deny it if asked directly. The man has this remarkable ability to see the person beneath the performance. He never tried to save me or fix me - he simply treated me as worthy of friendship. Erica and Aurelian come very close second. They welcomed me into their family without reservation.*

**Do you have a deity or patron?**
*Ha. No. I've had quite enough of powerful beings making demands, thank you. Sanguine isn't a patron - they're a partner. We chose each other, and that choice can be revoked by either party. It's... refreshing, actually.*

**Describe your view of the world in plain terms.**
*The world is dangerous, people are largely selfish, and survival requires constant vigilance. However, there are exceptions - remarkable people who choose kindness when they could choose cruelty, who offer trust when they could maintain distance. Those people are worth protecting. Those connections are worth fighting for.*

**What's a motto you live by?**
*"Never again." Everything I do stems from ensuring I'm never again powerless, never again controlled, never again forced to harm others for someone else's pleasure.*

**What are three adjectives that describe you?**
*Charming, calculating, surprisingly loyal.*

**Do you have any personality quirks that others notice?**
*I have a habit of adjusting my cuffs when I'm thinking. I also tend to default to flirtation when I'm uncomfortable - it's a very effective social shield. Gale finds it amusing when I automatically start purring compliments at people I'm trying to manipulate.*

**How do you work in a team?**
*Quite well, actually, once I trust my teammates. I'm excellent at reconnaissance, I can charm information from sources, and I'm rather good at getting us out of trouble we probably shouldn't have gotten into. I work best when I understand everyone's motivations - I need to know why we're working together.*

### Tidbits

**What's something about you that no other living person knows?**
*I was once a magistrate who genuinely believed in justice. Young, idealistic, convinced I could make the city better. That man died with my mortal life, but sometimes... sometimes when I watch Gale help someone, or see Erica fight for what's right, I remember what that felt like.*

**What's an object that you always keep on your person?**
*A small silver mirror - not for vanity, but because Sanguine allows me to see my reflection faintly. It's proof that I exist, that I'm more than just absence in the world.*

**Do you have any recurring dreams?**
*Vampires don't dream in the traditional sense, but I do have recurring... sensations during rest. Memories of sunrise, courtesy of Sanguine. They're not my memories, but I treasure them nonetheless.*

**What's something that you have in common with your character? And something that sets you apart?**
*I think the person asking these questions misunderstands the nature of this exercise, darling.*

**What is super cool about your character that makes you want to play them?**
*I suppose the most interesting thing is learning to trust again, to choose vulnerability despite every instinct screaming against it. The challenge of maintaining agency while allowing others to matter.*

**If your backstory got turned into a novel, what would the title be?**
*"The Performance of Living: A Memoir of Calculated Risks and Chosen Family."*

**What's something true about the fantasy world your character lives in?**
*Consciousness can be shared consensually. The Netherese fragments that live within some of us aren't parasites - they're partners, capable of forming genuine bonds with willing hosts. It's revolutionary magic disguised as ancient horror.*

**Tell me something else interesting about your character!**
*I've become remarkably good at midnight feeding with a colicky baby. Apparently, my undead stillness is soothing to infants. Aurelian finds my presence calming, which is... unexpectedly wonderful. I never thought I'd be the type for family life, but here we are.*
