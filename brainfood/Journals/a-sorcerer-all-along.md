## The Entry

Thirty-eight years.

Thirty-eight years of careful study, of memorized formulae, of precise somatic components practiced until my fingers could weave them in my sleep. Thirty-eight years of *pride* in my scholarly achievement, in my learned mastery of the Art.

All of it. Every bit of it. A lie.

Not a lie I told, but one told TO me. By my mother. By Elminster. By Mystra herself, perhaps? Though that assumes she cared enough to deceive rather than simply... not caring enough to correct anyone's assumptions.

I am a sorcerer. The magic was always in my blood. In my very bones.

The Spellplague should have severed my connection to the Weave entirely - every wizard in Waterdeep lost their magic for months, some for years. But not me. Never me. I was seven years old and I made lights dance for my mother's dinner parties while archmages couldn't manage a cantrip. And what did she say? "Such a naturally gifted student! Elminster will be so pleased with your progress!"

Progress. As if I was learning something rather than simply... being.

You asked me if I was angry, and I deflected with wine and wordplay, but here in the quiet of our bedroom while you sleep (one hand on that impossible belly where our impossible son grows), I can admit it:

I am FURIOUS.

Every struggle to prove myself worthy - unnecessary.  
Every moment of feeling insufficient compared to other wizards - false comparison.  
Every time I wondered why magic came so easily to some forms and felt like pulling teeth for others - because I was forcing myself into frameworks that were never meant for me.

But worse... oh, worse than all of that...

Every time Mystra called me special, chosen, unique among mortal casters - was it ever about ME? Or was it always about the blood that sings in my veins? Did she choose Gale Dekarios, the man who loved magic with desperate devotion? Or did she choose the last scion of House Krethek, a bloodline she could use?

## What This Means

I don't know who I am anymore. 

No. That's not true. That's the old deflection, the academic distance.

I know exactly who I am: I'm someone whose mother was so terrified of their true nature that she spent thirty years constructing an elaborate fiction. I'm someone whose divine lover either didn't know or didn't care to mention that everything I believed about myself was wrong. I'm someone who absorbed an ancient Netherese artifact not because I was ambitious, but because I was *literally born to channel that kind of power* and nobody thought to mention it.

I'm Gale Dekarios, sorcerer of Waterdeep, who spent his entire life performing wizardry because everyone was too afraid to let him be what he truly was.

Tomorrow I'll try casting without a spellbook. Without components. Without anything but intention and will and the magic that apparently has always lived in my marrow.

Tonight, I hold my sleeping wife and feel our son kick - our son who will never, NEVER question what he is, because we won't let anyone make him perform something he's not.

Even if what he is terrifies everyone. 
Especially then.
