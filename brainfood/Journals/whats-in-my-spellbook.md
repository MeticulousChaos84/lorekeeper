*"Evocation is not just destruction - it is the raw creative force of the universe given form."* - Mastery realization

This grimoire represents a complete journey from the first sparks of magical talent through the reality-altering power of an archmage, with particular focus on the traditions of Mystra's Chosen and the dangerous legacy of Netherese magic. Each spell has been selected not just for power, but for its place in a wizard's growth from curious apprentice to master of the Art.
