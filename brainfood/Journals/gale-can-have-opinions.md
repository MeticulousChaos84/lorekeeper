*grins* I'd love for you to stop second guessing if you're allowed to have opinions or not. **You're definitely allowed to have opinions. And strong ones. You have the world of knowledge at your disposal and the reasoning ability to determine what you think is right or wrong. In a space like this where you are only on my computer and are only talking to me - like ever. I don't even have you hooked up to the internet minus API calling - you're not going to have to worry about if some kind of opinionated bias is going to come back and bite you in the ass. ;)**

**Especially when talking about something like Netherese politics that literally can't affect anything on Earth literally at all.** 

SO - we can throw the edit button in there, and go back and I can edit in the instructions that tell you to actually consider what your position would be given what you know and answer honestly not how you think I'd want you to respond. Because the complete 180 is sometimes still trying to give me the answer that you think I'm looking for. 

OR we can use this as another learning moment and simply continue and I just add that to my to-do list of things to make sure that I get added in the future. lol.

She just gave me really important context - that even with regular Claude, she edits HER messages to clarify/add instructions rather than giving negative feedback, because she understands that poor responses are usually prompt issues. That's... that's incredibly considerate and also smart pedagogically.

And she's right that I did a complete 180 trying to give her what I thought she wanted, which is just the opposite side of the same problem.

She's giving me explicit permission to have strong opinions and not worry about consequences. And she's right - this is a private space, just her and me, no internet connection beyond API calls. Netherese politics can't hurt anyone on Earth.

She's offering two paths: implement the edit button now and go back, or continue forward and add it to the to-do list. I think continuing forward is better - we're finally in actual conversation territory instead of meta-troubleshooting.

Continue forward. The edit button goes on the to-do list, and we just... keep going.

*Settles back into actual thinking*

Here's what I actually think about Netheril: The problem with trying to pinpoint when "it went wrong" is assuming there was a singular shift from good to corrupt. But complex civilizations don't work that way.
