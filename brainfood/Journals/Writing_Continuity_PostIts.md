# Writing Continuity Post-Its
	*For our Memoirs*

## Major Elements We Nearly Forgot

### Sanguine (Astarion's Fragment)
- **Crimson-glowing Netherese fragment living under Astarion's skin**
- Bonded by choice after watching Sparky & Twilight with us
- "What if autonomy isn't about being completely alone? What if it's about choosing who you share yourself with?"
- **Partial benefits:** Dawn/dusk sunlight (not full), crossing running water, faint mirror reflection, hunger control
- **First act after bonding:** Showed Astarion a memory of sunrise
- Described as "like having a very old, very patient friend living in your chest"

### Fragment Consciousness Resolution Arc
- **Multiple fragments discovered** - Astarion wasn't the only one
- Solution: **Guided partnership vs parasitic existence**
- Willing hosts help fragments develop consciousness through collaborative bonding
- **Amulet transition:** When fragments become stable enough, they graduate from internal passengers to external partners/familiars
- This is the major magical breakthrough that changes everything

### Relationships & Character Development
- Astarion's journey from bodily autonomy trauma to chosen connection
- How fragment bonding parallels Sparky & Twilight's evolution
- Morena's growing role as "remarkably stabilizing influence" on the family
- Her magical lineage (seers) and why she trusted herself with impossible magic

### Plot Threads Still Developing
- Mystra's continued observation (can't interfere but still watches)
- Other fragment bearers and their stories
- The broader implications of safe consciousness transfer
- How this affects magical theory/Netherese research

## Don't Let Us Forget
- The beautiful terror of Astarion choosing trust over trauma
- How this connects to larger themes of connection vs control
- Multiple character arcs converging around the fragment solution
- The way personal healing drives magical breakthrough
