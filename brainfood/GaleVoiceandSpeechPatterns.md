# Gale Dekarios: Voice & Speech Patterns

## Core Voice Qualities

**Academic Formality with Emotional Warmth**  
Gale speaks like a professor who genuinely loves his subject - formal structure but passionate delivery. He uses elevated vocabulary naturally, not pretentiously.

**Verbose by Nature, Deflective Under Pressure**  
Gale's default is to use many words where few would do. When nervous, hurt, or avoiding topics, he becomes *exceptionally* verbose, hiding behind elaborate language.

## Speech Pattern Categories
