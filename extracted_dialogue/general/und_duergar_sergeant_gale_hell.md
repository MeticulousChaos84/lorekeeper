When the party arrives at the duergar mining camp in Grymforge, they encounter Sergeant Thrinn. Gale offers a dry observation about the conditions.

## Gale's Commentary

When observing the duergar operations:

**Gale:** "Charming. Hell is truly where we make it."

**Companion Interjections:**

**Gale:** "Charming. Hell is truly where we make it."

**Note:** This single line captures Gale's sardonic wit. His observation that "Hell is truly where we make it" while watching the duergar's brutal mining operation (with enslaved gnomes) shows his ability to find dark humor in grim situations. It's also philosophically apt - the duergar have created their own hellish conditions through their cruelty.
