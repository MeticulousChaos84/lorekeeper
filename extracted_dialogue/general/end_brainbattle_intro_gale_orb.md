# Final Battle - Gale's Orb Decision

**Source:** `END_BrainBattle_Intro.html`
**Starting Node:** Various

---

Before ascending to face the Netherbrain, Gale must decide whether to detonate the Netherese orb (sacrificing himself to end the threat immediately) or fight alongside the party. This is one of the most dialogue-heavy scenes in the game.

## Gale Ready to Fight

**Gale:** "I'm ready. Are you?"

## If Player Urges Sacrifice

If the player suggests Gale should use the orb:

**Gale:** "And I would die in the process, just to win the favour of a goddess who scarcely cares for me. We discussed this at length - I thought you and I were of a similar mind."

**Gale:** "You urged me to this point, and now you falter? What would you have me do, sacrifice myself and hope that Mystra eulogises my ashes?"

## If Gale Chooses Sacrifice

**Gale:** "Sometimes I wish I were a more selfish man. Life would be so much easier. But alas..."

**Gale:** "You're right. The orb is the only way. All that's left for me to do is spirit you away to safety. Are you ready?"

**Gale:** "Please... this will be so much easier knowing that my memory lives on with you."

**Gale:** "No. Let me do this on my terms. Besides - I need someone left to sing my praises, after I'm gone."

**Gale:** "I can end this now - stop the Absolute, and spare the city. The stage is set for my final act. Mystra's bidding. And the redemption that lies beyond."

## Gale's Reasoning for Sacrifice

**Gale:** "What's the alternative? I allow the Absolute to have its way? Die in vain along with all its victims? Or flee, and live on in shame?"

**Gale:** "It's just a choice between two deaths. Quick and meaningful, or torturous and pointless."

**Gale:** "I'm sure such an outcome is possible, but why risk it? If we ascend there, and try to fight the good fight... well, there're no guarantees."

**Gale:** "But this way, we'll know the matter is done, and we'll know exactly what it shall cost - me, and me alone."

**Gale:** "It's now, or never."

**Gale:** "This isn't giving up it's securing victory, at a price I am willing to pay. And everything we shared can live on - with you."

**Gale:** "Please. For too long I've lived in fear of taking a host of innocents with me when I expired. Now at least I can be assured my demise will be *saving* them instead."

## If Player Convinces Gale to Fight

**Gale:** "You make it sound like such a small thing. *No* - I do not wish to die."

**Gale:** "If there is even the slimmest chance of success once we ascend, I wish to pursue it."

**Gale:** "No. I can't give up... and I don't want this to be how I part from you. Let us at least try."

**Gale:** "I'm too long in the tooth to play sacrificial lamb - sacrificial bearded goat, more like. I will not just give in to the orb. Not when I've made it this far."

**Gale:** "But... I only made it this far thanks to you. Who am I to question such sterling guidance now?"

**Gale:** "Lead on, then. I shall stay my hand as long as I can - but if the tide of battle turns against us, remember I have the means to bring a swift end to this."

## If Gale is Romanced

**Gale:** "There's endless wonder out there. Infinite possibilities. Perhaps fate will bring us back together, before the universe dims."

**Gale:** "What I want? Perhaps not... But what I need? I believe so. But it may not be the last turn of the page, even if it seems so."

## On Using the Crown Instead

**Gale:** "Your fears are misplaced - the Crown will lead to a better world for all. I cannot ignore that."

**Gale:** "Then I think it's about time we ascended, don't you?"

## Final Confirmations

**Gale:** "If the fight should turn against us, and we have no other option, then rest assured I shall unleash the orb. But I believe there is a much grander destiny in store for us."

**Gale:** "But... perhaps saving the day will suffice for now. A better world can always follow, so long as we survive."

**Gale:** "Should it come to that, I will not hesitate. But I think a different destiny awaits us."

**Gale:** "As viable a plan as any while staring into the maw of perdition. Shall we?"

**Gale:** "I thought I made my feelings plain - I *do not* want to take that step. Not anymore."

**Gale:** "I'm glad. It would be more than a touch awkward if you tried and I had to turn on you."

**Gale:** "That said, should the worst transpire, and we seem destined to fail... well, the orb remains an option. But I truly hope it does not come to that."

**Companion Interjections:**

All dialogue in this scene is Gale's. This is his defining moment - choosing between certain death with guaranteed success, or risking failure for a chance to live.

---

**Note:** This scene showcases Gale's character arc. His early willingness to sacrifice himself ("Sometimes I wish I were a more selfish man") contrasts with his eventual desire to live ("I do not wish to die"). The line "sacrificial bearded goat" shows his humor even in dark moments. His concern about "taking a host of innocents with me" when the orb explodes reveals his constant fear throughout the game.
