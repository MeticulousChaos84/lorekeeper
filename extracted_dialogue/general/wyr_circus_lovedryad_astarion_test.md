Zethino the Love Dryad offers a "Test Your Love" game where the player answers questions about their companion. Astarion's reactions reveal much about his character.

## Agreeing to the Test

Depending on approval level:

**Astarion:** "Oh my love, how could I say no?"
*(If romanced)*

**Astarion:** "Oh I'm the one you love? Well my dear, how could I say no?"
*(High approval)*

**Astarion:** "A sweet gesture, but all... this? It's not really for me."
*(Medium approval - refuses)*

**Astarion:** "Wait, I'm the one you love? Oh no - oh that's so sad."
**Astarion:** "But no, there's absolutely no way this is happening."
*(Low approval - refuses)*

## Question 1: "When is he happiest?"

**Wrong Answer - "I don't think he's ever been happy":**
**Astarion:** "Excuse me? I've been happy, thank you very much."
**Astarion:** "I'm not right now, but whose fault is that?"

**Correct Answer - "When he's elbow-deep in gore":**
**Astarion:** "Guilty as charged. Sometimes literally..."

**Wrong Answer - "He's happy right now - look at that smile!":**
**Astarion:** "It's a grimace, sweetie. Not off to a great start."

## Question 2: "What does he desire more than anything?"

**Wrong Answer - "Me":**
**Astarion:** "Oh you're very sweet. I wouldn't say no to some gory vengeance personally, but that was an adorable answer."

**Wrong Answer - "Freedom":**
**Astarion:** "You're not wrong, but do we need to tell every stranger we meet our business?"

**Correct Answer - "Revenge":**
**Astarion:** "Oh yes. Yes please."

**Wrong Answer - "A nice, tasty rat":**
**Astarion:** "Urgh, really? Of all the things you could think of - that?"

**Companion Interjections:**

**Astarion:** "Guilty as charged. Sometimes literally..."

**Astarion:** "Oh yes. Yes please."

**Astarion:** "It's a grimace, sweetie. Not off to a great start."

**Astarion:** "You're not wrong, but do we need to tell every stranger we meet our business?"

**Note:** This scene brilliantly reveals Astarion's priorities and self-awareness. The "correct" answers are darkly telling: he's happiest killing people ("elbow-deep in gore") and desires revenge above all else. His enthusiastic "Oh yes. Yes please" about revenge shows his obsession with destroying Cazador. The "wrong" answers are equally revealing - even "Freedom," which seems appropriate, gets a -1 because while true, he's uncomfortable sharing his trauma with strangers. His refusal at low approval ("Oh no - oh that's so sad") is vintage Astarion cruelty. The contrast between his grimace and the player thinking he's smiling captures his performative nature perfectly.
