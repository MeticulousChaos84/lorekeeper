When confronting the orthon Yurgir in his lair, Astarion has unique dialogue if he's accepted Raphael's deal to kill Yurgir in exchange for information about his scars.

## Upon Meeting Yurgir

If Astarion has Raphael's quest:

**Astarion:** "So he's the one who slaughtered the Justiciars - we can kill him now?"

**Astarion:** "Because if he doesn't die, then Raphael won't tell me a damn thing about my scars."

## After Convincing Yurgir to Kill Himself

If Astarion has Raphael's quest:

**Astarion:** "Does... does that count as us killing him? That had better count."

If Astarion doesn't have Raphael's quest:

**Astarion:** "That was incredible - I'm actually impressed! You have a wicked little mind."

**Gale:** "I see the art of eloquence is alive and well. I'm awed, impressed, and a little bit scared of you right now."

**Companion Interjections:**

**Astarion:** "So he's the one who slaughtered the Justiciars - we can kill him now?"

**Astarion:** "Because if he doesn't die, then Raphael won't tell me a damn thing about my scars."

**Astarion:** "Does... does that count as us killing him? That had better count."

**Gale:** "I see the art of eloquence is alive and well. I'm awed, impressed, and a little bit scared of you right now."

**Note:** This scene reveals Astarion's desperation to understand his scars. His urgent "we can kill him now?" shows he's thinking only of Raphael's deal, not the tactical situation. The follow-up line makes his motivation explicit - Raphael holds information about the mysterious scars Cazador carved into his back, and Astarion needs Yurgir dead to get it. His panicked "That had better count" when Yurgir kills himself shows his anxiety about whether Raphael will honor the technicality. Gale's reaction to the player's persuasion ("a little bit scared of you") shows the moral ambiguity of convincing someone to commit suicide, even a devil's servant.
