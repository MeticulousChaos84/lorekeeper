When encountering Rolan in the Druid Grove, the tiefling wizard boasts about his upcoming apprenticeship with Lorroakan. If Gale is present, he interjects with his own knowledge of the famous (or infamous) wizard.

## Gale's Knowledge of Lorroakan

When Rolan mentions Lorroakan:

**Gale:** "I've heard that name before. A young man, yes? Lives in Ramazith's Tower in the Upper City?"

**Rolan:** "The very same!"

**Gale:** "Word in Waterdeep has it he's a bit of a cad. But you say he's an accomplished wizard?"

**Rolan:** "Of course he is! The greatest spellcaster along the Sword Coast. As if I'd settle for a lesser mentor."

**Gale:** "In that case, I'd very much appreciate it if you could arrange an introduction should we reach the city."

### If the Player Tells Gale to Focus

When urged to remember their pressing problem:

**Gale:** "Merely planning ahead. Besides, never hurts to befriend a wizard."

**Companion Interjections:**

**Gale:** "I've heard that name before. A young man, yes? Lives in Ramazith's Tower in the Upper City?"

**Gale:** "Word in Waterdeep has it he's a bit of a cad. But you say he's an accomplished wizard?"

**Gale:** "In that case, I'd very much appreciate it if you could arrange an introduction should we reach the city."

**Gale:** "Merely planning ahead. Besides, never hurts to befriend a wizard."

**Note:** This scene reveals Gale's reputation in arcane circles - he's heard of Lorroakan even from Waterdeep. His careful phrasing ("a bit of a cad") is diplomatic understatement; Lorroakan will prove to be far worse than that. Gale's eager request for an introduction shows his wizard networking instincts, though his later encounter with Lorroakan will be deeply disappointing. This also foreshadows the Nightsong questline, as Lorroakan's obsession with the Nightsong will drive much of Act 3.
