When Viconia offers to take Shadowheart for "reeducation" if the player hands her over, companions strongly object.

## Reactions to Betraying Shadowheart

When the player considers handing over Shadowheart:

**Gale:** "Shadowheart is one of *us.* Betray her, and you betray us all."

**Astarion:** "Sure, fine - whatever we have to say to escape this woman."

## Reactions to "Reeducation"

When Viconia promises to "reeducate" Shadowheart:

**Gale:** "Do not insult our intelligence. You'd *erase* her, make a blank vellum of her mind, her memories, and inscribe it with your poison."

**Astarion:** "'Reeducation' sounds an awful lot like enslavement to me."

**Companion Interjections:**

**Gale:** "Shadowheart is one of *us.* Betray her, and you betray us all."

**Gale:** "Do not insult our intelligence. You'd *erase* her, make a blank vellum of her mind, her memories, and inscribe it with your poison."

**Astarion:** "Sure, fine - whatever we have to say to escape this woman."

**Astarion:** "'Reeducation' sounds an awful lot like enslavement to me."

**Note:** These reactions reveal much about both characters' values. Gale's responses are passionately protective - "Betray her, and you betray us all" shows he views the party as family. His second line uses writerly metaphors ("blank vellum," "inscribe") to describe the horror of mind-wiping, showing both his intellectual nature and genuine disgust. Astarion's first line is dismissive pragmatism - he doesn't care what they say to escape. But his second line is deeply personal: after 200 years of being Cazador's thrall, he recognizes "reeducation" for what it really is - enslavement. This is one of the rare moments where Astarion's trauma surfaces in a direct moral stance rather than dark humor.
