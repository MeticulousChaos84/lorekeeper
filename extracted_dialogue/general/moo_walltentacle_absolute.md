At Moonrise Towers, the player encounters a tentacle emerging from the wall that grabs their arm. The Absolute speaks through it, demanding the player come to her. Companions react when the player escapes.

## Astarion's Reaction

When the player escapes the tentacle:

**Astarion:** "Thank goodness - I was almost worried."

**Astarion:** "Clingy little shit, this Absolute. And She wants to meet..."

Other companions' versions:
- Karlach: "The Absolute fairly ripped your hand off. That's no way to tempt us into a meeting."

**Companion Interjections:**

**Astarion:** "Thank goodness - I was almost worried."

**Astarion:** "Clingy little shit, this Absolute. And She wants to meet..."

**Note:** Astarion's "almost worried" shows his typical deflection of genuine concern with sarcasm. His dismissive "Clingy little shit" reduces a terrifying elder brain-controlled tentacle to the level of an annoying ex-lover - classic Astarion bravado in the face of cosmic horror.
