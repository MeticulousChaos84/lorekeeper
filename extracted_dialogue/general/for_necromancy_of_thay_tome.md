**Gale:** "What are you doing? That's no way to treat a book!"

### Giving the Book to Astarion

**Approval:** Astarion +5, Gale -5

**Astarion:** "Excellent."

The narrator notes: "You don't know what he read, but it had an effect. His eyes are hungry, but pained."

### Opening the Book Yourself

**Approval:** Astarion -1, Gale -5, Karlach -1
