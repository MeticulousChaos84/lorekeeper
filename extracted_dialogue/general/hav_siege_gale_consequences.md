# Last Light Inn - Siege Aftermath

**Starting Node:** Various

If the player murders Isobel (either directly or by allowing her to be taken), the protective ward around Last Light Inn falls and everyone transforms into shadow-cursed undead. Gale has a pointed reaction.

## Gale's Condemnation

When observing the destruction:

**Gale:** "Behold, the consequences of your actions."

**Companion Interjections:**

**Gale:** "Behold, the consequences of your actions."

**Note:** This single devastating line captures Gale at his most disappointed. Unlike his usual verbose explanations, this biblical-sounding pronouncement ("Behold") shows he has no interest in softening the blow. The player's choice has killed everyone in the inn, and Gale wants them to witness it fully. It's one of the few times Gale is genuinely cold rather than diplomatic.
