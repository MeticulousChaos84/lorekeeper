**Source:** `COL_KethericShowdown_CrownController.html`
**Starting Node:** 60

---

After defeating Ketheric and looting the Crown Controller stone from his body, the Dream Guardian emerges from a portal to explain what the player has discovered.

## The Netherstone Revealed

The Dream Guardian (depending on dialogue track) says:
- "Remarkable. Truly."
- "You did well. Really well."
- "So it is accomplished. The first step."

They continue: "And now the picture comes together. The Absolute is neither god nor man. It is the elder brain you saw, held here by those three against its will. The crown it wears controls it, and these stones control the crown. It has been dominated."

"To master an elder brain... to *subdue* it... Our enemies are formidable."

## The Crown's Origin

When asked about the crown (or the stones):

"The crown's markings suggest it was forged in Netheril, an ancient empire whose mastery over magic rivalled that of the gods. It is a crown of domination. The stones were taken from its crest. They are Netherstones, imbued with the ability to control the wearer of the crown."

"The crown's Netherese magic must be the true source of the parasites' abilities. This must be what elevates their potential."

If the player has sought a cure previously: "And it must be the reason nobody could heal you."

"If the crown can do this to the parasites, I dare not imagine what it is doing to the brain."

## Gale's Reactions

**Gale:** "Whoever controls the crown could reshape the world... *if* they can control it."

**Gale:** "Netherese power like nothing anyone's seen in ages. They say magic led to the destruction of Netheril itself..."

**Gale:** "Netherese? These Chosen are powerful indeed to have such magic in their command."

## The Dead Three Revealed

When asked about their enemies:

The Dream Guardian explains one is Lord Enver Gortash - "an arms dealer and a slaver. A worshipper of Bane, the god of tyranny."

If Karlach is present, she already knows Gortash, and the Guardian acknowledges she has faced his tyranny herself.

The other (Orin) is likely a follower of Bhaal - god of murder.

"Ketheric was a follower of Myrkul. Which means the Absolute is a front for the gods of death and our enemies are the Chosen of the Dead Three."

When asked to explain: "Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul. The tyrant, the assassin, and the necromancer. They are known to pick from their most devout followers a Chosen, granting them incredible powers. Each one alone would be a formidable enemy. But working together, and controlling an *elder brain*... I dare not imagine what they might achieve."

## The Mission Ahead

The Dream Guardian explains the stakes:

"We prepare for the fight of our lives, and the lives of everyone in Faerûn. The army of the Absolute is marching on Baldur's Gate. Within the city, an elder brain brimming with power, ready to turn everyone within its reach into mind flayers. All it needs is an order. An order the death gods' Chosen are on the cusp of giving."

"We must wrest control of the brain from the Chosen before that happens - we must take their stones. Our chances of success are slim, but we must not fail. If we fail, everything ends."

"I will be your shield, but you must be the sword. And when the chance to strike comes, you must take it. For there may only be one chance."
