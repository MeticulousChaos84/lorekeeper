# Gale - Mystra Confrontation in the Outer Planes

**Source:** `END_GameFinale_MystraGaleConfrontation.html`
**Starting Node:** 2

---

After absorbing the Crown of Karsus and gaining the power of a minor god, Gale is summoned to the outer planes by Mystra. A new constellation forms in the shape of Gale's tattoo, tendrils of Netherese magic flickering around him. Mystra's sigil appears opposite his, glowing with the pure white/blue of the Weave.

Mystra asks: "So, Gale of Waterdeep, you have become the inheritor of Karsus' powers at last. Tell me. What do you intend to do with them?"

---

## Path 1: Surrender the Crown

**Gale:** "I came to surrender them. The Crown, the Karsite Weave - take it all."

### If Gale is a mind flayer:

Mystra acknowledges his sacrifice: "This offering cost you greatly. There is no hope in life as an illithid, devoid of soul and conscience. It is within my power to restore your soul, and your humanity, if you are willing to leave the mortal realms behind. Return with me, to Elysium."

**If Gale has a romantic partner:**

**Gale:** "Thank you, but no. I have someone waiting for me."

**If Gale wants to stay mortal:**

**Gale:** "Perhaps one day, but for now there is more I need to accomplish."

**If Gale is content as an illithid:**

**Gale:** "Being an illithid has its advantages. I'm content as I am."

**If Gale is undecided:**

**Gale:** "I'll consider your offer. Thank you."

**If Gale accepts Elysium:**

**Gale:** "I crave nothing more. Take me to Elysium."

Mystra transforms him: "So be it. Gale of Waterdeep, Chosen of Mystra."

### If Gale is not a mind flayer:

Mystra praises him: "Spoken like the wizard you were meant to be. You do a great service here. Not only for your goddess, but for magic itself. It will never be forgotten. Nor will I forget you."

**If Gale simply wants to move on:**

**Gale:** "I only wanted to make things right. We need never see each other again."

Mystra responds: "Go, Gale of Waterdeep. Your life is your own at last. It's time you went and lived it."

**If Gale wants to be Chosen again:**

**Gale:** "I want to be your Chosen once more. And this time, I won't let you down."

Mystra accepts: "So be it. Gale of Waterdeep, Chosen of Mystra."

**If Gale wants to renew their romance:**

**Gale:** "I want you back, Mystra. I want us to be lovers again."

If he has a partner, Mystra redirects him: "You already love another, Gale. I see them, waiting for you. It is to them you must return."

If single: "Patience, Gale. All in good time..."

In all surrender endings, Mystra promises: "Then you are free to go with both my thanks and my promise - henceforth, your prayers will always be answered."

## Path 2: Become the God of Ambition

**Gale:** "I will become a new kind of god. One with *ambition*."

Mystra responds coldly: "Ambition. A fitting domain, for that is the only thing you will have to offer your worshippers."

"Know this - the Weave will never answer to you. Set your 'ambition' to that purpose, and you will feel the wrath of a true god. One worthy of the name."

Mystra disappears, and Gale's powers fully manifest. His symbol appears in the Astral expanse, glowing with power. The God of Ambition has arrived.

## Path 3: Challenge Mystra for the Weave

**Gale:** "I'm here for your godhood, Mystra. I'm going to rule the Weave."

Mystra, ice cold: "You think yourself capable of it? Come then, let us put your ambition to the test."

Both adopt combat poses, their symbols growing in intensity like storms. As their magical forces make contact:

**Mystra:** "You should have remained mortal, Gale of Waterdeep. You would have lived longer."
