In the Shadow-Cursed Lands, Raphael offers Astarion a deal: kill Yurgir the orthon for him, and he'll translate the scars on Astarion's back. This scene reveals Astarion's pragmatism and desperation to understand what Cazador carved into him.

## Astarion's Pragmatic Acceptance

When Raphael proposes the deal:

**Astarion:** "A fairer deal than I expected."

**Astarion:** "This is serious business, devil."

**Astarion:** "Yes, fine, we'll kill this damn creature of yours."

## Astarion's Optimistic Take

When the player questions the deal:

**Astarion:** "What's not to like? We kill some horrible beastie, and I get what I want in return. Everyone's happy."

**Astarion:** "Except the beastie."

## Convincing the Player

**Astarion:** "Let's not be so hasty - we might enjoy doing the devil's dirty work."

**Astarion:** "And it's all for a good cause - me."

## Raphael Reveals the Scars

When Raphael magicks away his shirt:

**Astarion:** "Gods damn it."

After the reveal:

**Astarion:** "Well. Now you know."

## Discussing Why He Didn't Tell Them

**Astarion:** "I - perhaps I should have, but I'm not used to asking for help and being met with, well... help."

**Astarion:** "But what's done is done, so how about we stop discussing it and just kill this beast?"

## Describing the Torture

**Astarion:** "Cazador worked on it from dusk until dawn, all with an ancient blade he called his 'needle'. Cutting and tearing, starting over if I screamed or winced too much."

**Astarion:** "It was a rough night."

## Moving Forward

**Astarion:** "It could be infinitely worse. We seem to be rather good at killing things."

**Astarion:** "Let's just go. Standing here chatting gets us nowhere."

**Astarion:** "Although I should probably get dressed first..."

**Astarion:** "Except the beastie."

**Astarion:** "Let's not be so hasty - we might enjoy doing the devil's dirty work."

**Astarion:** "And it's all for a good cause - me."

**Astarion:** "Gods damn it."

**Note:** This scene perfectly encapsulates Astarion's character. His "Everyone's happy - Except the beastie" shows his dark humor. "All for a good cause - me" reveals his unapologetic self-interest, yet his willingness to make deals with devils to understand his trauma shows his desperation. The understatement "It was a rough night" is classic Astarion - minimizing horrific torture with dark wit. His "not used to asking for help and being met with... help" shows how deeply his trust was damaged by 200 years of exploitation.
