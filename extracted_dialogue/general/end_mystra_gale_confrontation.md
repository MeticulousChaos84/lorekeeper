**Starting Node:** Various

After Gale claims the Crown of Karsus and gains the power of a minor god, he meets Mystra in the outer planes. This scene determines his final fate based on player choices.

## Mystra's Opening

**Mystra:** "So, Gale of Waterdeep, you have become the inheritor of Karsus' powers at last."

**Mystra:** "Tell me. What do you intend to do with them?"

## Path 1: Surrendering to Mystra

**Gale:** "I came to surrender them. The Crown, the Karsite Weave - take it all."

### If Gale Became a Mind Flayer

**Mystra:** "This offering cost you greatly. There is no hope in life as an illithid, devoid of soul and conscience."

**Mystra:** "It is within my power to restore your soul, and your humanity, if you are willing to leave the mortal realms behind. Return with me, to Elysium."

**Gale:** "Thank you, but no. I have someone waiting for me." (if romanced)

**Gale:** "Perhaps one day, but for now there is more I need to accomplish."

**Gale:** "Being an illithid has its advantages. I'm content as I am."

**Gale:** "I'll consider your offer. Thank you."

**Gale:** "I crave nothing more. Take me to Elysium."

**Mystra:** "So be it. Gale of Waterdeep, Chosen of Mystra."

### Standard Surrender Path

**Mystra:** "Spoken like the wizard you were meant to be."

**Mystra:** "You do a great service here. Not only for your goddess, but for magic itself. It will never be forgotten. Nor will I forget you."

**Gale:** "I only wanted to make things right. We need never see each other again."

**Mystra:** "Then you are free to go with both my thanks and my promise - henceforth, your prayers will always be answered."

**Mystra:** "Go, Gale of Waterdeep. Your life is your own at last. It's time you went and lived it."

### Becoming Chosen Again

**Gale:** "I want to be your Chosen once more. And this time, I won't let you down."

**Mystra:** "So be it. Gale of Waterdeep, Chosen of Mystra."

### Asking to Be Lovers Again

**Gale:** "I want you back, Mystra. I want us to be lovers again."

**Mystra:** "You already love another, Gale. I see them, waiting for you. It is to them you must return." (if romanced)

**Mystra:** "Patience, Gale. All in good time..."

## Path 2: Becoming God of Ambition

**Gale:** "I will become a new kind of god. One with *ambition*."

**Mystra:** "Ambition. A fitting domain, for that is the only thing you will have to offer your worshippers."

**Mystra:** "Know this - the Weave will never answer to you. Set your 'ambition' to that purpose, and you will feel the wrath of a true god. One worthy of the name."

## Path 3: Challenging Mystra for Godhood

**Gale:** "I'm here for your godhood, Mystra. I'm going to rule the Weave."

**Mystra:** "You think yourself capable of it? Come then, let us put your ambition to the test."

**Mystra:** "You should have remained mortal, Gale of Waterdeep. You would have lived longer."

**Companion Interjections:**

This scene is entirely Gale and Mystra. No companions are present in the outer planes.

**Gale:** "I came to surrender them. The Crown, the Karsite Weave - take it all."

**Gale:** "Thank you, but no. I have someone waiting for me."

**Gale:** "I only wanted to make things right. We need never see each other again."

**Gale:** "I want to be your Chosen once more. And this time, I won't let you down."

**Gale:** "I want you back, Mystra. I want us to be lovers again."

**Gale:** "I will become a new kind of god. One with *ambition*."

**Gale:** "I'm here for your godhood, Mystra. I'm going to rule the Weave."

---

**Note:** This scene represents Gale's three possible endings: redemption (surrendering the Crown), ambition (becoming a god), or hubris (challenging Mystra herself). The contrast between "Your life is your own at last" and "You should have remained mortal" perfectly captures the divergent fates. Gale's line "I have someone waiting for me" shows that romance can override even his desire for Mystra's favor.
