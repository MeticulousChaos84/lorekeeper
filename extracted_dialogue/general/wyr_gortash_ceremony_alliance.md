At Wyrm's Rock Fortress, the player attends Gortash's coronation as Archduke. He proposes an alliance against Orin. Astarion comments on the pragmatic value of this arrangement.

## Astarion's Assessment

When considering allying with Gortash:

**Astarion:** "An ally could be useful, at least for now. And when he's no longer useful - well, we can dispose of him then."

**Companion Interjections:**

**Astarion:** "An ally could be useful, at least for now. And when he's no longer useful - well, we can dispose of him then."

**Note:** This line perfectly captures Astarion's pragmatic ruthlessness. He sees allies as tools to be used and discarded. His casual "dispose of him then" shows he's already planning betrayal before the alliance is even formed - a mindset likely shaped by 200 years of Cazador's manipulations.
