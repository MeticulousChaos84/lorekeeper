At the Sharess' Caress brothel, the player can hire the drow twins Nym and Sorn for a threesome. If Astarion or Gale are romanced, they can be invited to join.

## Astarion's Participation

If invited to join:

**Astarion:** "And don't worry, I'll dart out if I don't enjoy it faster than I used to run from the sun."

On paying for services:

**Astarion:** "What a world. I never dreamed I'd be on the *paying* end in a brothel."

If not romanced but invited:

**Astarion:** "But, our leader here has made the dire mistake of failing to sleep with me so far, and it's a mistake I have been *aching* to correct."

If shown kindness:

**Astarion:** "Eugh, don't be so nice to me! It makes me want to be nice back."

## Gale's Declination

If Gale is romanced and invited:

**Gale:** "You're adorable even when you're teasing me. But I must decline."

**Gale:** "I appreciate that - but I can't help how I feel."

**Note:** This scene showcases the characters' different approaches to intimacy. Astarion's line about "the *paying* end in a brothel" darkly references his 200 years as Cazador's spawn, when he was forced to seduce victims. His "don't be so nice to me" shows discomfort with genuine affection. Gale's polite declination shows his preference for monogamy and emotional connection over casual encounters.
