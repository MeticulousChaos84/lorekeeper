At the Murder Tribunal beneath the city, Sarevok reveals that the sacrifice demanded by Bhaal is a hollyphant - a small, cute celestial elephant with wings. Companions react with disbelief at this twisted "joke."

## Companion Reactions to the Sacrifice

One companion (randomly selected) comments:

**Gale:** "I never credited Bhaal with a sense of humour. This is some sick joke of his - let's not be part of it."

**Astarion:** "This is the grand sacrifice demanded by Bhaal? *This?*"

Other companions' versions:
- Shadowheart: "*This* is Bhaal's sacrifice...? Wouldn't have been my first guess. Or my tenth."
- Minsc: "This leathered balloon is bound. Helpless. If there must be blood spilled on this floor, Boo has some better ideas of who it should belong to."
- Halsin: "*This* is the sacrifice that Bhaal demands? I had expected something more... auspicious, perhaps."

**Companion Interjections:**

**Gale:** "I never credited Bhaal with a sense of humour. This is some sick joke of his - let's not be part of it."

**Astarion:** "This is the grand sacrifice demanded by Bhaal? *This?*"

**Note:** The hollyphant is a celestial creature of pure good - the polar opposite of Bhaal's murder domain. Gale recognizes this as Bhaal's "sick joke" and urges the player not to participate. Astarion's incredulous repetition of "*This?*" shows even he finds the cruelty excessive. The scene tests whether the player will murder an innocent to gain power.
