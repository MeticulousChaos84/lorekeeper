# Kagha's Snake Court - Arabella Trial

**Source:** `DEN_ShadowDruid_SnakesCourt.html`
**Starting Node:** Various

---

When the player enters Kagha's chambers, they find the druid threatening a young tiefling girl named Arabella with her snake Teela. Arabella took the Idol of Silvanus to try to stop the ritual.

## When the Player Considers Attacking

If the player reaches for their weapon but then reconsiders:

**Astarion:** "Don't be a coward. We could take them. We could kill them all."

**Gale:** "Good. Let's focus on the girl first. We can settle with the snake later."

**Wyll:** "A fickle one, aren't you? I hope you know what you're doing."

## When the Player Prepares to Attack

If the player decides to attack Kagha and the druids:

**Astarion:** "Yes! Let's have some fun."

**Gale:** "Hold on! It's not too late to settle this without bloodshed."

**Wyll:** "This Kagha's barbaric. Know this: I've got your back."

**Shadowheart:** "*Leave it.* Remember why we're here."

**Karlach:** "Wait! Don't spook the gods-damn snake!"

If the attack proceeds, Kagha declares: "The outlander must strike on Zevlor's behalf! Call the circle to arms - we will cleanse the grove of parasites, once and for all."
