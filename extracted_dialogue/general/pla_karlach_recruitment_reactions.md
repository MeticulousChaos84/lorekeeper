When recruiting Karlach after encountering her on the Risen Road, companions have varied reactions to adding the blood-soaked tiefling to the party.

## Reactions to Recruiting Karlach

**Astarion:** "You want to just team up with some blood-stained killer? Because I'm fine with that."

**Astarion:** "She's almost as scary as you, Lae'zel. So naturally she gets my vote."
*(If Lae'zel is present)*

**Gale:** "She's, erm, perhaps a little rough around the edges... but I suppose I can be smooth enough for two..."

## When Being Swapped Out for Karlach

If the player replaces Astarion with Karlach:

**Astarion:** "If I must. But do try to keep them safe - they're a little useless without me."

**Astarion:** "Oh, gladly. This circus is all yours, my friend."

**Astarion:** "I would object, but sitting by the fire while you do all the hard work sounds marvellous, actually."

If the player replaces Gale with Karlach:

**Gale:** "I'll get little rest given the stack of unread books waiting for me - but I'll try."

**Gale:** "The mind is strong, but the knees... well, they are a little sore. I'll gladly put my feet up."

**Gale:** "Keeping your greatest weapon in reserve, eh? An excellent strategy."

**Companion Interjections:**

**Astarion:** "You want to just team up with some blood-stained killer? Because I'm fine with that."

**Astarion:** "She's almost as scary as you, Lae'zel. So naturally she gets my vote."

**Gale:** "She's, erm, perhaps a little rough around the edges... but I suppose I can be smooth enough for two..."

**Note:** These reactions perfectly capture both characters. Astarion's initial skepticism ("blood-stained killer") immediately gives way to approval - of course he's fine with killers, he is one. His comparison to Lae'zel ("almost as scary") is high praise from him. When benched, his ego shows: "they're a little useless without me" and treating rest as "marvellous" because others do the work. Gale's response to Karlach is diplomatically cautious ("rough around the edges") with characteristic self-regard ("smooth enough for two"). When benched, his responses range from bookish ("stack of unread books") to self-deprecating ("the knees... are a little sore") to cheeky ("greatest weapon in reserve").
