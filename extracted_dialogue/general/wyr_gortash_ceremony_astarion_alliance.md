During Gortash's coronation ceremony at Wyrm's Rock, when he warns about Orin's shapeshifting abilities and proposes an alliance, Astarion has characteristically pragmatic reactions.

## Shapeshifter Paranoia

When Gortash warns that Orin could be disguised as anyone in their party:

**Astarion:** "A shapeshifter? It could be anyone."

**Astarion:** "I mean - it's not me, but it could be anyone else."

## On the Alliance with Gortash

When considering whether to ally with Gortash:

**Astarion:** "An ally could be useful, at least for now. And when he's no longer useful - well, we can dispose of him then."

**Companion Interjections:**

**Astarion:** "A shapeshifter? It could be anyone."

**Astarion:** "I mean - it's not me, but it could be anyone else."

**Astarion:** "An ally could be useful, at least for now. And when he's no longer useful - well, we can dispose of him then."

**Note:** These lines showcase Astarion's pragmatic approach to alliances and his dark humor. His immediate clarification ("I mean - it's not me") after saying "it could be anyone" is peak comedy - he's quick to ensure he's not under suspicion himself. His stance on allying with Gortash is pure Astarion pragmatism: allies are tools to be used and discarded. His casual mention of disposing of Gortash "when he's no longer useful" shows he thinks in terms of ruthless efficiency rather than morality. This approach mirrors how he survived 200 years under Cazador - by being useful and never trusting anyone's stated intentions.
