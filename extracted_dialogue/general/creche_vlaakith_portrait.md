# Vlaakith Portrait - Creche Corridor

**Source:** `CRE_General_VlaakithPortrait.html`
**Starting Node:** 13

---

In the Creche corridor, the player encounters a resplendent portrait of Queen Vlaakith. Non-githyanki characters see it as "a truly resplendent portrait of Queen Vlaakith in all her glory" while githyanki characters see "this imposing portrait depicts a powerful githyanki warrior, undeniably regal in her mien."

## Lae'zel's Reverence

**Lae'zel:** "Vlaakith herself. She is both the sun that blinds us and the void that contains us. Praise be."

The narrator notes: "In the corner of the painting is a small symbol you can't quite place."

## Examining the Portrait

Studying Vlaakith's features (non-githyanki): "This githyanki looks different from the others you've seen here. The way her stark white skin stretches over her sharp features gives her a distinctly otherworldly aspect."

Studying Vlaakith's features (githyanki): "That face, that expression, brimming with might and glory. Her power and beauty are beyond words."

## The Orpheus Symbol

An Intelligence/History check (DC 21 for non-githyanki, DC 14 for githyanki) reveals the symbol in the corner:

Non-githyanki success: "You remember seeing this symbol in a book about the denizens of the Astral Plane. It appears to be a depiction of a comet."

Githyanki success: "You recall stories of a prince riding a comet just like this one. With sudden clarity, you realise it's the symbol of Orpheus - a forgotten hero from the tales of your youth."

### Lae'zel's Reactions to the Symbol

If Lae'zel is on the Orpheus path:

**Lae'zel:** "The sign of Orpheus. Centuries gone, yet his influence stretches across the planes."

**Lae'zel:** "Blasphemy, to scrawl it here. And a colossal risk."

If Lae'zel is loyal to Vlaakith:

**Lae'zel:** "The sign of Orpheus? Blasphemy. Would I could quarter the vandal myself."

## Vandalizing the Portrait

The player can choose to draw on the portrait (DC 16 Dexterity):

**Approval:** Astarion +1, Karlach +1, Shadowheart +1. Lae'zel -1.

### On Success

Non-githyanki: "You take a moment to fully appreciate your masterpiece. She certainly looks a little less regal now."

Githyanki: "You take a moment to fully appreciate your masterpiece. The prickle of transgression wrestles with your amusement at your own handiwork."

**Lae'zel's Reactions:**

If she has some approval of the player:

**Lae'zel:** "A wretched display. I thought you better than such juvenile antics."

If she has low approval:

**Lae'zel:** "Pathetic and profane. You've the brain of a child."

If the player is githyanki:

**Lae'zel:** "*Kainyank!* I should take your head for such blasphemy. But I'll save the pleasure for Vlaakith herself."

(Kainyank means "Cursed child")

### On Failure

The player slips and is caught by Youth Vis'kiir, who panics: "What did you do? The queen! Her face! *Vlaakith m' zath'ak!*"

He demands: "Get out of here, *hshar'lak*! I need to clean this off before they see or we're *all* going to suffer for it."

(hshar'lak means "traitor")
