# Gale - Romance Ending: Morning After Victory

**Source:** `END_GameFinale_RomanceFates_Gale.html`
**Starting Node:** 49

---

The morning after defeating the Netherbrain, Gale awakens in a private room at the Elfsong Tavern with his romantic partner. He reflects on their victory and their future together.

## Opening

**Gale:** "It's curious. After all the wonders and monstrosities we've witnessed, waking beside you seems more unreal than any of it."

**Gale:** "I'd forgotten what it felt like, to greet a sunrise without fear of it being my last."

## Special Branch: Karlach Partner

If the player is Karlach (who is dying without returning to Avernus), Gale realizes his insensitivity:

**Gale:** "Oh, hells. I'm sorry. Barely awake a moment and I've already put my foot in it."

If Karlach says it's not his fault:

**Gale:** "Come now - resignation doesn't suit you half as well as optimism. We'll find some other means of fixing up that infernal engine of yours."

**Gale:** "When we get to Waterdeep, we'll search in my library. It's bound to contain the odd scroll on hellish thermodynamics. Or a spell that might diffuse the heat in such a way that -"

**Gale:** "Ah. But I'm getting ahead of myself. Do you... that is, would you consider returning to Waterdeep with me?"

### If Karlach refuses to return to Avernus:

**Gale:** "What, then? You intend to die here? Now?"

Or if she says her engine is done:

**Gale:** "I - I don't believe it. I *won't* believe it."

**Gale:** "If you were to return to the hells - temporarily - it would buy us some time. I could put *something* together, a means of keeping you stable at least. Please, let me try."

### Gale offers to go to Avernus:

**Gale:** "What if... what if I went with you?"

If Karlach says he deserves better:

**Gale:** "I deserve the chance to live my life with the raging inferno I love. If that means relocating to the hells, so be it. I've heard Avernus is quite lovely this time of year."

**Gale:** "Besides, it would be quite something to study infernal magic in its natural environs. I say 'natural' in the loosest sense, of course."

If Karlach accepts his company:

**Gale:** "There's *nothing* we can't handle - I promise you that."

**Gale:** "It's taken me long enough to find you. I'll be damned if I'm letting you go."

### If Karlach chooses death:

**Gale:** "If this is the end, then we face it together. That, at least, I can promise you."

## The Orb's Status

**If Gale gave the Crown to Mystra:**

**Gale:** "Soon, I'll deliver the crown to Mystra, and be rid of the orb at long last. I'll be free."

**If Gale did not give the Crown to Mystra:**

**Gale:** "It's strange, but somehow I woke up this morning and realised the orb feels different. No clamour, no desperation, no *hunger*."

**Gale:** "I hesitate to say it, but I think it's... satisfied."

**Gale:** "I'll need to keep a careful study of it, make sure it's not suddenly destabilised by proximity to a rogue pair of Netherese sandals or what have you, but I think it's dormant."

**Gale:** "That's one worry I can leave behind me, at least."

## The Proposal

Gale prepares to ask the most important question:

**Gale:** "Now, I believe this is the moment where I should get to my point, so to speak."

**Gale:** "I love you, more than I've ever loved anyone, mortal or immortal. And you've proven your love for me in more ways than even the greatest mathematicians would dare to count."

**Gale:** "That being said, I wondered if you might consider accompanying me back to Waterdeep as a new member of the Dekarios clan?"

### If the player asks directly:

**Gale:** "I suppose I am. Tara would be delighted. Not to mention my mother. But I'd be just as happy without such ceremony, so long as we're together."

### If the player is a mind flayer:

**Gale:** "Your 'present condition' is that you're the one I love. And your current form is merely a reflection of the depths of your sacrifice. It only makes me love you more."

**Gale:** "There will be some practicalities to iron out. The guest list, the venue, and we'll need to find a *very* open-minded cleric."

**Gale:** "I promise we'll make it work, if you'll have me?"

### If the player accepts marriage:

**Gale:** "You will? Oh, thank goodness for that."

**Gale:** "We'll need time to make the arrangements of course - the Dekarios clan is scattered far and wide, and you'll have invites of your own to send out, I'm sure."

**Gale:** "The day is young, and there are thousands more days ahead of us."

### If the player accepts but won't move to Waterdeep:

**Gale:** "Then I go where you go. Waterdeep wouldn't be home without you, anyway."

(For mind flayer player, regarding the wedding:)
**Gale:** "We'll need time to make the arrangements, of course. The catering alone will need to be quite extraordinary..."

### If the player declines marriage but agrees to go to Waterdeep:

**Gale:** "You can't blame a fellow for trying. If you're contented as we are, then so am I."

**Gale:** "That does lead me to a more pressing matter. Exactly how large is your library?"
