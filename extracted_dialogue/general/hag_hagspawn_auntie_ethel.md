When the party encounters Auntie Ethel confronting Mayrina in the swamp, companions can offer their opinions on whether to get involved.

## Companion Reactions

When asked whether to intervene:

**Astarion:** "Let's not make trouble for some stranger. We have our own problems."

Other companions:
- Lae'zel: "If battle is inevitable, let it be so. I tire of pleasantries."
- Shadowheart: "I'm inclined to agree. Let's not involve ourselves in this place any more than necessary."
- Wyll: "The girl's in a fix. It's a hero's duty to step in."
- Karlach: "I don't like this. What's *really* going on here?"

## Approval Impacts

If the player chooses to help Mayrina despite companions' advice:

**Player:** "No. This woman is clearly in trouble."
- Astarion: -1 (disapproves of helping strangers)
- Gale: +1 (approves of heroic intervention)
- Wyll: +1
- Karlach: +1

**Companion Interjections:**

**Astarion:** "Let's not make trouble for some stranger. We have our own problems."

**Note:** This scene demonstrates Astarion's pragmatic self-interest - after 200 years of being exploited, he has no patience for putting himself at risk for strangers. His "we have our own problems" perfectly captures his initial characterization before he learns to care about others. The approval ratings show the moral divide: Gale, Wyll, and Karlach approve heroism while Astarion disapproves.
