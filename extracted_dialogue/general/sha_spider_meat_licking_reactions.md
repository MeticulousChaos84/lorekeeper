When the player decides to lick the suspicious spider meat in Yurgir's lair, companions have various disgusted and incredulous reactions depending on the outcome.

## If the Player Gets Charmed (Passed Roll)

The meat is laced with succubus spittle, causing arousal:

**Gale:** "If what is happening is what I think is happening, and it's because you licked a dead spider - the time might just have come when you and I should split ways."

**Astarion:** "Rotten meat? That's what gets you going? Well, to each their own."

## If the Player Gets Poisoned (Failed Roll)

**Gale:** "You licked a dead spider. Dead spider. You licked it. That is something that happened."

**Gale:** "I think we need to get you some air and perhaps have a long talk about unresolved childhood issues."

**Astarion:** "You are absolutely vile. Gods above."

## If the Player Licks It Again

**Gale:** "Stop licking the damn thing!"

**Astarion:** "Well, that's what you get for being greedy."

**Companion Interjections:**

**Gale:** "You licked a dead spider. Dead spider. You licked it. That is something that happened."

**Gale:** "I think we need to get you some air and perhaps have a long talk about unresolved childhood issues."

**Gale:** "Stop licking the damn thing!"

**Astarion:** "You are absolutely vile. Gods above."

**Astarion:** "Well, that's what you get for being greedy."

**Note:** This scene showcases some of the game's best comedy. Gale's stunned repetition ("Dead spider. You licked it. That is something that happened") shows him trying and failing to process what he just witnessed. His suggestion about "unresolved childhood issues" is peak Gale - even in horror he's analytical. His threat to "split ways" over spider-licking is one of his funniest lines. Astarion's "You are absolutely vile" is particularly funny given he's a vampire who drinks blood - even he has limits. His "to each their own" about the arousal effect shows his typical non-judgmental acceptance of unusual desires, while "what you get for being greedy" blames the player for going back for seconds.
