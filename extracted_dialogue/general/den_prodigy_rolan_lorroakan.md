At the Druid Grove, the player meets Rolan, a tiefling wizard who dreams of apprenticing under Lorroakan in Baldur's Gate. If Gale is in the party, he recognizes the name and shares gossip from Waterdeep.

## Rolan Introduces Himself

**Rolan:** "Other than a desire to avoid impending death? You are looking at Lorroakan's newest apprentice. Yes - that Lorroakan. The greatest wizard in Baldur's Gate."

## Gale's Recognition

**Gale:** "I've heard that name before. A young man, yes? Lives in Ramazith's Tower in the Upper City?"

**Rolan:** "The very same!"

**Gale:** "Word in Waterdeep has it he's a bit of a cad. But you say he's an accomplished wizard?"

**Rolan:** "Of course he is! The greatest spellcaster along the Sword Coast. As if I'd settle for a lesser mentor."

**Gale:** "In that case, I'd very much appreciate it if you could arrange an introduction should we reach the city."

## Player Responses

If the player approves (Gale +1, Wyll +1):

"Good idea: powerful acquaintances never hurt."

**Rolan:** "If it's powerful acquaintances you're after, you have to look no further than yours truly. Few can match me - in either magic or talent."

If the player reminds them of their pressing problem:

**Gale:** "Merely planning ahead. Besides, never hurts to befriend a wizard."

**Rolan:** "In that case, it is I you should befriend."

## Rolan's Parting

**Rolan:** "In years to come, you will boast of this meeting - I can assure you. May we meet again in Baldur's Gate, my friend."

**Companion Interjections:**

**Gale:** "I've heard that name before. A young man, yes? Lives in Ramazith's Tower in the Upper City?"

**Gale:** "Word in Waterdeep has it he's a bit of a cad. But you say he's an accomplished wizard?"

**Gale:** "In that case, I'd very much appreciate it if you could arrange an introduction should we reach the city."

**Gale:** "Merely planning ahead. Besides, never hurts to befriend a wizard."

**Note:** This scene establishes Gale's reputation and network in wizard circles - he's heard gossip about Lorroakan from Waterdeep. It also foreshadows the Act 3 Sorcerous Sundries questline where the player deals with Lorroakan directly. Gale's polite request for an introduction despite knowing Lorroakan is "a bit of a cad" shows his pragmatic approach to wizard politics.
