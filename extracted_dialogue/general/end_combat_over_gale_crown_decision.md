**Starting Node:** Various

After defeating the Netherbrain, Gale stands apart from the group, looking toward the Chionthar where the Crown of Karsus fell.

**Gale:** "The Crown - it's somewhere in the Chionthar."

## Gale's Ambition

**Gale:** "I would be more than the greatest wizard who ever lived - I would be a god."

**Gale:** "The power of Karsus would be in my hands..."

**Gale:** "But what then? What would I do with it, once I have it?"

### If encouraged to pursue godhood:

**Gale:** "Mystra has dictated the terms of my potential for long enough. The Crown would grant me control of my own destiny at last."

**Gale:** "Think of all I could achieve, all that I could grant to those whose ambitions are restrained by Mystra's yoke. I could raise a new Netheril right here in Faerûn."

**Gale:** "That day cannot come soon enough. But first, I must retrieve the Crown."

### If the player expresses doubts:

**Gale:** "I understand. You are right to heed such doubts, however much sadness it brings me to leave you behind."

**Gale:** "Want, need, deserve... Choose whatever word you prefer, but it is what I'm going to do."

**Gale:** "It's I who should be saying such things. Do not think I leave you without a heart as heavy as your own. But I owe it to myself to follow where destiny leads."

### If the player opposes him:

**Gale:** "And I thought you wise enough to recognise that I am not the man I once was."

**Gale:** "It seems that we've come to an impasse. I stand on the threshold of divine ascension, and you would try to keep me grounded."

**Gale:** "It's not your fault - I can hardly expect you to understand. But nor will I relinquish this chance because you are unwilling to imagine a world where I succeed."

### If the player gives sage counsel:

**Gale:** "Sage and timely counsel, as always. And I intend to heed it."

## Companion Reactions to Gale's Ambition

**Astarion (if Vampire Ascendant):** "Such ambition - you make me look positively humble."

**Astarion (if not ascended):** "I can't fault your ambition. I don't know if I'd pick a fight with Mystra myself, but more power to you."

**Minsc:** "Minsc and Boo wish you well, my friend - but think this is perhaps the way into Mystra's bad books, not back into her heart."

**Halsin:** "A lofty goal. Be careful of Mystra - she shall not care to have a new rival."

**Jaheira:** "A humble task ahead, then. And one in which your Mystra will no doubt wish you well."
