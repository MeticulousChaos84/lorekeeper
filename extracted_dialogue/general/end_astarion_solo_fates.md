The morning after defeating the Netherbrain, Avatar Astarion awakens in the Elfsong Tavern, thinking about what comes next. This epilogue has three major branches depending on Astarion's endgame state.

## Path 1: Vampire Ascendant

If Astarion completed the ritual and became a Vampire Lord:

His mind is quiet, free of the parasite, but his body thrums with power - "Power that is now fully unleashed and yours to command."

### Future Options:

**Rule Baldur's Gate:** He pictures the city's politics and power structures - "It would be so easy to bite into it and make it your own." Not as a tyrant with a throne, but ruling quietly from the shadows. "Although... you wouldn't say 'no' to a throne. But not yet. There's no need to rush things after all - you have an eternity to play with. And you're going to have some *fun*."

**Create Vampire Spawn:** With all of Baldur's Gate to choose from, his servants could be the cream of the crop. He considers that his powerful former companions might be "convinced" to join him. "You smile as your mind turns over one possibility after another, each scheme more devious and bloody than the last."

**Purge Companions:** If his companions can destroy the Netherbrain, perhaps they'll think they can destroy him. Depending on their fates:
- If Shadowheart serves Shar: "Perhaps it's best if they were removed from the equation."
- If Wyll is Grand Duke: "Well that's just ridiculous - he'll have to go."
- If Wyll is Blade of Avernus: "Yes, he'll have to go."

"The future is going to be very, very dangerous. And an awful lot of fun."

**Travel the World:** "There's enough out there that it would take a thousand lifetimes to see it all. Thankfully, you may have a thousand lifetimes to spare."

## Path 2: Cazador Still Alive

If Astarion did not defeat Cazador:

His mind is quiet, free from the parasite, but an old tension rises. "Somewhere in this city, your old master is lurking, waiting to reassert his control over you. He might wait days or years, but he will come for you. Your reckoning is inevitable."

### Future Options:

**Rely on Powerful Friends:** "If you've proved nothing else recently, it's that together you can achieve the impossible." The narrator notes advantages from allies like Shar's right hand (Shadowheart), the Grand Duke (Wyll), or the Blade of Avernus (Wyll). "The future seems... well, not 'bright', but certainly not as dark as it could be."

**Become a Vampire Hunter:** "If I can beat a Netherbrain, I can kill one vampire." The narrator muses: "Who knows, you might even make a habit of it? You could see yourself as a famous slayer of vampires - a freer of spawn."

**Hide from Cazador:** "The Sword Coast alone has a hundred places you could disappear, never mind the vast lands to the east. There's an almost endless world for you to explore. Even if you can only see it at night."

**Seek Help from the Gur:** If they're alive and gave the quest, he considers it, but realizes: "No. No, you doubt they'll want to do you any favours."

"There will be dangers aplenty, of course, but what's life without a little danger?"

## Path 3: Cazador Dead, No Ascension

If Astarion killed Cazador but didn't complete the ritual:

His mind is quiet, free from both the parasite and Cazador. "You're not sure you've ever known peace like it. But like everything, there was a cost."

"You can feel it in the pit of your stomach - the knowledge you'll never feel the warm sun on your skin again. Still, you *are* free. Your future is finally your own."

### Future Options:

**Continue Being a Hero:** "Astarion - Hero of Baldur's Gate. You rather like the sound of that." The narrator warns of a life facing "every beast, fiend, and lunatic out there, all while dodging assassination attempts, plots, and intrigue. Your life will be nothing but one night of peril after another - a bloody cascade of violence that will leave a trail of bodies everywhere you go."

"'Yes,' you think to yourself. 'This is going to be *fun*.'"

**Lead the Spawn in the Underdark:** If he freed the prisoners: "You think of the thousands of souls waiting in the Underdark. Lost, leaderless... You led so many of them into the dark. Who's to say you're not the one to lead them back to the light?"

**Search for a Way to Walk in Sunlight:** "Being able to walk into the sun is a nice idea, but clearly impossible. Then again, you've done the impossible half a dozen times recently. Who's to say you don't have one last miracle left in you?"

**Travel the World:** "All these years alive and you have spent almost all of them trapped in the same wretched palace. Yes, you'd rather like to see what else the world has to offer. You'll have to see it after dark, of course - when murder, theft, and all manner of lust and debauchery rule the night. But of course, you wouldn't have it any other way."

**Companion Interjections:**

None - this is entirely internal monologue from Astarion's perspective as the player character.
