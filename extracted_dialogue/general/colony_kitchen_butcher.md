# Colony Kitchen - Chop the Butcher

In the Colony kitchen, the player encounters Chop - a butcher whose mind has been hollowed out to better serve the collective.

The narrator describes: "No will sparks behind his eyes. His mind has been hollowed out, to better echo the commands of the collective."

**Lae'zel:** "A *ghaik* thrall. The only way to save it is to kill it."

## Reading Chop's Mind

Using psionic powers to enter his thoughts reveals: "Pliant as well-worn boots, his mind turns to his work. Chop. Cut. Sort. Shiver of impact. Crack of bone. He removes the brains, digs free the squirming tadpoles. The unworthy ones, given over to the illithids. To become."

When asked what they become:

Chop: "Part of One Mind. Four little feet. Dancing. To same song."

The narrator reveals: "With a lurch, you realise he means the intellect devourers. Here the brains are harvested - made part of the hivemind."

## Us the Intellect Devourer

If the player saved Us from the Nautiloid, Chop mentions: "But there is one. Little. Kitty. Dances. To another song. Same. Song. As you?"

He calls Us a "bad kitty" that sings the wrong song and must be fixed.

The player can convince Chop to release Us through:
- Psionic persuasion (DC 14 Wisdom): "Let it come with me. We sing the same song."
- Regular persuasion (DC 14): "I'll take the creature with me. It won't disrupt the hivemind anymore."
- Intimidation (DC 18): "Free the creature or I'll kill you and every one of your creations."

On success, Chop gives the key and warns: "Careful petting. Sticky."

On failure, he attacks: "No. No. Wrong song. OTHER. WRONG SONG!"

## Finding Ketheric

If asked about Ketheric, Chop becomes momentarily lucid with fear: "Down. Deep. One of Three. *One of Three*."

## Mercy Kill

When threatened to join the creatures he butchered, Chop responds with desperate longing: "... Yes. Yes. *Please.*"
