# Forest - The Thayanthe Cellar Magic Mirror

**Starting Node:** 138

---

In the Blighted Village, the player finds a talking magic mirror guarding the entrance to a Thayan wizard's secret room. The mirror asks three questions to determine if the visitor is friend or foe. Origin characters have unique responses.

## The Mirror's Challenge

The mirror speaks in a cracked, broken voice: "Spea-k your name."

The player must prove they are an ally of Ilyn Toth, the mirror's dead master.

If playing as a Wizard (not Gale):

*A magic mirror! You've read all about them, but never seen one up close before.*

## First Question: Szass Tam

The mirror asks: "What th-ink you of the zulkir known as Szass Tam?"

Narrator (if pass History check): *You remember reading a history of Thay. Szass Tam is a powerful lich who rules that land and drove out the Red Wizards that opposed him.*

Correct answer: "A foul lich. May he die a thousand more deaths."

## Second Question: Balsam Ointment

The mirror asks: "T-tell me, why might one use balsam ointment?"

Gale origin option: "Balsam disinfects wounds. Surely everyone knows that?"

Correct answer: "To clean a wound?"

## Third Question: Mirror Vision

The mirror asks: "...if you could see an-ything in me, what w-ould it be?"

### Origin-Specific Responses

**Astarion Options:**
- "I'd see my home. My *real* home - the one I haven't seen in centuries."
- "I'd see how to safely keep the powers this mind flayer's worm has given me."
- "I'd see Cazador, my old master, burning in the sun."

**Gale Options:**
- "I'd see a wizard tower. A safe haven for me and a sweetheart - forever."
- "I'd see myself in my next incarnation: a living manifestation of Netherese magic. A mythal in my own right."
- "I'd see my rivals humbled - jealous of my mastery of the Weave."

**Other Origins:**
- Karlach: "I'd see my folks in our house in the Outer City. Mince pies on the window sill. Perfect." / "I'd see the Hells filled in with flowers, and my old boss Gortash on his hands and knees tending them for eternity."
- Lae'zel: "I'd gaze upon Vlaakith in the grand city of Tu'narath."
- Shadowheart: "I have no memory of my parents - I'd like to see them, at least once."
- Wyll: "I would see my father - his arms extended in forgiveness."

The "correct" answers that satisfy the mirror include the power-focused options like seeing enemies humbled or destroyed. The loving/nostalgic answers ("I'd see the ones I love") are rejected as "Weak."

## Mirror Responses

If the player fails: "A lie. An in-truder!" (activates trap)

If player claims to be invisible: Roll Deception vs 10

If player is short (Dwarf/Gnome/Halfling): "My master stands t-all and proud. You are not Ilyn Toth."

If player is Underdark race: "I see you were shaped by d-arkness, not light. You are not Ilyn Toth."

**Origin Character Interjections:**

Astarion (as player origin):
- "I'd see my home. My *real* home - the one I haven't seen in centuries."
- "I'd see how to safely keep the powers this mind flayer's worm has given me."
- "I'd see Cazador, my old master, burning in the sun."

Gale (as player origin):
- "Balsam disinfects wounds. Surely everyone knows that?"
- "I'd see a wizard tower. A safe haven for me and a sweetheart - forever."
- "I'd see myself in my next incarnation: a living manifestation of Netherese magic. A mythal in my own right."
- "I'd see my rivals humbled - jealous of my mastery of the Weave."

**Note:** This dialogue reveals deep character insights through the mirror's question about what they'd most want to see. Astarion's options show his longing for his lost mortal life, desire to keep his powers, and hatred of Cazador. Gale's options show his romantic dreams, ambition to transcend mortality as a Netherese mythal, and competitive nature with rival wizards.
