When finding the Necromancy of Thay in the cellar beneath the Blighted Village, companions react to the player's handling of the dangerous tome.

## Gale's Concern for Books

If the player mistreats the book:

**Gale:** "What are you doing? That's no way to treat a book!"

## Astarion's Eagerness

When receiving the book to open:

**Astarion:** "Excellent."

---

**Companion Interjections:**

**Gale:** "What are you doing? That's no way to treat a book!"

**Astarion:** "Excellent."

---

**Note:** These brief reactions perfectly contrast the two characters. Gale's immediate concern is for proper book handling - even a dangerous necromantic tome deserves respect as a text. Astarion's simple "Excellent" when given the book reveals his eagerness to dabble with dark magic, showing none of Gale's scholarly caution or respect for the tome's danger.
