In the Shadow Cursed Lands, Raphael offers to translate Astarion's scars in exchange for killing his escaped servant, the Orthon Yurgir. Astarion negotiates and reacts to the deal.

## Astarion's Reactions to the Deal

**Astarion:** "A fairer deal than I expected."

When the player declines:

**Astarion:** "Let's not be so hasty - we might enjoy doing the devil's dirty work."

**Astarion:** "And it's all for a good cause - me."

When accepting the deal:

**Astarion:** "Yes, fine, we'll kill this damn creature of yours."

**Astarion:** "What's not to like? We kill some horrible beastie, and I get what I want in return. Everyone's happy."

**Astarion:** "Except the beastie."

When approaching Raphael about the scars:

**Astarion:** "This is serious business, devil."

## The Scars Revealed

When Raphael magicks away his shirt:

**Astarion:** "Gods damn it."

After the scars are examined:

**Astarion:** "Well. Now you know."

## Explaining to the Player

If the player is upset Astarion kept secrets:

**Astarion:** "I - perhaps I should have, but I'm not used to asking for help and being met with, well... help."

**Astarion:** "But what's done is done, so how about we stop discussing it and just kill this beast?"

About the torture:

**Astarion:** "Cazador worked on it from dusk until dawn, all with an ancient blade he called his 'needle'. Cutting and tearing, starting over if I screamed or winced too much."

**Astarion:** "It was a rough night."

## Moving Forward

**Astarion:** "It could be infinitely worse. We seem to be rather good at killing things."

**Astarion:** "Let's just go. Standing here chatting gets us nowhere."

**Astarion:** "Although I should probably get dressed first..."
