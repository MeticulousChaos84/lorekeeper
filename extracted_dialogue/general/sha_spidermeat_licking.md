In the Shadow Cursed Lands, the player finds a hunk of rotting spider meat. They can choose to lick it, prompting disgusted reactions from companions.

## First Lick

One companion (randomly selected) reacts:

**Astarion:** "You are absolutely vile. Gods above."

**Gale:** "You licked a dead spider. Dead spider. You licked it. That is something that happened."

**Gale:** "I think we need to get you some air and perhaps have a long talk about unresolved childhood issues."

Other companions' versions:
- Wyll: "What is it they say? Ah yes - 'Curiosity killed the kobold.'"
- Karlach: "Haha! Go on, give us a turn next."

## Second Lick (Gets Poisoned)

If the player licks it again, they get poisoned:

**Approval:** Karlach +1, everyone else -1

**Astarion:** "Well, that's what you get for being greedy."

**Gale:** "Stop licking the damn thing!"

Other companions' versions:
- Wyll: "Bad luck. Let's call this... a learning moment."
- Shadowheart: "Honestly, what did you think was going to happen? You'd develop a taste for it?"
- Karlach: "All right there, mate? Yeah, you're all right."

**Companion Interjections:**

**Astarion:** "You are absolutely vile. Gods above."

**Astarion:** "Well, that's what you get for being greedy."

**Gale:** "You licked a dead spider. Dead spider. You licked it. That is something that happened."

**Gale:** "I think we need to get you some air and perhaps have a long talk about unresolved childhood issues."

**Gale:** "Stop licking the damn thing!"

**Note:** This comedic scene showcases both characters' personalities. Astarion is disgusted (despite being a vampire who drinks blood) and smugly tells the player "that's what you get for being greedy." Gale's stunned repetition "Dead spider. You licked it. That is something that happened" and suggestion of therapy shows his scholarly brain struggling to process pure chaos.
