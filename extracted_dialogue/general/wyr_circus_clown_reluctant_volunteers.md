When Dribbles the Clown demands a volunteer for his performance, the player can volunteer companions against their will. The reactions are priceless.

## Volunteering Astarion

When the player tells Astarion he loves the spotlight:

**Astarion:** "What? No. Don't you dare. This isn't funny."

If the player insists with "Go on, Astarion!":

**Astarion:** "Of course, what fun! *I'm going to fucking kill you.*"

## Volunteering Gale

When the player tells Gale he's "good at tricks":

**Gale:** "Truly? I might as well go mount the gallows."

If the player insists with "Go on, Gale!":

**Gale:** "You truly are testing the patience of a man who could level a city if he wished, you know."

**Companion Interjections:**

**Astarion:** "What? No. Don't you dare. This isn't funny."

**Astarion:** "Of course, what fun! *I'm going to fucking kill you.*"

**Gale:** "Truly? I might as well go mount the gallows."

**Gale:** "You truly are testing the patience of a man who could level a city if he wished, you know."

**Note:** This scene is pure comedy gold. Every other companion gains approval (+1) when Astarion or Gale is forced to perform, showing they're all enjoying the spectacle. Astarion's reaction shifts from desperate pleading ("Don't you dare") to cheerful death threat ("I'm going to fucking kill you") with perfect comedic timing - the italics show he's smiling for the audience while promising murder to the player. Gale compares performing with a clown to execution ("mount the gallows") and casually reminds everyone he could destroy a city if sufficiently annoyed. Both reactions show these characters do NOT do undignified public performances - and everyone knows it.
