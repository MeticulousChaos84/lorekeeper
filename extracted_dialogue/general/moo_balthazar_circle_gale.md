In Balthazar's laboratory at Moonrise Towers, Gale examines a magic circle used to create Moonlanterns, offering to neutralize the Shadow Weave within it.

## Gale's Analysis

When examining the circle:

**Gale:** "The sigils are written in a curious mix of tongues - ancient Calishite, Netherese, and something else I can't quite make out. If I'm reading it correctly - it was used in the creation of Moonlanterns."

**Gale:** "It's been mostly drained, but even now contains a powerful dose of Shadow Weave."

When asked if it's safe:

**Gale:** "It's inert, if that's what you mean. But it still reeks of the Shadow Weave, and its polluting magic will continue to escape for as long as it lies abandoned here."

## Offering to Help

**Gale:** "Or did you wish to use it? I assure you - it's pointless. You'll have nothing more than a sore head and a very dissatisfied wizard to show for it."

## If the Player Refuses His Help

**Gale:** "Oh, charming. I hope the Shadow Weave was to blame for that little outburst of unwarranted discourtesy."

**Gale:** "If you think you know best, go right ahead."

**Gale:** "Gods, you're obstinate."

## Neutralizing the Circle

**Gale:** "Very well. Stand back, if you please."

**Note:** This scene showcases Gale's scholarly expertise and wounded pride. His recognition of "ancient Calishite, Netherese" demonstrates his deep magical knowledge. When refused, his snippy "unwarranted discourtesy" and "Gods, you're obstinate" show his bruised ego - he genuinely believes he knows best about magic. His warning about "a very dissatisfied wizard" reveals his dry humor even when annoyed.
