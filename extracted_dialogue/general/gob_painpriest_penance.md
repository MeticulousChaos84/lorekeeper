In the Goblin Camp, the player can undergo Abdirak's penance ritual - being whipped in service to Loviatar. Astarion has unique reactions to this scene.

## Shadowheart and Astarion Exchange

If both companions are present, Shadowheart asks:

**Shadowheart:** "Would you have joined up with them if you'd known they'd be indulging in this sort of thing, Astarion?"

**Astarion:** "I mean, I had my hopes."

## Astarion's Solo Reaction

When watching the player get whipped:

**Astarion:** "Oh, bravo! Encore!"

*Stage direction: Clapping, thrilled to see your companion take a lash from a whip.*

**Companion Interjections:**

**Astarion:** "I mean, I had my hopes."

**Astarion:** "Oh, bravo! Encore!"

**Note:** This scene reveals Astarion's complex relationship with pain and pleasure. His "I had my hopes" suggests he finds the player's willingness to be whipped attractive. His theatrical "Encore!" while clapping shows he genuinely enjoys watching, though whether this reflects sadism or his own traumatic history with Cazador's abuse is ambiguous.
