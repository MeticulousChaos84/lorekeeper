In Cazador's palace, Astarion discovers the Gur children he kidnapped years ago - now turned into vampire spawn and locked in cells. This is a pivotal character moment where Astarion confronts his past.

## Astarion Recognizes Them

When Astarion sees the children:

**Astarion:** "Oh Gods, it can't be..."

## Confessing to the Crime

When confronted about kidnapping them:

**Astarion:** "Ah. Ah-hah... yes, now that you mention it, I may have done... that."

**Astarion:** "Don't look at me like that - Cazador's orders."

**Astarion:** "Quite the deviation from my usual routine, of course. Capture, not lure. I didn't bring them in with sweetrolls or anything."

**Astarion:** "I really forgot about them, felt nothing the moment I handed them over to him."

## Reacting to Their Accusations

When the children accuse him:

**Astarion:** "I was in the prime of my life when I was turned."

**Astarion:** "Everything was taken from *me*, too."

## Guilt and Shame

**Astarion:** "Of course I deserve it, but the countless others they'd feed from..."

**Astarion:** "I just... I never want to see these little scraps of misery again. The world doesn't need to know my shame."

**Astarion:** "All these people were ruined because of me."

When asked if they still have hope:

**Astarion:** "Enough to break your heart."

**Astarion:** "Maybe I am. Maybe that's what I have to do."

## Practical Advice

**Astarion:** "Might I recommend acquiring a taste for rats? They won't sate your appetite, but they help with the hunger."

## Other Reactions

If the player is blunt with the children:

**Astarion:** "I couldn't have put it less delicately if I'd tried."

Commenting on their hunger:

**Astarion:** "Thirsty little brats, aren't they?"

About their fate:

**Astarion:** "I suppose there's a good chance they will."

**Astarion:** "What use is it, though? They're lost, ravenous, feral. They'd attack any mortal on sight."

If things go poorly:

**Astarion:** "Well that could have gone better."

## Denial Options

If Astarion tries to deny involvement:

**Astarion:** "I don't know what you mean. I've never seen these children in my life."

If the player tries to defend him:

**Astarion:** "How chivalrous of you. As if I need defending from these *children*."
