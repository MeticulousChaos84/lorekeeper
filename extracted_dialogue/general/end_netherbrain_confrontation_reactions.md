During the final confrontation with the Netherbrain at the Morphic Pool, companions react to key moments in the battle.

## When Gortash's Mind Is Destroyed

When the Netherbrain obliterates Gortash's mind:

**Astarion:** "Sweet hells! Well, that's what you get."

**Gale:** "Hells. His mind crumpled like a piece of parchment."

## When the Player Surrenders to the Brain

If the player chooses to submit to the Netherbrain's control:

**Gale:** "What in the hells are you doing?"

**Astarion:** "No - what are you doing? Fight, damn you!"

## Urgent Battle Cries

When the battle reaches a critical point:

**Astarion:** "We have to stop it - it's now or never!"

**Gale:** "We can't afford to let that happen."

**Companion Interjections:**

**Astarion:** "Sweet hells! Well, that's what you get."

**Astarion:** "No - what are you doing? Fight, damn you!"

**Astarion:** "We have to stop it - it's now or never!"

**Gale:** "Hells. His mind crumpled like a piece of parchment."

**Gale:** "What in the hells are you doing?"

**Gale:** "We can't afford to let that happen."

**Note:** These reactions during the final battle show interesting character perspectives. Astarion's "Well, that's what you get" about Gortash shows satisfaction at seeing the schemer get his comeuppance, while Gale's "crumpled like a piece of parchment" is a typically analytical wizard observation even in the heat of battle. When the player considers surrendering, Astarion's "Fight, damn you!" is particularly intense - after 200 years under Cazador's control, watching someone choose to be mind-controlled is unbearable to him. Gale maintains his characteristic composure even while horrified.
