At the summit of the Netherbrain, Gale faces the ultimate decision: use the Crown of Karsus to become a god, or sacrifice himself with the orb to end the threat immediately.

## Path 1: Gale Pursuing the Crown

If Gale was encouraged to seek the Crown:

**Gale:** "Can't you feel it? We're almost there."

**Gale:** "Once we ascend the Netherbrain's stem, we'll be in touching distance of the crown. Of reclaiming the powers of Karsus himself."

**Gale:** "I'm ready. Are you?"

### If the player suggests using the orb instead:

**Gale:** "And I would die in the process, just to win the favour of a goddess who scarcely cares for me. We discussed this at length - I thought you and I were of a similar mind."

If the player insists on the orb (DC 30 Persuasion):

On success, Gale admits:

**Gale:** "I could simply tell you what you want to hear, then ascend by myself and seize the Crown anyway, you know."

If the player says they trust him not to:

**Gale:** "Sometimes I wish I were a more selfish man. Life would be so much easier. But alas..."

**Gale:** "You're right. The orb is the only way. All that's left for me to do is spirit you away to safety. Are you ready?"

On failure:

**Gale:** "I thought I meant more to you than a sacrificial lamb. Clearly I was mistaken. I will not cast everything away, not when I know what's out there, almost within my grasp."

**Gale:** "If the fight should turn against us, and we have no other option, then rest assured I shall unleash the orb. But I believe there is a much grander destiny in store for us."

### If the player questions the Crown's danger:

**Gale:** "You urged me to this point, and now you falter? What would you have me do, sacrifice myself and hope that Mystra eulogises my ashes?"

If persuaded to destroy the Crown (DC 30):

**Gale:** "If you're wrong, we'll have squandered the chance for a better world. You understand that, don't you?"

**Gale:** "But... perhaps saving the day will suffice for now. A better world can always follow, so long as we survive."

**Gale:** "So be it - lead on."

### If the player supports the Crown:

**Gale:** "Your fears are misplaced - the Crown will lead to a better world for all. I cannot ignore that."

**Gale:** "Then I think it's about time we ascended, don't you?"

## Path 2: Gale Willing to Use the Orb

If Gale agreed to sacrifice himself:

**Gale:** "I can end this now - stop the Absolute, and spare the city. The stage is set for my final act. Mystra's bidding. And the redemption that lies beyond."

### If the player tries to stop him:

**Gale:** "What's the alternative? I allow the Absolute to have its way? Die in vain along with all its victims? Or flee, and live on in shame?"

**Gale:** "It's just a choice between two deaths. Quick and meaningful, or torturous and pointless."

**Gale:** "I'm sure such an outcome is possible, but why risk it? If we ascend there, and try to fight the good fight... well, there're no guarantees."

**Gale:** "But this way, we'll know the matter is done, and we'll know exactly what it shall cost - me, and me alone."

**Gale:** "It's now, or never."

### Convincing Gale not to sacrifice himself:

**Gale:** "Always another way, yes - but not necessarily a *better* way."

**Gale:** "This isn't giving up - it's securing victory, at a price I am willing to pay. And everything we shared can live on - with you."

If the player wants to stay with him:

**Gale:** "You'd be dying in vain. I don't need company to sacrifice myself."

**Gale:** "Please. For too long I've lived in fear of taking a host of innocents with me when I expired. Now at least I can be assured my demise will be *saving* them instead."

If persuaded to fight instead:

**Gale:** "If you're mistaken, this could be the end of everything. We will be failing, right at the last hurdle."

**Gale:** "But... I only made it this far thanks to you. Who am I to question such sterling guidance now?"

**Gale:** "Lead on, then. I shall stay my hand as long as I can - but if the tide of battle turns against us, remember I have the means to bring a swift end to this."

### If the player insists on staying by his side:

To romantic partner:
**Gale:** "Please... this will be so much easier knowing that my memory lives on with you."

To non-romantic partner:
**Gale:** "No. Let me do this on my terms. Besides - I need someone left to sing my praises, after I'm gone."

### The farewell:

**Gale:** "There's endless wonder out there. Infinite possibilities. Perhaps fate will bring us back together, before the universe dims."
