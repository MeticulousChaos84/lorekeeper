At the Circus of the Last Days, the clown Buddy needs a volunteer for his act. The player can "volunteer" their companions, who react with varying degrees of reluctance and threat.

## Sending Astarion

If the player says "You love the spotlight, don't you, Astarion? Here's your big chance":

**Approval:** Everyone else +1 (Minsc +2), Astarion -1

**Astarion:** "What? No. Don't you dare. This isn't funny."

If the player encourages "Go on, Astarion!":

**Astarion:** "Of course, what fun! *I'm going to fucking kill you.*"

## Sending Gale

If the player says "Gale, you're good at tricks, right? Up you go":

**Approval:** Everyone else +1

**Gale:** "Truly? I might as well go mount the gallows."

If the player encourages "Go on, Gale!":

**Approval:** Everyone else +1, Gale -1

**Gale:** "You truly are testing the patience of a man who could level a city if he wished, you know."

**Companion Interjections:**

**Astarion:** "What? No. Don't you dare. This isn't funny."

**Astarion:** "Of course, what fun! *I'm going to fucking kill you.*"

**Gale:** "Truly? I might as well go mount the gallows."

**Gale:** "You truly are testing the patience of a man who could level a city if he wished, you know."

**Note:** This comedic scene shows both characters' personalities perfectly. Astarion hates being embarrassed and makes death threats when pushed. Gale's line about leveling a city is an ominous reference to the Netherese orb in his chest - he's genuinely threatening to explode if the player keeps annoying him. Both are reluctant, but Gale's threat is actually backed by apocalyptic power.
