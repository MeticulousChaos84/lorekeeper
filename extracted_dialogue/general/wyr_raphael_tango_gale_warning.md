When Raphael approaches the party with his grand offer - the Orphic Hammer in exchange for the Crown of Karsus - Gale urgently warns against accepting.

## Gale's Urgent Warning

If Gale knows about the Crown:

**Gale:** "The Crown of Karsus cannot be handed over to this devil. *Agree to nothing.*"

If Gale doesn't yet know about the Crown:

**Gale:** "Handing that crown to this devil would be like feeding gunpowder to a lava worm. Agree to *nothing*."

**Companion Interjections:**

**Gale:** "The Crown of Karsus cannot be handed over to this devil. *Agree to nothing.*"

**Gale:** "Handing that crown to this devil would be like feeding gunpowder to a lava worm. Agree to *nothing*."

**Note:** Gale's emphatic warnings reveal his deep understanding of what's at stake. The Crown of Karsus is the most powerful magical artifact in existence - in the wrong hands it could remake reality. His colorful metaphor ("gunpowder to a lava worm") shows both his wit and his genuine alarm. As a wizard who once touched forbidden power himself, Gale knows the catastrophic consequences of giving such artifacts to those who crave power. His repeated "Agree to *nothing*" is unusually forceful for the typically diplomatic Gale.
