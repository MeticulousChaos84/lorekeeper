In the Goblin Camp, the player can interact with Crusher, a drunk goblin who demands the player kiss his foot. Companions have amusing reactions to the various ways this can be resolved.

## Companion Reactions to Sleight of Tongue

After the player successfully steals the ring with their tongue:

**Astarion:** "No? I want to hear every sordid detail."

**Gale:** "Well! I've never seen sleight of tongue quite like that before."

## Companion Reactions to Non-Violent Solutions

When Lae'zel disapproves:

**Astarion:** "Oh don't be like that. Not every problem has to be beaten to death, my dear."

## Reactions to Toe Removal

After the player convinces Crusher to bite off his own toe:

**Astarion:** "Not bad. I would've taken the whole toe, but whatever works for you."

## Encouraging the Player

When the player is about to kiss the foot:

**Astarion:** "Well? Go on, give him a nibble."

**Gale:** "I feel I should warn you that the average goblin foot is host to some two dozen toe-curling diseases."

**Companion Interjections:**

**Astarion:** "No? I want to hear every sordid detail."

**Astarion:** "Oh don't be like that. Not every problem has to be beaten to death, my dear."

**Astarion:** "Not bad. I would've taken the whole toe, but whatever works for you."

**Astarion:** "Well? Go on, give him a nibble."

**Gale:** "Well! I've never seen sleight of tongue quite like that before."

**Gale:** "I feel I should warn you that the average goblin foot is host to some two dozen toe-curling diseases."

**Note:** This comedic scene showcases the contrast between Gale and Astarion. Gale provides hilariously specific medical warnings ("two dozen toe-curling diseases"), while Astarion encourages the debauchery and wants "every sordid detail." His line "Not every problem has to be beaten to death" shows his preference for clever solutions over violence - unusual for a companion. The "whole toe" comment reveals his casual sadism.
