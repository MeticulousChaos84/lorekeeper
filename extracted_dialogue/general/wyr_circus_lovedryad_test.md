At the Circus of the Last Days, Zethino the dryad runs a "Test Your Love" game where she asks questions about your romanced companion to see how well you know them. Both Astarion and Gale have extensive reactions.

## Astarion's Reactions

### About His Happiness

If the player says Astarion has never been happy:

**Astarion:** "Excuse me? I've been happy, thank you very much."

If the player says he's happiest when killing:

**Astarion:** "Guilty as charged. Sometimes literally..."

### About Revenge

If the player correctly identifies that Astarion wants revenge:

**Astarion:** "Oh yes. Yes please."

### About Privacy

When the player answers personal questions:

**Astarion:** "You're not wrong, but do we need to tell every stranger we meet our business?"

**Astarion:** "Really? I mean, yes, but - really? You'd tell whatever stranger just walked up and asked?"

### About His Appearance

If the player mentions his good looks:

**Astarion:** "Ha! Well, when you look this good..."

### When Answers Go Wrong

If the player gets answers wrong:

**Astarion:** "It's a grimace, sweetie. Not off to a great start."

**Astarion:** "Well, that was a disaster. Can we call time on this farce? Please?"

If the player picks a pleasing-but-wrong answer:

**Astarion:** "Oh I like that answer. Yes, let's go with that."

## Gale's Reactions

### About His Pride

If the player mentions his vanity:

**Gale:** "You make me sound like some preening peacock. I am not *that* bad."

### About Waterdeep

If the player correctly identifies his mind wanders to Waterdeep:

**Gale:** "Bravo. That is indeed where my mind wanders to, when times are hard..."

### About Mystra

If the player mentions Mystra:

**Gale:** "Once, perhaps. But those passions have soured."

### About His Failings

**Gale:** "I have worse failings, I fear. Far worse."

### About His Fate

If the player mentions his destiny as a sacrifice:

**Gale:** "Hearing it said out loud - yes, I fear it is true. Fate seems determined to make a sacrifice of me."

**Gale:** "But perhaps fate can yet be defied..."

### About Metaphors

**Gale:** "An apt metaphor - though I hope it won't lose me some kisses."

**Astarion:** "You're not wrong, but do we need to tell every stranger we meet our business?"

**Astarion:** "Ha! Well, when you look this good..."

**Astarion:** "Well, that was a disaster. Can we call time on this farce? Please?"

**Note:** This scene reveals deep character truths. Astarion's reactions show his sensitivity about happiness (he's defensive about never being happy), his admission that he enjoys killing, and his discomfort with intimacy being public. Gale's reactions reveal his homesickness for Waterdeep, his soured feelings toward Mystra, and his fear that fate has marked him for sacrifice - but also his hope that fate can be defied.
