At the final moment before commanding the Netherbrain, Astarion (if he became a Vampire Lord) can tempt the player to seize control of the Absolute and rule the world together.

## Astarion (Vampire Lord) Encouraging Evil

### If Romanced

**Astarion:** "It can be ours, my love. The whole world - we only have to take it."

### If Dark Urge Partner

**Astarion:** "I know what you're thinking. So let's do it. Let's seize the whole damn world and be reviled together."

### General

**Astarion:** "We could do it, you know. We could rule the world."

## Astarion Origin - Facing Loss

If playing as Astarion:

**Narrator:** "*You glimpse a future where you lose all the gifts the parasite gave you - a future where you no longer see the sun.*"

**Companion Interjections:**

**Astarion:** "It can be ours, my love. The whole world - we only have to take it."

**Astarion:** "I know what you're thinking. So let's do it. Let's seize the whole damn world and be reviled together."

**Astarion:** "We could do it, you know. We could rule the world."

**Note:** These lines only appear if Astarion ascended to Vampire Lord status - if he stayed a spawn, he doesn't encourage domination. The Vampire Lord path represents Astarion choosing power over growth, and here he reveals its logical conclusion: absolute power over the world. His phrase "be reviled together" shows he expects they'll be hated but doesn't care. The contrast between this and spawn Astarion (who just wants to live freely) perfectly illustrates the game's exploration of how trauma can lead to either healing or becoming what hurt you.
