When Nettie asks companions to leave during her examination of the player's tadpole condition, they have different reactions.

## Declining to Leave

When Nettie requests privacy:

**Astarion:** "Please, don't mind me. I'll just watch."

**Gale:** "I'm interested in the procedure, actually. Please, go ahead."

**Companion Interjections:**

**Astarion:** "Please, don't mind me. I'll just watch."

**Gale:** "I'm interested in the procedure, actually. Please, go ahead."

**Note:** These brief reactions perfectly capture each character's approach to medical situations. Astarion's "don't mind me, I'll just watch" has an almost voyeuristic quality - given his nature as a vampire who has spent centuries observing victims, it's both characteristic and slightly unnerving. Gale's response is pure academic curiosity - he's genuinely interested in the medical procedure and wants to learn. Both refuse to leave, but for very different reasons: Astarion out of a predatory watchfulness, Gale out of scholarly interest.
