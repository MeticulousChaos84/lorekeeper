When the party speaks with Zevlor about the tiefling refugees' situation and whether to help broker peace with the druids, companions offer contrasting perspectives.

## Astarion's Cynicism

When asked to deliver messages:

**Astarion:** "Really? We're messengers, now?"

When the player refuses to help:

**Astarion:** "Turning your back on those in need? Maybe we'll get along after all."

## Gale's Diplomacy

When considering helping:

**Gale:** "I think you should, yes. No harm in trying the diplomatic route."

**Gale:** "We've our problems, granted, but there might be some merit in shutting down a local conflict, no?"

**Companion Interjections:**

**Astarion:** "Really? We're messengers, now?"

**Astarion:** "Turning your back on those in need? Maybe we'll get along after all."

**Gale:** "I think you should, yes. No harm in trying the diplomatic route."

**Gale:** "We've our problems, granted, but there might be some merit in shutting down a local conflict, no?"

**Note:** This scene perfectly illustrates the contrast between Astarion and Gale's worldviews. Astarion's "Maybe we'll get along after all" when the player refuses to help reveals his approval of selfishness - he sees looking out for oneself as sensible. Gale, meanwhile, advocates for diplomacy and helping others even amid their own crisis. His practical framing ("shutting down a local conflict") shows he's not purely altruistic but sees tactical value in being helpful.
