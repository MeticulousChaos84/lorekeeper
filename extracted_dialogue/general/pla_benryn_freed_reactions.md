After freeing Benryn from the burning ruins of Waukeen's Rest, companions react to the player's choices about helping him.

## Astarion's Dark Humor

When the player takes money instead of helping:

**Astarion:** "You took the gold? I was rather hoping for the body..."

## Gale Apologizing for Other Companions

Gale automatically apologizes when other companions are rude:

**Gale:** "Allow me to apologise on Astarion's behalf, sir. His lack of tact is a burden to us all."

**Gale:** "Allow me to apologise on Lae'zel's behalf, sir. Her lack of tact is a burden to us all."

**Gale:** "Allow me to apologise on Shadowheart's behalf, sir. Her lack of tact is a burden to us all."

## Reactions to Selfish Choices

When the player refuses to return his wife's ring:

**Gale:** "That was a rather unimpressive display of pettiness, if you ask me."

**Companion Interjections:**

**Astarion:** "You took the gold? I was rather hoping for the body..."

**Gale:** "Allow me to apologise on Astarion's behalf, sir. His lack of tact is a burden to us all."

**Gale:** "That was a rather unimpressive display of pettiness, if you ask me."

**Note:** Astarion's "hoping for the body" is darkly hilarious - even in a tragic moment, he's thinking about feeding. Meanwhile, Gale's consistent apologizing for other companions shows his social awareness and desire to maintain civilized interactions even when traveling with rude warriors and secretive clerics. His calling out "unimpressive display of pettiness" is unusually harsh for Gale, suggesting he has limits to his tolerance.
