# Githzerai Brain - Colony Memory Vault

---

In the Colony's Memory Library vault, the player inserts a brain jar into the Brain Reading Device and encounters a Slack-Skinned Head - a preserved githzerai monk whose brain has been kept alive for centuries.

The head tests its new flesh-prison, remarking on "fine bones, sharp jaw" and noting it's "pretty enough" though not as noble as her original githzerai features.

## Learning About Githzerai

A passive History check (DC 18) reveals: The monk-like githzerai are sibling-race to the warrior githyanki. Their contempt for one another is eclipsed only by their shared hatred of the illithids.

If the player is githyanki, the narrator notes the githzerai are the only beings the githyanki hate more than the illithids.

## The Offer

The githzerai proposes mutual aid, guessing the player is also an unwilling guest of the "ghaik" (illithid term).

If the player is githyanki and mocks her:

She retorts that a githyanki skull would be too tight - "Your people shunned psionics, after all - while mine mastered them."

She explains her order taught a psionic technique much-feared by the illithids. They destroyed her monastery and kept her as a trophy. But despite centuries of captivity, she never broke - she's been awake and aware the whole time.

Her offer: Use your tadpole to erase her mind, and she will pass her psionic technique to you.

## The Truth (DC 18 Insight or Warlock Patron Warning)

If the player passes a Wisdom/Insight check or receives a warning from their Warlock patron, they realize she's lying.

If pressed for truth, she breaks down:

"I led them there. They promised me immortality. And they gave it - I have been their rotting trophy for centuries."

The narrator reveals that as her agitation swells, so does her latent psionic power. Her guilt and terror are "almost fragrant" to the tadpole. The illithids locked her away not as a trophy, but as a "fine vintage."

She begs: "Please - touch my mind, and purge it. The moment you do, my knowledge will be yours."

## The Choice

**Consume her mind:** The player uses their tadpole to devour her consciousness. She screams "No. NO. PLEASE!" as her mind is erased. The player receives the psionic technique.

**Purge her mind:** A merciful erasure. Her awareness floods the player - "tentative, and tinged with the loneliness of aeons." It fades beneath the player's touch, leaving a fragment of knowledge. She whispers "And I... I see..." as consciousness fades.

**Leave:** She desperately cries "PLEASE!" as the player walks away.

**No tadpole:** If the player has no psionic power, she says it's "a terrible fate, to be born without a high-mind" and asks them to return with someone who bears this gift.

## The Slayer Technique

If asked what the Slayer is, she calls it "The Dream Eater." Bhaal's children are claimed through sleep, disturbed by visions of bloodshed. When their minds break, they become the Slayer - "a beast of unspeakable violence that consumes all in its path."
