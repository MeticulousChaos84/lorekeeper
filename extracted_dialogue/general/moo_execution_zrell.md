After executing prisoners at Moonrise Towers, a companion (randomly selected) comments on reporting to Z'rell.

## Companion Reactions

**Astarion:** "Done, nice and neat. Now, let's report to the lovely Z'rell."

**Gale:** "They're dead. Z'rell will want to hear of this."

Other companions' versions:
- Karlach: "Well. That's done with. Might as well go say hello to Z'rell, then."

**Companion Interjections:**

**Astarion:** "Done, nice and neat. Now, let's report to the lovely Z'rell."

**Gale:** "They're dead. Z'rell will want to hear of this."

**Note:** Astarion's "nice and neat" and "lovely Z'rell" shows his casual attitude toward violence and his ability to charm anyone useful. Gale's more matter-of-fact "They're dead" shows he doesn't relish the violence but accepts its necessity when undercover.
