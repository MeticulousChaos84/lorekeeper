**Starting Node:** 9

In Act 3, the player encounters Araj Oblodra again outside her burning house in the Lower City. If the player previously convinced Astarion to bite her at Moonrise Towers, she's been experimenting with their blood with explosive results.

## Araj's Greeting

Araj runs out of her exploding building: "FIRE IN THE - Oh! My silk, what are the chances - it's *you!*"

If Astarion was forced to bite her before:

**Araj:** "And, ahh, the heart-stopping bloodsucker. Ever since our last liaison, I haven't been able to get you out of my mind..."

**Astarion:** "Nor have I. No matter how hard I try."

## Astarion's Reactions

### If Player Defended Astarion's Feelings

If the romanced player refuses Araj:

**Araj:** "How I made him *feel?* What I propose goes well beyond such frivolities."

**Astarion (if Vampire Lord):** "I appreciate the thought, but I'm not the person I was the last time we met. And if she can unlock the kind of power she's promising..."

**Astarion:** "Well, hearing her out won't kill us."

**Astarion (if Vampire Lord):** "Just as long as she knows who belongs to who this time."

**Astarion:** "Just a look. And if we don't like what we see, we can always kill her later."

**Astarion (if Vampire Lord):** "Don't worry - if anything happens, I'll protect you."

**Astarion:** "Well, death never stopped me before. I don't know why it should now."

### When the Player Wants to Leave

**Astarion:** "I appreciate the thought, truly, but if this is something you want to look into..."

### If Seeing Araj Again

**Astarion (if stayed Spawn):** "Oh she doesn't bother me that much. If anything, I pity her."

**Astarion (if Vampire Lord):** "Don't worry, I can tolerate her."

**Astarion:** "I would like to see her dead in a ditch, but I can tolerate this."

### When Forced to Comply

**Astarion:** "I'm fine. Let's just get this over with."

**Astarion:** "I'll be all right. Let's just get this over with."

## When Araj Blames the Player

If Araj claims the player ruined things:

**Astarion:** "No, give yourself some credit. You mostly ruined it all by yourself."

## Astarion's Refusal

If Araj tries to make demands:

**Astarion:** "And I will keep refusing until the end of time. I'm done bowing to the whims of others."

## Defending the Player

If Araj asks about Astarion biting the player:

**Astarion:** "Naturally, I always ask first. I'm civilised, unlike you."

If romanced and Araj proposes something:

**Astarion:** "They said 'no'. You should learn the meaning of the word."

**Companion Interjections:**

All dialogue in this file is Astarion's - this is his reaction to meeting Araj again after the traumatic forced-bite scene at Moonrise.

**Astarion:** "Nor have I. No matter how hard I try."

**Astarion:** "Well, hearing her out won't kill us."

**Astarion:** "Just as long as she knows who belongs to who this time."

**Astarion:** "Just a look. And if we don't like what we see, we can always kill her later."

**Astarion:** "And I will keep refusing until the end of time. I'm done bowing to the whims of others."

**Astarion:** "Naturally, I always ask first. I'm civilised, unlike you."

**Astarion:** "They said 'no'. You should learn the meaning of the word."

**Note:** This scene varies significantly based on whether Astarion ascended to Vampire Lord or stayed a Spawn. As a Lord, he's more confident and protective; as a Spawn, he's more resentful but able to pity Araj. His line "I'm done bowing to the whims of others" is particularly significant given his history of enslavement.

**Approval:** Refusing to engage with Araj after she upset Astarion grants: Astarion +1, Karlach +1, Gale +1, Wyll +1, Shadowheart +1, Halsin +1, Minsc +1, Jaheira +1 (Minthara -1)
