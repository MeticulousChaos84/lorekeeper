When arriving at Grymforge by boat, the party is greeted by hostile Duergar guards Morghal and Stone Guard Orgarth. Companions react to the threat, and Astarion has a visceral reaction to being called a slave.

## Companion Reactions to Threat

When Morghal demands a reason not to kill them, one companion (randomly selected) speaks up:

**Astarion:** "Another belligerent dwarf? This is getting tiresome."

**Gale:** "Let's not get into another scrape, shall we? Still catching my breath after the last one."

Other companions' versions:
- Lae'zel: "Let her try. My thirst for blood has yet to be quenched."
- Shadowheart: "Let's try and keep this diplomatic. I'd rather not jump into another fight quite so soon."
- Karlach: "Not in the mood for another fight, believe it or not. Can we play nice?"
- Wyll: "I reckon diplomacy may be in order. The Blade could use a breather."

## Astarion's Reaction to Slavery

If Morghal calls the party "slaves":

**Astarion:** "Call me 'slave' again, and I'll feed you your own stomach."

**Morghal:** "Ooh - this one's feisty. Thrinn's gonna knock the snot right out of him."

**Companion Interjections:**

**Astarion:** "Another belligerent dwarf? This is getting tiresome."

**Astarion:** "Call me 'slave' again, and I'll feed you your own stomach."

**Gale:** "Let's not get into another scrape, shall we? Still catching my breath after the last one."

**Note:** Astarion's violent reaction to being called a slave reveals deep trauma from his 200 years as Cazador's spawn - he was literally a slave who had to do everything his master commanded. The word triggers immediate rage. Meanwhile, Gale's line shows he prefers to avoid combat through diplomacy when possible.
