## Reactions to Philomeen Leaving

**Astarion:** "Ah, nothing says 'true love' like faking your own death to avoid someone."

**Gale:** "She has a heart made of stone, this one - that only smokepowder can break."

**Gale:** "She has a heart made of stone, this one - that only smokepowder can break."

**Note:** These reactions show both characters' humor in dark situations. Astarion's sardonic "nothing says 'true love'" is classic cynicism - he finds the manipulation amusing rather than sad. As someone who spent 200 years faking emotions for Cazador's seductions, he probably appreciates the deception on some level. Gale's line is a dark pun - Philomeen's "heart of stone" could only be "broken" by the smokepowder she was threatening to detonate. It's morbid wordplay that shows Gale's wit even when commenting on someone's callousness.
