When Sarevok reveals the sacrifice required for Bhaal's blood baptism - a helpless hollyphant (a small winged elephant celestial) - companions react with varying degrees of disbelief.

## Reactions to the Hollyphant Sacrifice

**Gale:** "I never credited Bhaal with a sense of humour. This is some sick joke of his - let's not be part of it."

**Astarion:** "This is the grand sacrifice demanded by Bhaal? *This?*"

**Note:** Both companions express incredulity, but from very different angles. Gale recognizes the sacrifice as deliberately cruel - killing a helpless, cute celestial creature is Bhaal's twisted joke, and he wants no part of it. His moral objection is clear. Astarion's repeated "*This?*" sounds more like disappointment at the spectacle's anticlimactic nature - after all the buildup, the grand sacrifice is... a tiny elephant? His reaction focuses on the absurdity rather than the cruelty, which says something about his desensitization to violence.
