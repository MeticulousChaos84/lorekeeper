When encountering Thisobald Thorm, the bloated brewer at the Waning Moon distillery, companions react to his monstrous, curse-corrupted form.

## Initial Reactions to His Appearance

**Astarion:** "Keep your distance. He looks like he could burst any second."

**Astarion:** "I've seen some grotesques in my time, but this is something else."

**Gale:** "Look at the thing... A few more tastes of its own medicine and it'll burst."

**Gale:** "Was this once a man? The shadows have corrupted him beyond comprehension."

**Companion Interjections:**

**Note:** Both companions notice the same thing - Thisobald is so bloated with his own brews that he could literally explode. Astarion's "I've seen some grotesques in my time" is an understatement from a 200-year-old vampire who's seen plenty of horrors. Gale's observation that the shadows have "corrupted him beyond comprehension" shows his analytical mind trying and failing to understand what he's seeing. Both reactions also hint at the solution to the encounter - get him to drink more and he'll burst.
