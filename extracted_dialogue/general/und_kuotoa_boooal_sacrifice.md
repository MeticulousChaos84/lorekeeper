In the Underdark, the party encounters BOOOAL, a kuo-toa "god" created by the collective belief of the fish people. BOOOAL demands a sacrifice, and the player can offer up their companions.

## Gale's Warning

When present for the sacrifice demand:

**Gale:** "Tread carefully, now. Not even a god would survive sacrificing me."

**BOOOAL:** "IT'S SIMPLE. MAKE AN OFFERING - OR BECOME ONE."

## Companion Betrayal Reactions

### If the Player Sacrifices Astarion

**Astarion:** "What? You're bowing to this gutter-throated idol?"

**Astarion:** "You wretched little worm. I'll show you murder worthy of a god!"

### If the Player Sacrifices Gale

**Gale:** "Not treading carefully, then? Out with a bang it is."

### Other Companion Reactions

- Shadowheart: "You can sacrifice yourself first, you spineless rat!"
- Lae'zel: "Fool. *Htak'a!*"
- Karlach: "Godsdammit soldier, I trusted you! And now I have to kill you *and* all these weird fish lads. Ugh!"
- Wyll: "So it's like that, is it? So be it - the Blade does not yield!"

**Companion Interjections:**

**Gale:** "Tread carefully, now. Not even a god would survive sacrificing me."

**Gale:** "Not treading carefully, then? Out with a bang it is."

**Astarion:** "What? You're bowing to this gutter-throated idol?"

**Astarion:** "You wretched little worm. I'll show you murder worthy of a god!"

**Note:** Gale's warning "Not even a god would survive sacrificing me" is an ominous reference to the Netherese orb in his chest - if he dies, it explodes. His calm "Out with a bang it is" confirms he intends to take everyone with him. Astarion's "gutter-throated idol" shows his contempt for BOOOAL, while "murder worthy of a god" shows his theatrical flair even when furious at betrayal.
