# Final Decision - The Netherbrain Choice

At the climax of the battle, with the Netherbrain subdued, the player must make the final choice: destroy the brain and the tadpoles, or dominate it and rule the world.

## Astarion Encourages World Domination

If Astarion is present and became a Vampire Ascendant (not spawn), he encourages the player to seize power:

**Astarion (to romantic partner):** "It can be ours, my love. The whole world - we only have to take it."

**Astarion (to Dark Urge who accepted Bhaal):** "I know what you're thinking. So let's do it. Let's seize the whole damn world and be reviled together."

**Astarion (general):** "We could do it, you know. We could rule the world."

## The Choice

The narrator describes visions of possible futures as the player considers their options:

For Astarion (if player is Astarion avatar and didn't ascend):
"You glimpse a future where you lose all the gifts the parasite gave you - a future where you no longer see the sun."

### Destroy the Brain
Command the brain to destroy all tadpoles and then itself, saving the world.

### Dominate the Brain
Take control of the Netherbrain and use its power to rule the world.

For Dark Urge who accepted Bhaal, choosing to destroy the brain instead means defying their Father - with dire consequences for their sanity.
