When Raphael appears in the Gauntlet of Shar and Astarion proposes a deal about his scars, this scene reveals crucial information about Astarion's past trauma and his desperation to understand the markings Cazador carved into his back.

## Astarion Proposes the Deal

**Astarion:** "Wait! Before you go, I have a proposal of my own."

**Astarion:** "This is serious business, devil."

**Astarion:** "My old - well, a long time ago someone carved some runes into my back. I'd rather like to know what they say."

## Raphael's Terms

When Raphael offers to translate the scars in exchange for killing Yurgir:

**Astarion:** "A fairer deal than I expected."

## If the Party Hasn't Seen His Scars

When Raphael forcibly removes Astarion's shirt to reveal the scars:

**Astarion:** "Gods damn it."

**Astarion:** "Yes, fine, we'll kill this damn creature of yours."

## After the Scars Are Revealed

**Astarion:** "Well. Now you know."

### If the Player Asks Why He Didn't Tell Them

**Astarion:** "I - perhaps I should have, but I'm not used to asking for help and being met with, well... help."

**Astarion:** "But what's done is done, so how about we stop discussing it and just kill this beast?"

### If the Player Empathizes with His Pain

**Astarion:** "Cazador worked on it from dusk until dawn, all with an ancient blade he called his 'needle'. Cutting and tearing, starting over if I screamed or winced too much."

**Astarion:** "It was a rough night."

### If the Player Is Upset About the Devil Deal

**Astarion:** "It could be infinitely worse. We seem to be rather good at killing things."

**Astarion:** "Let's just go. Standing here chatting gets us nowhere."

**Astarion:** "Although I should probably get dressed first..."

**Companion Interjections:**

**Astarion:** "My old - well, a long time ago someone carved some runes into my back."

**Astarion:** "Cazador worked on it from dusk until dawn, all with an ancient blade he called his 'needle'. Cutting and tearing, starting over if I screamed or winced too much."

**Astarion:** "It was a rough night."

**Astarion:** "I'm not used to asking for help and being met with, well... help."

**Note:** This scene is pivotal for Astarion's character arc. His slip when he starts to say "my old master" but stops himself shows he's still processing his trauma. The description of Cazador's torture is harrowing - "cutting and tearing, starting over if I screamed or winced too much" - and his understatement ("It was a rough night") is classic Astarion deflection through dark humor. His admission that he's "not used to asking for help and being met with... help" reveals the depth of his trauma - after 200 years of manipulation and abuse, genuine support is foreign to him. His final line about getting dressed adds levity while also showing his vulnerability at being exposed - both physically and emotionally - against his will.
