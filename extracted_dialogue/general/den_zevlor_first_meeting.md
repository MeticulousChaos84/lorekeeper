# Zevlor - First Meeting at the Grove

**Source:** `DEN_TieflingLeader_DenIntro.html`
**Starting Node:** 56

---

After the confrontation between Aradin and Zevlor at the grove entrance (which the player helped resolve), Zevlor speaks with the player. He apologizes for his outburst and thanks them for their help at the gate.

"Forgive that display. Aradin's a blowhard, but that's no cause for me to join him. Thank you for your help out there. I'm Zevlor."

If the player is a drow: "I wouldn't have looked to a drow for help, but I'm grateful all the same."

If Wyll is the avatar: "And if I'm not mistaken, *you're* the Blade of Frontiers."

## The Grove's Situation

Zevlor explains the situation: visitors are no longer welcome in the grove. The druids are forcing everyone out because of goblin attacks on the refugees.

If the player asks about the place: "A druids' grove, dedicated to the Oak Father, Silvanus. You'll find its keepers just as thorny, I fear."

Zevlor explains that the druids have started a ritual (the Rite of Thorns) to seal the grove off from the rest of the world. The First Druid, Kagha, won't see him, so he asks if the player would speak to her for him.

## The Choice to Help

### If the player agrees to help:

**Approval:** Astarion -1, Lae'zel -1, Gale +1, Wyll +5, Karlach +3

**Astarion:** "Really? We're messengers, now?"

**Gale:** "I think you should, yes. No harm in trying the diplomatic route."

Zevlor also mentions Nettie, the healer in the inner grove, who might be able to help with the player's tadpole problem.

### If the player declines to help:

**Approval:** Astarion +2, Lae'zel +1, Shadowheart +1, Wyll -1, Karlach -1

**Astarion:** "Turning your back on the needy to save your own skin? Maybe we'll get along after all."

**Gale:** "We've our problems, granted, but there might be some merit in shutting down a local conflict, no?"

**Wyll:** "These poor souls seek a champion - and you turn your back?"

Zevlor understands: "I can only thank you for the help you've already given."

## Background Information

Zevlor explains the tieflings are refugees from Elturel, bound for Baldur's Gate. If the player asks about drow prejudice, he clarifies: "I meant no insult. It's simply that yours are a people at war with themselves - I've never known them to care for outsiders."

If the player requests payment: "Then you'll have better luck looting the goblins outside - this is a druids' grove."
