When Sovereign Spaw asks the party to hunt Nere in the duergar camp, companions react to being given another task.

## Reactions to the Quest

**Astarion:** "I'm more than happy to kill this - whoever he is, but tell me there's something in it for us?"

**Gale:** "My, but this sovereign likes to delegate."

**Companion Interjections:**

**Astarion:** "I'm more than happy to kill this - whoever he is, but tell me there's something in it for us?"

**Gale:** "My, but this sovereign likes to delegate."

**Note:** Both reactions show mild exasperation at being given yet another task. Astarion's response is characteristically transactional - he doesn't care who Nere is, he just wants to know what's in it for the party. His pragmatism is refreshing: he's willing to kill, but not for free. Gale's dry observation that the sovereign "likes to delegate" is subtle wit - the mushroom king is literally just sitting there asking others to do his dirty work. It's a polite way of pointing out that they're being used.
