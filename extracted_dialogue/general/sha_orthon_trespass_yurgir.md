In the Gauntlet of Shar, the party confronts Yurgir the Orthon in his lair. Astarion has a personal stake in this encounter - Raphael promised to translate his scars in exchange for killing this escaped devil.

## Astarion's Motivation

When discovering Yurgir killed the Dark Justiciars:

**Astarion:** "So he's the one who slaughtered the Justiciars - we can kill him now?"

When asked why the urgency:

**Astarion:** "Because if he doesn't die, then Raphael won't tell me a damn thing about my scars."

**Companion Interjections:**

**Astarion:** "So he's the one who slaughtered the Justiciars - we can kill him now?"

**Astarion:** "Because if he doesn't die, then Raphael won't tell me a damn thing about my scars."

**Note:** This scene shows Astarion's desperation to understand what Cazador carved into his back. He made a deal with Raphael - a devil - and is anxious to fulfill his end of the bargain. The bluntness of "we can kill him now?" reveals how much the mystery of his scars has consumed him.
