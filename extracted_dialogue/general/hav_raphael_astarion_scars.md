At Last Light Inn, Astarion approaches Raphael to ask about the mysterious scars carved into his back. This scene reveals crucial backstory about how Cazador tortured Astarion to create the ritual markings.

## Approaching Raphael

**Astarion:** "I do. I have a proposal for you."

When Raphael tries to deflect:

**Astarion:** "This is serious business, devil."

## The Reveal

Raphael magicks away Astarion's shirt to examine the scars:

**Astarion:** "Gods damn it."

After Raphael reads what's written on his back:

**Astarion:** "Well. Now you know."

## Reacting to Player Support

If the player is upset Astarion didn't tell them:

**Astarion:** "I - perhaps I should have. I'm not exactly used to asking for help and being met with, well... help."

**Astarion:** "But what's done is done, so how about we stop talking about it and just get on with things?"

**Astarion:** "Although I should probably get dressed first..."

## Explaining the Scars' Origin

When asked about how he got them:

**Astarion:** "Cazador worked on it from dusk until dawn, all with an ancient blade he called his 'needle'. Cutting and tearing, starting over if I screamed or winced too much."

**Astarion:** "It was a rough night."

## Looking Forward

About facing Cazador:

**Astarion:** "It could be infinitely worse. We seem to be rather good at killing things."

**Astarion:** "Let's just go. Standing here chatting gets us nowhere."

When Raphael delays:

**Astarion:** "You'll 'get back' to me? This is important, devil. When?"
