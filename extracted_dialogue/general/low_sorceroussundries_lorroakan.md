In Sorcerous Sundries, the party confronts Lorroakan, the wizard who seeks Nightsong. If Gale is pursuing godhood, he reveals his true ambitions to Lorroakan.

## Gale's Godhood Ambitions

If Gale is pursuing the Crown of Karsus:

**Gale:** "Once we acquire it, your ambitions will be dwarfed. I will be able to stand against Mystra, and wrest her powers from her. For the betterment of *all*."

When Lorroakan doubts him:

**Gale:** "Perhaps *you* could not. But Netheril's power is in my blood, and Mystra? I know her in ways that most mortals can only dream of."

**Gale:** "I'm my own man. I make my own choices."

## Deflecting Lorroakan's Questions

When Lorroakan asks what Gale is muttering:

**Gale:** "Nothing at all, friend. I was merely admiring your ambition."

**Gale:** "Nothing, friend. Just a little trapped wind - I'm sure you understand."

## Astarion's Commentary

If the player quickly agrees to hand over Nightsong:

**Astarion:** "Quick to hand someone over, aren't you?"

On Lorroakan's directness:

**Astarion:** "I do admire your directness, though. Quick and to the point."

**Companion Interjections:**

**Gale:** "Once we acquire it, your ambitions will be dwarfed. I will be able to stand against Mystra, and wrest her powers from her. For the betterment of *all*."

**Gale:** "Perhaps *you* could not. But Netheril's power is in my blood, and Mystra? I know her in ways that most mortals can only dream of."

**Gale:** "I'm my own man. I make my own choices."

**Astarion:** "Quick to hand someone over, aren't you?"

**Astarion:** "I do admire your directness, though. Quick and to the point."

**Note:** This scene reveals Gale's most ambitious thinking - he plans to use Netherese magic to challenge Mystra herself and "wrest her powers from her." His claim that he knows Mystra "in ways that most mortals can only dream of" references their former romantic relationship. Astarion's lines show his moral judgment (criticizing quick betrayal) and appreciation for bluntness.
