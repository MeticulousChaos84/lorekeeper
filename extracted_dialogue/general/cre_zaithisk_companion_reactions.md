When the party considers using the githyanki Zaith'isk device to potentially remove the tadpole, companions offer their opinions on whether to trust the dangerous machine.

## Companion Reactions to the Device

One companion (randomly selected) warns the player:

**Astarion:** "I'm all for it, but... well, you first."

**Gale:** "Well... could go either way. But we came this far - should at least try."

Other companions:
- Shadowheart: "I don't like the look of this thing. Its 'cure' could be a metal bolt punched through your skull."
- Karlach: "Never stick your head in an extraplanar torture device. A rule to live by."

**Companion Interjections:**

**Astarion:** "I'm all for it, but... well, you first."

**Gale:** "Well... could go either way. But we came this far - should at least try."

**Note:** These reactions perfectly capture both characters. Astarion's "you first" shows his self-preservation instinct - he's willing to see someone else take the risk before committing. Gale's "could go either way" is characteristically analytical but ultimately optimistic - he weighs the odds but decides the potential reward is worth the risk. Both reactions reveal their approaches to uncertainty: Astarion deflects danger onto others, while Gale calculates and proceeds.
