At Sharess' Caress in Lower City, the party can hire the drow twins Nym and Sorn together - but only with a willing partner. This scene contains extensive character-revealing dialogue from companions about intimacy and desire.

## Astarion's Romantic Partner Path

When Astarion agrees to participate:

**Astarion:** "I'd like to try doing things like this again, now I'm free to find my own desires."

**Astarion:** "And don't worry, I'll dart out if I don't enjoy it faster than I used to run from the sun."

**Astarion:** "Consider yourself invited! Combined, we've had five hundred years to hone our talents - let's put them to bad use."

### If Player Tries to Hire Them Alone

**Astarion:** "What? *Really*? What could they possibly offer you that I can't do better?"

## Gale's Romantic Partner Path

When asked to participate:

**Gale:** "Well I suppose it would do no good to back out now. Let us begin this little anthropological study, if we must."

### If Gale Declines

**Gale:** "You're adorable even when you're teasing me. But I must decline."

**Gale:** "I appreciate that - but I can't help how I feel."

## Astarion's Reactions

When treated with kindness:

**Astarion:** "Eugh, don't be so nice to me! It makes me want to be nice back."

Reflecting on his past:

**Astarion:** "What a world. I never dreamed I'd be on the *paying* end in a brothel."

**Astarion:** "But, our leader here has made the dire mistake of failing to sleep with me so far, and it's a mistake I have been *aching* to correct."

**Note:** This scene reveals profound character differences in intimacy. Astarion's "now I'm free to find my own desires" is crucial - he's explicitly choosing this, not being forced. His threat to "dart out faster than I used to run from the sun" shows he sets boundaries even while being adventurous. The contrast with his past as a sex worker under Cazador ("never dreamed I'd be on the paying end") shows his healing. Gale's framing as an "anthropological study" reveals his intellectualizing discomfort, while his "I can't help how I feel" shows he's a romantic at heart. Astarion's "don't be so nice to me" shows how unused he is to genuine kindness.
