---

Near Auntie Ethel's hag lair, the player encounters Gandrel, a Gur monster hunter tracking Astarion. The player can choose to betray Astarion by revealing his identity, leading to his capture.

## About Gandrel

Gandrel is described as "pleasant, cheerful, and a little eccentric - but shows his experience and expertise when warning us about the hag. He's affable and unassuming, but shows moments of steel when discussing his quarry."

## Astarion Questions the Hunter

If the player asks what will happen to the vampire:

**Gandrel:** "Not this time. My orders are to capture him."

**Astarion:** "Oh? And bring him where, exactly?"

**Gandrel:** "Baldur's Gate. My people wait for me there."

## The Betrayal

If the player says "I'm here to help. This is Astarion - the vampire you're hunting":

**Gandrel:** "What?"

**Astarion:** "What?!"

**Gandrel:** "It isn't possible."

**Astarion:** "You idiot. What have you done?"

If the player responds "I've delivered a monster to a monster hunter":

**Astarion:** "You treacherous little worm!"

*Gandrel knocks Astarion unconscious while he's focused on the player.*

**Gandrel:** "A just choice. I thank you for your help. My people work to rid this world of evil - you are a friend to our cause."

## Aftermath Options

If the player says "It's my pleasure. Really":

**Gandrel:** "It's amazing you survived, travelling with a beast like that. I have a cage ready nearby - it will hold him when he wakes."

**Gandrel:** "Thank you for this. And for cleansing this swamp of the hag. You have done good here today. Safe travels."

*Gandrel walks away carrying the unconscious Astarion.*

If the player asks what will happen to him:

**Gandrel:** "I'll return him to my tribe, as ordered. Whatever fate awaits him there, I'm sure it is deserved."

If the player asks to keep his stuff:

**Gandrel:** "It's yours. This is the only prize I need."

## Protecting Astarion

If the player says "Relax, he's not taking you anywhere":

**Gandrel:** "There, I'm afraid you're wrong."

*Combat initiates.*

**Astarion:** "You treacherous little worm!"

**Note:** This is one of the most dramatic betrayal scenes in Act 1. The player can permanently lose Astarion by handing him over to the Gur. His lines show genuine fear and outrage - being captured means being returned to Cazador, his vampire master who tortured him for centuries. The scene demonstrates how Astarion's safety depends entirely on the player's choices.
