In Balthazar's laboratory at Moonrise Towers, the player finds a magic circle used in the creation of Moonlanterns. Gale examines the arcane sigils and explains their purpose.

## Gale Analyzes the Circle

**Gale:** "The sigils are written in a curious mix of tongues - ancient Calishite, Netherese, and something else I can't quite make out. If I'm reading it correctly - it was used in the creation of Moonlanterns."

**Gale:** "It's been mostly drained, but even now contains a powerful dose of Shadow Weave."

**Gale:** "It's inert, if that's what you mean. But it still reeks of the Shadow Weave, and its polluting magic will continue to escape for as long as it lies abandoned here."

## About the Design's Origin

**Gale:** "Well, it wasn't in his published archives - it was merely a sketch. He invoked Mystra's guidance on how to complete it."

**Gale:** "It was a quite fascinating design, though the version created here is a strange corruption of the Weavepasha's original intent."

## Warning the Player

If the player wants to use the circle:

**Gale:** "Or did you wish to use it? I assure you - it's pointless. You'll have nothing more than a sore head and a very dissatisfied wizard to show for it."

**Gale:** "I'd advise against it - in your case, at least. No disrespect intended, but this is not your typical magic."

## When Ignored or Insulted

If the player is rude:

**Gale:** "Oh, charming. I hope the Shadow Weave was to blame for that little outburst of unwarranted discourtesy."

If the player insists on doing it themselves:

**Gale:** "If you think you know best, go right ahead."

**Gale:** "Gods, you're obstinate."

## When Given Permission to Act

**Gale:** "Very well. Stand back, if you please."
