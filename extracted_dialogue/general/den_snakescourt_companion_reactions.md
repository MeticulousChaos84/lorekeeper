During Arabella's trial before Kagha, when the player reaches for their weapon, companions react with contrasting attitudes toward violence.

## When the Player Reaches for a Weapon

**Astarion:** "Yes! Let's have some fun."

**Gale:** "Hold on! It's not too late to settle this without bloodshed."

## When the Player Backs Down

If the player decides not to attack after reaching for their weapon:

**Astarion:** "Don't be a coward. We could take them. We could kill them all."

**Gale:** "Good. Let's focus on the girl first. We can settle with the snake later."

**Companion Interjections:**

**Astarion:** "Yes! Let's have some fun."

**Astarion:** "Don't be a coward. We could take them. We could kill them all."

**Gale:** "Hold on! It's not too late to settle this without bloodshed."

**Gale:** "Good. Let's focus on the girl first. We can settle with the snake later."

**Note:** This scene perfectly contrasts Astarion and Gale's approaches to conflict. Astarion is eager for violence - his "Let's have some fun" treats combat as entertainment, and he's genuinely disappointed when the player backs down, calling them a coward. Meanwhile, Gale consistently advocates for diplomacy. His "Hold on!" shows urgency to prevent unnecessary death, and even when backing down he frames it strategically - "settle with the snake later" suggests he's not against violence, just against pointless violence that endangers the child. This foreshadows their broader character arcs: Astarion's comfort with violence versus Gale's preference for measured responses.
