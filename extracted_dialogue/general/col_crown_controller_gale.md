After witnessing the Netherbrain wearing the Crown of Karsus, Gale analyzes the implications of this powerful Netherese artifact.

## Gale's Analysis of the Crown

If Gale already knows about the Crown:

**Gale:** "Whoever controls the crown could reshape the world... *if* they can control it."

When first seeing Netherese magic used by the Chosen:

**Gale:** "Netherese? These Chosen are powerful indeed to have such magic in their command."

**Companion Interjections:**

**Gale:** "Whoever controls the crown could reshape the world... *if* they can control it."

**Gale:** "Netherese? These Chosen are powerful indeed to have such magic in their command."

**Note:** Gale's dialogue reveals his deep understanding of magical history and power. His emphasis on "*if* they can control it" shows he knows the Crown's dangers - it killed Karsus and brought down Netheril. His recognition of Netherese magic demonstrates his scholarly expertise. For Gale, who once sought forbidden power from Mystra herself, seeing the Crown in the wrong hands must feel particularly meaningful - it's the ultimate temptation he might have faced if he'd continued down his path of ambition.
