During Abdirak's Loviatar penance ritual where the player is whipped, Astarion (often alongside Shadowheart) has darkly enthusiastic reactions to the scene.

## First Strike Reactions

When Shadowheart and Astarion are both present:

**Shadowheart:** "Would you have joined up with them if you'd known they'd be indulging in this sort of thing, Astarion?"

**Astarion:** "I mean, I had my hopes."

When Astarion reacts alone:

**Astarion:** "Oh, bravo! Encore!"

## Second Strike Reactions

When both are present and watching the bloodshed:

**Astarion:** "My my. Who knew our friend had so much blood in them?"

**Shadowheart:** "Try not to lick your lips as you say that."
*(If the party knows Astarion is a vampire)*

When Astarion reacts alone:

**Astarion:** "It was a fine strike. Excellent form!"

**Companion Interjections:**

**Astarion:** "I mean, I had my hopes."

**Astarion:** "Oh, bravo! Encore!"

**Astarion:** "My my. Who knew our friend had so much blood in them?"

**Astarion:** "It was a fine strike. Excellent form!"

**Note:** This scene reveals the deeply unsettling aspects of Astarion's character. His "I had my hopes" about the player being into pain is darkly flirtatious. His enthusiastic "Oh, bravo! Encore!" while clapping shows genuine enjoyment of the violence. The blood comment - "Who knew our friend had so much blood in them?" - takes on extra significance given his vampirism, and Shadowheart's response ("Try not to lick your lips") shows she's caught on to exactly what he's thinking. His cheering on the priest with "Excellent form!" treats the torture like a sport. These reactions foreshadow the darker aspects of his past that will be revealed later - after 200 years of being Cazador's instrument of pain, he's been desensitized to violence and even finds it entertaining.
