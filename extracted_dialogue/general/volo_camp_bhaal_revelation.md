# Volo - Camp Dialogue: Bhaal's Return

**Source:** `CAMP_Volo.html`
**Starting Node:** 114

---

Volo greets the player warmly and thanks them for saving him from a mob at the Docks near the Steelwatch Foundry. He explains that his near-death experience relates to dangerous knowledge he's uncovered.

When asked why the mob turned on him:

If the player suggests Orin the Red marked him:

Volo confirms it's not Orin herself, but her dread master - the Lord of Murder has returned. He explains that Bhaal has set his sights on Baldur's Gate again, and his temple runs red with the blood of the innocent. Orin is his Chosen, able to take on the savage form of the Slayer.

If the player suggests Archduke Gortash:

Volo dismisses Gortash as "a puppy dog" compared to the real horror - then reveals Bhaal's return.

If the player suggests the cult of the Absolute:

Volo explains the Absolute is merely the outward form of something far more insidious, then reveals Bhaal's return.

If the player insults his reputation for lies:

Volo claims his dedication to truth is what endangers him, and he's uncovered a startling truth - then reveals Bhaal's return.

## Dark Urge Player Branches

If the player is a Dark Urge origin, Volo directly accuses them of being Bhaal's other Chosen:

Volo explains that Bhaalspawn are a "family set upon self-slaughter" - when there are two or more, they destroy each other until one remains. He references the hero who saved Baldur's Gate a hundred years ago by standing against "foul father and brother Sarevok."

If the player rejects Bhaal's influence:

Volo notes they have self-control but warns Bhaal's inheritance isn't shrugged off easily. He offers hope, comparing them to the heroic Bhaalspawn of old.

If the player threatens Volo:

Volo responds that Baldur's Gate has survived Bhaalspawn before and will survive them too - then flees the camp permanently.

If the player tries to deceive Volo (DC 25 Deception):

On success, Volo is disappointed but still offers help. On failure, he sees through the lie but still believes the city needs them.

## Post-Orin Branches (Dark Urge)

If Orin is already dead:

Volo is delighted and wants to document the triumph.

If the player accepted Bhaal:

Volo is anxious and indignant, warning that Baldur's Gate will survive them - then flees.

If the player resisted Bhaal:

Volo is excited about documenting this "historic deed" and offers to co-author a book with the player.

If the player was killed by Bhaal and returned:

Volo is stupendous - "Slain by the Lord of Murder, and risen again to save Baldur's Gate!"

## The Slayer and Irenicus' Book

For non-Dark Urge players (or if the player points out a Dark Urge companion), Volo explains:

The Slayer will slaughter every living thing in the city if not stopped. He has a study of the beast penned by the wizard Jon Irenicus - exiled from Suldanessellar when he attempted to seize the power of life itself, then turned to murder. A Bhaalspawn ultimately thwarted him.

Volo offers the book "A Study of the Slayer" to help defeat Orin.

If the player volunteers:

Volo is delighted. If speaking to Minsc, he's especially pleased about "a returning favourite."

If the player refuses:

Volo insists there's nobody else available. If the player continues to refuse, Volo sadly prepares to flee to "Anywhere But Here."

## The Slayer Explained

If asked what the Slayer is:

Volo calls it "The Dream Eater" - Bhaal's children are claimed through their sleep, disturbed by visions of bloodshed and terror. Once their minds break, they become the Slayer: "a beast of unspeakable violence that consumes all in its path, including the soul of the one who is host to it."

---

## Repeat Dialogue

After the initial conversation is exhausted:

Volo offers to document whatever happens next "as accurately as possible" (with his usual dubious relationship with accuracy). He can also trade with the player.
