This dialogue plays at the start of the Ketheric boss fight in the Colony. There are multiple permutations based on whether the Nightsong is alive/dead/freed, Isobel's status, and whether the player met Ketheric previously on the rooftop.

## Opening Lines

If the player killed Isobel while she was enthralled:

"You. After all you've done, after all your trifling, you *dare* strike at my daughter?! What a fool you are. I am death. She is mine. She will return - always return. And you..."

Standard opening (if player wasn't seen on rooftop):

"There you are. As predicted. What is it, I wonder, that draws one toward death like a moth to light? You could have run away. Absconded with the Prism - the one thing that could prevent me from fulfilling my destiny. But the lure of one's destiny is irresistible, isn't it? Perhaps you hoped to learn your place in history before you are erased from it. A bright flash of clarity before the snuffing-out."

If player was sent to Balthazar and survived:

"*You* - what in the name of the *Nine Hells* are you doing here?! Balthazar - I should have expected his *weakness*."

## Origin-Specific Responses

When Ketheric speaks of the player's "place":

**Astarion (Avatar):** "I know my destiny - he's waiting in Baldur's Gate. And you're standing in my way, old man."

**Gale (Avatar):** "Funny you say that. My place is right here, and my 'bright flash' could be the last thing you see..."

**Lae'zel (Avatar):** "I am not intimidated by the likes of you. I will gain my queen's favour and ascend." / "The liberation of my people may be close at hand. And I will stop at nothing to see it done."

**Shadowheart (Avatar):** "My place is right here - ready to strike you down in Lady Shar's name." (Shar path) / "My place is in Baldur's Gate. Yours is in a grave - permanently, this time."

**Wyll (Avatar):** "Damned wretch. I will liberate my father from your rotten hands."

**Karlach (Avatar):** "Neither you nor your pal Gortash know the first thing about my 'place'."

**Halsin (Avatar):** "I am right where I need to be - ready to vanquish you and your curse, forever."

**Jaheira (Avatar):** "I sense you ask questions only to hear yourself answer them - so by all means, tell me my *place*."

**Minthara (Avatar):** "My place is standing over you, with my boot on your throat."

**Dark Urge:** "I will find out who I was, and end my killing fate." / "I will reach my own crimson castle, and your corpse will pave my path."

Ketheric responds to the Dark Urge's violent line: "A mad dog like Orin might be impressed. I am not."

## Ketheric's Motivations

If asked why the Prism is important:

"The very fact of your being attests to its power - despite your infection, you resisted the brain, here in the heart of its domain. What good is an army of thralls if they do not obey their master?"

He explains his devotion to Myrkul:

"My Lord Myrkul gave me the one thing I desired - the one thing that no other god could grant me. My daughter's life returned. Her heart beating once more. For that, he asked that I serve as his Chosen, join Orin and Gortash to grow the cult of the Absolute, and then... take control of it. He's never had a more devoted follower."

"I have fought great wars before, in the service of other gods, and other powers. But for Myrkul, I would condemn all of Faerûn to death. You are all that stands between me and my destiny - and you have brought the Prism here. I will kill you now. And then I will raise you as my servant."

## Attempting Mercy

If the player previously convinced Ketheric to doubt himself (DC 18 Persuasion):

"I was ready to show you mercy before. It's still not too late. You can repent."

On success: "Repent? Would that even be possible? Perhaps..." (This triggers a skip to his Apostle form)

On failure: "For a moment - a moment only - I was weak. No longer."

## Isobel's Farewell

If Isobel is present (tadpoled):

Ketheric: "Say farewell, Isobel."

Isobel: "I'm grateful to you for bringing me home. I was a fool to resist. I know better now. Good luck in the City of Judgement. I wish you the best, sincerely."

If Nightsong is freed and sees Isobel:

Nightsong: "Isobel - my love, what has happened to you?"

Isobel (coldly, due to tadpole): "In your cage, Aylin."

## Final Lines

Ketheric offers the party to Myrkul:

"My Lord, I offer you these souls so they may return as servants to your cause. Join the army of the dead, True Soul. Witness Lord Myrkul's glory!"

If Nightsong is freed, she rallies the player:

"You are no True Soul - *you* are a *champion*. Kill the madman. I fight at your side."
