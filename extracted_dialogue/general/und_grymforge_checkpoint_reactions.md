When arriving at the duergar camp in Grymforge and encountering the slavers, companions have varied reactions to the situation and the enslaved gnomes.

## On Arrival

**Astarion:** "Another belligerent dwarf? This is getting tiresome."

**Gale:** "Let's not get into another scrape, shall we? Still catching my breath after the last one."

## Reactions to the Enslaved Gnomes

**Astarion:** "Let's do the job and get out of here. All this talk of slaves is just depressing."

**Astarion:** "All the charm and wit you'd expect from a slaver. Even a slaver of gnomes."

**Gale:** "There's the matter of the gnomes, too. Wouldn't do to stand by and keep them enslaved."

**Gale:** "She really oozes charm, this one. Perhaps we should spare a thought for the wretches she's enslaved."

## On the Plan to Free Nere

When learning they must free Nere before killing him:

**Astarion:** "We have to free Nere before we can take his head? Sounds like a lot of wasted effort."

**Gale:** "So we must save the drow first, then sever his head after... Pleasantries like that make me quite homesick."

## When the Duergar Calls Astarion "Slave"

**Astarion:** "Call me 'slave' again, and I'll feed you your own stomach."

**Companion Interjections:**

**Astarion:** "Let's do the job and get out of here. All this talk of slaves is just depressing."

**Astarion:** "Call me 'slave' again, and I'll feed you your own stomach."

**Gale:** "There's the matter of the gnomes, too. Wouldn't do to stand by and keep them enslaved."

**Gale:** "So we must save the drow first, then sever his head after... Pleasantries like that make me quite homesick."

**Note:** This scene contains some of Astarion's most revealing dialogue about his trauma. His comment that "talk of slaves is just depressing" is a rare moment of emotional honesty - slavery hits too close to home for the former spawn. His snarky observation about the slaver's "charm and wit" maintains his sardonic exterior, but the mask slips completely when the duergar calls him "slave." His threat to "feed you your own stomach" is pure visceral rage - the word triggers 200 years of trauma. Gale's reaction to the gnomes shows his moral compass (wouldn't do to "stand by"), while his dry humor about Nere ("Pleasantries like that make me quite homesick") shows he can joke even about unpleasant necessities.
