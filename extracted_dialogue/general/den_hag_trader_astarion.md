When encountering Auntie Ethel posing as a helpful potion seller in the Druid Grove, Astarion has an enthusiastically unhinged reaction to her eccentric behavior.

## Astarion's Reaction

When asked whether to tell Ethel about their condition:

**Astarion:** "Why she sounds positively demented."

**Astarion:** "I love it! Let's tell her everything."

**Companion Interjections:**

**Astarion:** "Why she sounds positively demented."

**Astarion:** "I love it! Let's tell her everything."

**Note:** This brief exchange captures Astarion's dark sense of humor perfectly. While Karlach is suspicious and Wyll warns about potential danger, Astarion is delighted by Ethel's unhinged energy. His "I love it!" suggests he finds her entertaining, and his eagerness to "tell her everything" shows he either genuinely likes chaos or recognizes a kindred manipulative spirit. Either way, he's the only companion who wants to engage with the clearly unstable woman.
