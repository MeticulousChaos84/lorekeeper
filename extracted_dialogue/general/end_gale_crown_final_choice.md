After the final battle, Gale must decide what to do with the Crown of Karsus that fell into the Chionthar. This is a major branching scene where Gale can choose godhood or return the Crown to Mystra.

## Gale Reveals His Intentions

A companion notices Gale staring at the river:

**Gale:** "The Crown - it's somewhere in the Chionthar."

**Gale:** "If I salvage the stones, I can reforge it."

## Path A: Returning Crown to Mystra

If Gale promised to return the Crown:

**Gale:** "And once I have, I'll return it to Mystra."

**Gale:** "She'll cure me of my affliction, and I'll finally be free."

If the player supports this decision:

**Gale:** "Sage and timely counsel, as always. And I intend to heed it."

**Gale:** "Regardless, it's the right thing to do. That's good enough for me."

**Gale:** "A wise man learns from his mistakes, and strives not to repeat them. I shall bring the Crown to Mystra."

## Path B: Pursuing Godhood

If Gale was swayed toward using the Crown for himself:

**Gale:** "With the Crown in my hands, I would be unstoppable. The Karsite Weave would be mine to command."

**Gale:** "I would be more than the greatest wizard who ever lived - I would be a god."

If the player questions this:

**Gale:** "Want, need, deserve... Choose whatever word you prefer, but it is what I'm going to do."

**Gale:** "Mystra has dictated the terms of my potential for long enough. The Crown would grant me control of my own destiny at last."

**Gale:** "Think of all I could achieve, all that I could grant to those whose ambitions are restrained by Mystra's yoke. I could raise a new Netheril right here in Faerûn."

## If Gale Romanced Player and Pursues Godhood

If the player says "You'll make a fine god, but I can't go with you":

**Gale:** "I understand. You are right to heed such doubts, however much sadness it brings me to leave you behind."

If the player wishes Gale luck:

**Gale:** "It's I who should be saying such things. Do not think I leave you without a heart as heavy as your own. But I owe it to myself to follow where destiny leads."

**Gale:** "I will never forget you - that I promise. And if you ever feel differently, there will be a place waiting for you in the heavens."

If the player chooses to ascend with Gale:

**Gale:** "That day cannot come soon enough. But first, I must retrieve the Crown."

**Gale:** "Have patience a while and I will return to you, carrying immortality in one hand and offering you ascension with the other. I will be a god, as will you."

## If Player Criticizes Gale's Hubris

If the player says "Your hubris was your downfall once":

**Gale:** "And I thought you wise enough to recognise that I am not the man I once was."

**Gale:** "It seems that we've come to an impasse. I stand on the threshold of divine ascension, and you would try to keep me grounded."

If romanced:

**Gale:** "It's not your fault - I can hardly expect you to understand. But nor will I relinquish the chance of godhood for a love that would only last a mortal lifetime. I'm sorry."

If not romanced:

**Gale:** "It's not your fault - I can hardly expect you to understand. But nor will I relinquish this chance because you are unwilling to imagine a world where I succeed."

**Gale:** "I will never forget you - that much I promise. And if one day you feel differently, I would be honoured to have you as my Chosen."

## The Crown's Power

**Gale:** "The power of Karsus would be in my hands..."

**Gale:** "But what then? What would I do with it, once I have it?"

**Gale:** "Why should I?"

## If Gale Rejects Godhood

**Gale:** "Ugh, no. Having seen what we've seen of those who chase godhood, I'm quite content with my mortality."

**Gale:** "If this adventure has taught me anything, it's that there are things in this world far more valuable than power."

**Gale:** "Besides, I've grown quite fond of this merry band of ours, and I'd quite like to see what happens to it."

If romanced:

**Gale:** "I promise, you'll have your fill of divinity at my hands. And I at yours, I hope. But only in the metaphorical sense."

**Gale:** "I'm sure."

**Gale:** "And a more deserving one this time around."

## Astarion's Appearance

**Astarion:** "So, what next? Something fun, I hope?"

**Companion Interjections:**

All primary dialogue is Gale's - this is his defining post-battle decision moment. Companions make brief comments encouraging or warning him, and one companion asks "What shall we do next?" at the end.

**Astarion:** "So, what next? Something fun, I hope?"

**Note:** This scene is separate from the immediate post-battle Crown decision. This triggers after the Githyanki leave and Gale has time to contemplate his future. The branching depends heavily on earlier choices about whether to give the Crown to Mystra or keep it.
