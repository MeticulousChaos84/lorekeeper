At the Goblin Camp, the player encounters a drunk goblin who makes various demands. Companions react to the player's creative solutions.

## Companion Reactions

When the player tries to extract information seductively:

**Gale:** "Well! I've never seen sleight of tongue quite like that before."

When the player wants to leave without hearing details:

**Astarion:** "No? I want to hear every sordid detail."

When the player uses non-violent solutions:

**Astarion:** "Oh don't be like that. Not every problem has to be beaten to death, my dear."

When the player bites or takes a toe:

**Astarion:** "Not bad. I would've taken the whole toe, but whatever works for you."

When encouraged to kiss the goblin's foot:

**Astarion:** "Well? Go on, give him a nibble."

**Gale:** "I feel I should warn you that the average goblin foot is host to some two dozen toe-curling diseases."
