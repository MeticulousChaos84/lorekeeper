Upon entering the Ketheric boss chamber in the Colony, a cinematic plays showing the three Chosen of the Dead Three preparing to proceed with their master plan.

## The Confrontation

Gortash confronts Ketheric: "You said it was under control."

Ketheric dismissively replies that he doesn't answer to Gortash.

If Karlach is present, she recognizes Gortash immediately:

**Karlach:** "Motherfucker! *Gortash!*"

(If Karlach is the avatar, the narrator notes: "There he is: the man who sold you to Zariel to live out your days in the Hells.")

Gortash mocks Ketheric's "General voice" and asks if this is where they salute.

Orin adds, with characteristic bloodlust: "Salute, yes, with cleavers through his blood-starved flesh. How it crawls with failure like flies on lick-wet carrion."

Ketheric warns her she forgets herself - he has played his part.

Gortash counters that while Ketheric built an army, the Astral Prism remains missing - a rogue True Soul has been flaunting it under his nose, and he "almost missed it" (or "ran from them" if the player escaped Moonrise).

Ketheric claims Balthazar will deliver the Prism soon and asks them to cease the distractions.

Gortash pushes further: "The distractions have been *yours*, Ketheric. Perhaps we never should have dug your daughter up."

At the mention of his daughter, Ketheric lunges at Gortash with his fist raised - but Orin is suddenly there, a knife to Ketheric's chest.

Gortash grins: "So you *haven't* lost your edge. But you're still not as sharp as Orin is, I wager."

He muses about "the slayer against the undying one" - that would be fun to watch.

Orin's excitement builds: "His cryptbreath sings to my sinews, again again againagainagain!" But she reluctantly sheathes her knife - "he must lead the murdermarch to Baldur's Grave."

## The Elder Brain Revealed

Gortash raises his gauntlet, displaying a glowing Netherstone: "If the weapon is truly in your grasp, Ketheric, might I suggest closing your fist?"

He and Orin turn to the brine pool, holding their Netherstones aloft:

Gortash: "The edict of Bane."
Orin: "The lash of Bhaal."

From the boiling brine pool, a MASSIVE SHAPE emerges - the Elder Brain, tentacles writhing. Ketheric reluctantly complies, displaying his own Netherstone:

Ketheric: "The testament of Myrkul."

A crown atop the Brain sparks with the same light as the three Netherstones.

The Dream Guardian speaks telepathically: "An elder brain... one of the cruellest and most powerful creatures in existence, enslaved by mere mortals."

## Gale's Moment of Crisis

If Gale has not disarmed his orb, the sight of the Crown triggers a pivotal moment.

**If Gale is the Avatar:**

The narrator describes the Crown striking the player like lightning - an artefact of unrivalled power that could change everything: "Your own course. Your own life. The destiny of worlds." But this is also the chance to heed Mystra's call and end the Absolute.

**If Gale is a Companion:**

**Gale:** "Look at that crown. It radiates with power unlike anything I've ever seen. To have it... to hold... If only I could..."

**Gale:** "But I can't... This is it. I must do as Mystra commands."

### The Player's Response

If the player tells Gale he cannot condemn them to death:

**Gale:** "What choice do I have? More than just a goddess counts on my courage: whole worlds hang in the balance."

**If partnered with Gale** (the player says "You could choose me, the one who loves you"):

**Gale:** "I love you too. Much more than myself. More even than Mystra."

**Gale:** "Very well. Whether I condemn this world or not: I choose you."

**If dating Gale** (the player pleads it can't end like this):

**Gale:** "I... I have no desire to end your life, you know that."

**Gale:** "To end it... To struggle on... It is a grave choice you're making for us both, but if it must be so - very well, I'll stand down to stand by you."

**If neither romantic** (the player says "Trust me, we'll find another way"):

**Gale:** "I do trust you. More than myself right now. Perhaps even more than Mystra."

**If the player agrees to let Gale detonate:**

**Gale:** "One last gust of Weave. One last gale to end them all."

The Dream Guardian screams "NO!" as the bomb detonates, destroying Moonrise Towers and the Elder Brain - but unleashing a plague of uncontrolled illithids upon the Sword Coast. "It is an ending, of sorts. Though not the one destiny had in store for you."

## Duke Ravengard's Fate

Gortash turns attention to their "guest" - Duke Ulder Ravengard, bound near the brine pool.

Gortash: "Behold, Duke Ravengard: the Absolute!"

Ravengard prays: "*Helm preserve us...*"

Orin leans into his ear: "You wag your wordflap in vain, Ulderling. Once the worm holds the whip, your shredded flesh will serve us."

The Elder Brain extends a tentacle with a tadpole, pressing it against Ravengard's eye. He collapses, twitching.

If Wyll is present:

**Wyll:** "Shit, no - father!"

(The narrator notes Wyll freezes at the sight of his own father being infected.)

## The Departure

Gortash claps his hands: "Now! It's really time we were going."

He instructs Ketheric to catch up with the army once he's retrieved the "weapon" (the Astral Prism), adding mockingly: "And Ketheric - do try not to sulk. You're supposed to be the fearsome General, come to conquer the city."

With a final jab: "And I am the hero who will save it."

The Elder Brain plane-shifts away with Gortash, Orin, and the infected Ravengard. The Absolute's voice booms: "*It is time, faithful ones. March on Baldur's Gate. We go to prepare the way.*"

The army begins marching, nautiloids following the glowing brain toward the city.
