During the intimate scene with the drow twins at Sharess' Caress, both Astarion and Gale have extensive character-revealing dialogue.

## Astarion's Confidence

When approaching the encounter:

**Astarion:** "All right sweethearts. You dare to dance with a professional, you'll get your desire."

**Astarion:** "I wish... to drink. And to be drunk."

### As Vampire Lord

**Astarion:** "My fair consort, I can't wait to dine upon this four-course meal with you."

**Astarion:** "Just a figure of speech. I promise not to bite down to the bone."

### Flirtatious Lines

**Astarion:** "You haven't earned the right to stare at me like that."

**Astarion:** "I can't help myself - you look so *delicious*."

**Astarion:** "None as beautiful as me."

**Astarion:** "I hope you like a kiss with teeth, druid."

## Gale's Hilarious Projection

Gale sends a magical projection of himself instead of attending in person:

**Gale:** "Hello! I'm here on behalf of Gale of Waterdeep to participate in this evening's activities. He would like me to assure you all that I am anatomically accurate."

**Gale:** "I am involved! I'm taking notes. Making observations."

**Gale:** "My word."

**Gale:** "I'll enjoy myself well enough from back here! You go on and do... the rutting or what have you."

**Companion Interjections:**

**Astarion:** "All right sweethearts. You dare to dance with a professional, you'll get your desire."

**Astarion:** "My fair consort, I can't wait to dine upon this four-course meal with you."

**Astarion:** "I can't help myself - you look so *delicious*."

**Gale:** "Hello! I'm here on behalf of Gale of Waterdeep to participate in this evening's activities. He would like me to assure you all that I am anatomically accurate."

**Gale:** "I'll enjoy myself well enough from back here! You go on and do... the rutting or what have you."

**Note:** This scene brilliantly contrasts both characters' approaches to intimacy. Astarion is confident and in control - his "dance with a professional" refers to his 200 years of experience as Cazador's lure. His Vampire Lord lines are predatory ("dine upon this four-course meal"), while spawn Astarion is more playful. Gale's solution - sending an "anatomically accurate" projection while he "takes notes" - is peak wizard awkwardness. His "the rutting or what have you" shows scholarly detachment even from his own participation. It's one of the game's funniest scenes.
