When preparing to execute prisoners at Moonrise Towers while infiltrating as True Souls, Astarion shows his eagerness.

## Astarion's Readiness

When asked if they're ready:

**Astarion:** "You're not the only one. We've waited long enough."

**Astarion:** "You, maybe. I'm more than ready."

**Companion Interjections:**

**Astarion:** "You're not the only one. We've waited long enough."

**Astarion:** "You, maybe. I'm more than ready."

**Note:** These lines can be read two ways: either Astarion is genuinely enthusiastic about violence, or he's selling their cover as True Souls. Given his character, it's likely both - he can be pragmatic about necessary violence while also not being bothered by it. His "more than ready" shows confidence, possibly even anticipation.
