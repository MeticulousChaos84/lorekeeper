When meeting Lorroakan at Sorcerous Sundries, Gale has extensive dialogue that varies based on whether he's pursuing the Crown of Karsus or has been dissuaded from that path.

## If Gale Wants the Crown of Karsus

When Gale is still pursuing godhood:

**Gale:** "He would seek the power of gods for the pettiest of reasons - his own gratification. At least I seek them for the better of all."

When Lorroakan catches him murmuring:

**Gale:** "Pitying, not insolent. You chase one power without knowing an even greater one lies within my reach - the Crown of Karsus."

**Gale:** "Once we acquire it, your ambitions will be dwarfed. I will be able to stand against Mystra, and wrest her powers from her. For the betterment of *all*."

When Lorroakan doubts him:

**Gale:** "Perhaps *you* could not. But Netheril's power is in my blood, and Mystra? I know her in ways that most mortals can only dream of."

**Gale:** "There is no need for me to bark. My actions will speak for themselves, in time."

## If Gale Was Dissuaded from the Crown

When the player convinced Gale to abandon his ambitions:

**Gale:** "Perhaps it was indeed wise to dissuade me from the Crown of Karsus - a jumped-up wizard drunk on promises of power is not enviable company."

**Gale:** "Nothing at all, friend. I was merely admiring your ambition."

When Lorroakan mocks him about Mystra:

**Gale:** "I'm my own man. I make my own choices."

## If Gale Quietly Pursues the Crown

**Gale:** "Let him chase his prize if he wishes. We know of an even greater one that he is blind to - *the Crown.*"

**Gale:** "Nothing, friend. Just a little trapped wind - I'm sure you understand."

## Warning About Lorroakan

**Gale:** "Ambitious wizards and vast power can be a dangerous mix. Careful what you share with him."

## Astarion's Reactions

When the player agrees to hand over the Nightsong:

**Astarion:** "Quick to hand someone over, aren't you?"

**Astarion:** "I do admire your directness, though. Quick and to the point."

**Companion Interjections:**

**Gale:** "Once we acquire it, your ambitions will be dwarfed. I will be able to stand against Mystra, and wrest her powers from her. For the betterment of *all*."

**Gale:** "Perhaps *you* could not. But Netheril's power is in my blood, and Mystra? I know her in ways that most mortals can only dream of."

**Gale:** "I'm my own man. I make my own choices."

**Astarion:** "Quick to hand someone over, aren't you?"

**Note:** This scene is a masterclass in showing Gale's different paths. Crown-seeking Gale is arrogant and grandiose - his "for the betterment of all" rings hollow given his personal vendetta against Mystra. His claim about knowing Mystra "in ways that most mortals can only dream of" is both technically true (they were lovers) and deeply inappropriate boasting. Dissuaded Gale is self-aware and humble - recognizing in Lorroakan the "jumped-up wizard" he nearly became himself. Astarion's reactions about handing someone over are pointed - given his own history of being "handed over" to Cazador for 200 years, he has strong feelings about trading people for power.
