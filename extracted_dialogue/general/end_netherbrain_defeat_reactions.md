During the final confrontation with the Netherbrain, companions react when the player successfully dominates it.

## Companion Reactions to Victory

After the Netherbrain's defeat, one companion (randomly selected) reacts:

**Astarion:** "Sweet hells! Well, that's what you get."

**Gale:** "Hells. His mind crumpled like a piece of parchment."

Other companions:
- Lae'zel: "Again! The Grand Design must not come to pass!"
- Shadowheart: "Hells. Talk about wiping the smirk off his face..."
- Wyll: "Helm almighty!"
- Karlach: "Hahaha! Oh wow. Yes. That's what you get, fucker."
- Halsin: "Oak Father preserve us. That scheming brain is but a feast for the worms now..."
- Jaheira: "Huh. That great big brain of his got him in the end."

**Companion Interjections:**

**Astarion:** "Sweet hells! Well, that's what you get."

**Gale:** "Hells. His mind crumpled like a piece of parchment."

**Note:** Gale's poetic imagery ("crumpled like a piece of parchment") reflects his scholarly nature even in moments of triumph. Astarion's response is pure schadenfreude - after everything they've endured, he savors watching their enemy fall.
