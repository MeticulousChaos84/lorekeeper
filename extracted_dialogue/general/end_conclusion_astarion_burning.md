After the tadpoles are destroyed, Astarion (if he remained a spawn) loses the protection that allowed him to walk in sunlight. One companion (randomly selected) warns him he's burning.

## Companion Warnings

**Gale:** "I think it might be time for you to find a shadier spot, my friend. If I'm not mistaken, you're beginning to burn..."

**Wyll:** "Shit. Astarion, you need to get out of the light."

**Halsin:** "Astarion - the sun is burning you. To shelter, quick!"

**Jaheira:** "Astarion! Get out of the sun!"

**Minsc:** "Hide, Astarion! I do not think you are going to tan!"

**Minthara:** "What is that enticing aroma? Ah - I do believe the sun is cooking poor Astarion."

**Karlach:** "*Oh no - Astarion, you're burning up. Take cover, quickly!*"

**Companion Interjections:**

**Gale:** "I think it might be time for you to find a shadier spot, my friend. If I'm not mistaken, you're beginning to burn..."

**Note:** This scene is the bittersweet cost of Astarion's victory. By destroying the tadpole, he saves the world but loses the ability to walk in sunlight - something he'd experienced for the first time in 200 years. Each companion's warning reflects their personality: Gale is gentle and euphemistic ("find a shadier spot"), Minthara is darkly amused ("enticing aroma"), while Karlach is immediately concerned. If Astarion had ascended to Vampire Lord, he wouldn't have this problem - showing one of the temptations of the evil path.
