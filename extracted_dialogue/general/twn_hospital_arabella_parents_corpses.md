When visiting the hospital morgue and encountering the corpses of Arabella's parents, companions react to the tragic discovery.

## Recognizing Arabella's Father

**Astarion:** "Is that Arabella's father she's tending? Our little idol thief has some terrible luck."

**Gale:** "This corpse... It's Arabella's father. The horror of his end I daren't contemplate."

## Recognizing Arabella's Mother

**Astarion:** "Is that Arabella's mother she's tending? Our little idol thief has some terrible luck."

**Gale:** "This corpse... It's Arabella's mother. The horror of her end I daren't contemplate."

**Companion Interjections:**

**Astarion:** "Our little idol thief has some terrible luck."

**Gale:** "The horror of his/her end I daren't contemplate."

**Note:** These reactions perfectly contrast Astarion and Gale's approaches to tragedy. Astarion's "terrible luck" is characteristically detached - almost callous in its understatement, referring to her as "our little idol thief" (the stolen Idol of Silvanus incident) rather than by name. His tone distances him from the emotional weight. Gale, by contrast, is more openly empathetic - his "daren't contemplate" shows he's trying not to imagine the gruesome details of how they died. Both are sad discoveries that foreshadow the player having to break the news to orphaned Arabella.
