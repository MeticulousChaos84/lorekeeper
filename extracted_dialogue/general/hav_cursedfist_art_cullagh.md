# Last Light Inn - Art Cullagh and Thaniel

**Starting Node:** Various

At Last Light Inn, the player finds Art Cullagh, a Flaming Fist soldier trapped in a catatonic state, singing fragments of a song about "Thaniel." Companions recognize this name from Halsin's mission.

## Gale's Insight on Memory

When the player identifies the tune as an original composition:

**Fist J'ehlar:** "Maybe he was a musician."

**Gale:** "Music's a powerful source of memories. We might be able to bring him around if we find what he used to play."

## Companions Recognize Thaniel

When Art sings "*Mm, mm, Thaniel and me are... Climb, climb, climbing up a tree...*", one companion (randomly selected) speaks up:

**Gale:** "Thaniel? That's the very lad - or spiriti - that Halsin needs to find."

**Astarion:** "Thaniel? Didn't Halsin mention him? Something something spirit of the land?"

Other companions' versions:
- Lae'zel: "'Thaniel', he said. Halsin's young target, yes?"
- Shadowheart: "Thaniel? We've heard that name before - from Halsin. That's who he's looking for."
- Karlach: "That name rings a bell. Halsin mentioned a Thaniel, right? Part of his 'spirit of the land' mission."
- Wyll: "Thaniel? I know the name. Halsin spoke of him - something about the 'spirit of the land'."

## After Thaniel is Saved

**Art Cullagh:** "Now that Thaniel's all right, Halsin can banish the curse from this place. Thaniel spoke it - and now it's coming true."

**Art Cullagh:** "I trust you and Halsin to help him. He's a sweet soul, Thaniel. I can't wait for you to meet him."

**Companion Interjections:**

**Gale:** "Music's a powerful source of memories. We might be able to bring him around if we find what he used to play."

**Gale:** "Thaniel? That's the very lad - or spiriti - that Halsin needs to find."

**Astarion:** "Thaniel? Didn't Halsin mention him? Something something spirit of the land?"

**Note:** Gale's suggestion about music as memory shows his knowledge of how the mind works. Astarion's casual "something something" response is typical of his half-attentive style when topics don't directly concern him. This scene is a key part of the Shadow Curse questline.
