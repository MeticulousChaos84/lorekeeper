Upon entering the Ketheric boss chamber in the Colony, the party witnesses a cinematic of the Chosen Three (Ketheric, Orin, Gortash) discussing their plans. Ketheric tadpoles Duke Ravengard, and the Elder Brain is revealed wearing the Crown of Karsus. If Gale is present, he has a major decision point.

## Gale's First Sight of the Crown

### If Gale is the Avatar

**Narrator:** "*The sight of the crown atop the elder brain strikes you like lightning. Never before have you beheld an artefact of such unrivalled power.*"

**Narrator:** "*You realise that it could change everything. Your own course. Your own life. The destiny of worlds.*"

**Narrator:** "*But here, in this very moment lies your chance to heed Mystra's call. This must be it: the end of the Absolute.*"

### Gale's Player Choices (as Avatar)

**Player:** "*It's one thing to sacrifice yourself, but you will not sacrifice your friends. You will wait - there will be another chance.*"

**Player:** "*Or the beginning of something else... You will not die today.*"

**Narrator:** "*The orb senses your hesitation. It shudders within you - longing for something, though you cannot tell what.*"

**Narrator:** "*A prickling dread rises along your spine - you have disobeyed Mystra. Again. If you survive this, there will be consequences.*"

### If the Player Chooses to Detonate

**Player:** "*Obey your goddess. Detonate the orb. Destroy the Absolute.*"

**Narrator:** "*Beneath the smoking ashes of Moonrise Towers, the elder brain lies destroyed. But what of the tadpoles it commanded?*"

**Narrator:** "*Freed of the Absolute's control, they will complete their transformations. A plague of illithids will soon descend on the Sword Coast, enslaving all they do not infect.*"

**Narrator:** "*It is an ending, of sorts. Though not the one destiny had in store for you.*"

## Gale as Companion

### Gale's Temptation and Resolve

**Gale:** "Look at that crown. It radiates with power unlike anything I've ever seen. To have it... to hold... If only I could..."

**Gale:** "But I can't... This is it. I must do as Mystra commands."

### Player Convincing Gale to Stop

**Player:** "Gale, you *cannot* do this. You can't condemn us to death."

**Gale:** "What choice do I have? More than just a goddess counts on my courage: whole worlds hang in the balance."

### If Romanced

**Player:** "You could choose me, the one who loves you. We can find another way together."

**Gale:** "I love you too. Much more than myself. More even than Mystra."

**Gale:** "Very well. Whether I condemn this world or not: I choose you."

### If Dating

**Player:** "Please, Gale. It can't end like this. We can find another way. Together."

**Gale:** "I... I have no desire to end your life, you know that."

**Gale:** "To end it... To struggle on... It is a grave choice you're making for us both, but if it must be so - very well, I'll stand down to stand by you."

### Other Persuasion Options

**Player:** "Trust me, Gale. We'll find another way."

**Gale:** "I do trust you. More than myself right now. Perhaps even more than Mystra."

**Player:** "Stand down! This isn't your decision to make."

### If Gale Detonates

**Player:** "You're right... we truly have no other choice. This is it, then - the end of ends."

**Gale:** "One last gust of Weave. One last gale to end them all."

**Companion Interjections:**

**Gale:** "Look at that crown. It radiates with power unlike anything I've ever seen. To have it... to hold... If only I could..."

**Gale:** "But I can't... This is it. I must do as Mystra commands."

**Gale:** "What choice do I have? More than just a goddess counts on my courage: whole worlds hang in the balance."

**Gale:** "I love you too. Much more than myself. More even than Mystra."

**Gale:** "Very well. Whether I condemn this world or not: I choose you."

**Gale:** "I do trust you. More than myself right now. Perhaps even more than Mystra."

**Gale:** "One last gust of Weave. One last gale to end them all."

**Note:** This scene is the first major test of Gale's arc. His immediate temptation ("To have it... to hold...") shows his hunger for power, while his resolve to detonate shows his commitment to Mystra. The romance path is particularly poignant - "More even than Mystra" is a massive statement from a man who literally loved a goddess. His pun "One last gale to end them all" shows his wit even facing death.
