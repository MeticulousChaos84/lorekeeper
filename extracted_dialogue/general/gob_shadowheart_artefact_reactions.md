When the Voice of the Absolute attempts to command the party in the Goblin Camp but Shadowheart's artefact repels it, companions react to the mysterious protection.

## Reactions to the Artefact's Power

After the artefact shields the party:

**Astarion:** "I don't know what that toy of hers is, but I'm glad it's on our side."

**Gale:** "That's an unusual artefact you have there, Shadowheart. A most unlikely protector..."

## Learning Shadowheart Worships Shar

When Shadowheart's faith is revealed:

**Gale:** "You worship Shar? Blimey. She and my beloved Mystra are not exactly friends."

## Respecting Shadowheart's Privacy

When the player asks about Shadowheart's secrets:

**Astarion:** "Heavens forbid. We're all entitled to our secrets."

**Companion Interjections:**

**Astarion:** "I don't know what that toy of hers is, but I'm glad it's on our side."

**Gale:** "That's an unusual artefact you have there, Shadowheart. A most unlikely protector..."

**Gale:** "You worship Shar? Blimey. She and my beloved Mystra are not exactly friends."

**Astarion:** "Heavens forbid. We're all entitled to our secrets."

**Note:** These reactions reveal character perspectives on secrets and faith. Gale's recognition of the artefact as "unusual" shows his magical expertise, while his "Blimey" at learning she worships Shar is charmingly informal. His mention that Shar and Mystra "are not exactly friends" is understated - they're mortal enemies. Astarion's defense of Shadowheart's secrets ("We're all entitled to our secrets") reflects his own desire for privacy about his vampirism - he empathizes with her guarded nature.
