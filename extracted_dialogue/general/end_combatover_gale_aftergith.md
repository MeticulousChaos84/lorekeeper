After the githyanki have departed, Gale (as origin character) faces his ultimate choice: claim the Crown of Karsus to become a god, give it to Mystra for redemption, or celebrate with companions. Other companions react to his decision.

## Gale Choosing Godhood

**Player (as Gale):** "I will not be joining you. I've a Crown to reforge, and perhaps - a chance to become a god."

### Companion Reactions to Godhood Path

**Astarion (Vampire Lord):** "Such ambition - you make me look positively humble."

**Astarion (Not Ascended):** "I can't fault your ambition. I don't know if I'd pick a fight with Mystra myself, but more power to you."

**Lae'zel:** "Wield a god's power, and expect the full weight of opposing gods' wrath. I expect Mystra will be the first you contend with."

**Shadowheart:** "Ambitious - don't let Mystra hear you say that."

**Wyll:** "An ambitious enterprise. One I doubt Mystra will stand for."

**Halsin:** "A lofty goal. Be careful of Mystra - she shall not care to have a new rival."

**Jaheira:** "A humble task ahead, then. And one in which your Mystra will no doubt wish you well."

**Minthara:** "I wish you well. And if Mystra stands in your way, call on me, wizard. I have acquired a taste for killing gods."

**Minsc:** "Minsc and Boo wish you well, my friend - but think this is perhaps the way into Mystra's bad books, not back into her heart."

**Karlach:** "*If anyone can, it's you, Gale. Whether you should is a question you might consider, though.*"

### Narrator on Godhood

**Narrator:** "*The very air around you thrums with anticipation, and fear. Can you really handle such power, such authority?*"

**Narrator:** "*There's only one way to find out.*"

**Narrator:** "*Your allies seek to celebrate, but they know not what is to come. Yours will be a different future - a glorious one, and you will walk it alone.*"

## Gale Giving Crown to Mystra

**Player (as Gale):** "It's time I leave you. I must reforge the Crown. If I offer it to Mystra, perhaps she'll cure me of the orb."

### Companion Reactions to Mystra Path

**Astarion (Vampire Lord):** "A little demeaning to go running to your god after everything we've achieved, but if that's what it takes to survive..."

**Astarion (Not Ascended):** "Of course, your *other* condition. But if anything can convince your god to do what's right, the Crown can."

**Lae'zel:** "Only a cruel god would refuse you. May Mystra's wisdom prevail over her enmity."

**Shadowheart (Enemy of Shar):** "I'm no longer one to take the mercy of goddesses for granted... but I hope Mystra smiles upon you."

**Shadowheart:** "Perhaps. I can't speak to the qualities of Mystra, but I can *certainly* speak to those of her servant."

**Wyll:** "I'm sure it will come to pass. Find me when it's done - I'll want to hear your story."

**Halsin:** "Of course she will. The world has no need for a goddess who would hesitate at such a request from her champion. I hope to see you again, Gale."

**Jaheira:** "A grand enough gesture to win back her good graces, I think. I wish you luck, wizard."

**Minthara:** "You are a wise enough man to know that one should not expect kindness from the gods, Gale."

**Minsc:** "Minsc thinks she is owing you this much, at least. We look forward to your return - healed and pure of chest!"

**Karlach:** "*I hope she does. And we see each other again soon, both less explosive than ever before.*"

### Narrator on Mystra Path

**Narrator:** "*Perhaps Mystra will recognise you for your humility, perhaps not.*"

**Narrator:** "*Of one thing you may be assured - the world will be safe from the Crown's power, thanks to you - Gale of Waterdeep, the wizard who defeated a Netherbrain.*"

## Celebrations and What Next

### Companions Suggesting Celebration

**Astarion (Vampire Lord):** "Well, that's enough world-saving for one day. If any other existential threats appear, someone else can handle it - we are finding a tavern and celebrating."

**Astarion (Not Ascended):** "Well, if that's everything - and I sincerely hope it is - we should find a tavern and celebrate. We've certainly earned it."

**Lae'zel:** "I suggest we take a moment to rest, recuperate, and drink the nectars of victory."

**Shadowheart:** "I think a celebration is in order. It's the least we deserve."

**Wyll:** "A suggestion, if I may: a celebration. I know I could use a few sips of good ale."

**Halsin:** "Perhaps it's time for a celebration. We have earned it."

**Jaheira:** "Would anyone else like to sit down? Lie down? Drink until we fall down, perhaps?"

**Minthara:** "That we have survived is a miracle. I propose we celebrate with whatever filth passes as wine in this city."

**Minsc:** "No one else wishes to say it? Very well, then. DRINKING!"

**Karlach:** "*I think we've earned a celebration. Don't you?*"

### Companions Asking About Gale's Plans

**Astarion (Vampire Lord):** "Now, Gale, you're looking decidedly 'thinky'. I hope you're not about to spoil this excellent, excellent plan."

**Astarion (Not Ascended):** "Although it seems not everyone is in the mood to celebrate. What's happening in that head of yours, Gale?"

**Shadowheart:** "But what about you, Gale? What will you do now...?"

**Wyll:** "Gale - what about you? Where do you go from here?"

**Halsin:** "But what awaits you, Gale? Your path ahead is... unclear."

**Jaheira:** "Though, first - Gale. What is it you plan to do next?"

**Minthara:** "You seem distracted, wizard. I can no longer spy your thoughts - so speak them."

**Minsc:** "Though first - what of you, wizard?"

**Karlach:** "*What do you say, Gale?*"

## Gale's Other Options

**Player (as Gale):** "You go on ahead. I miss Waterdeep, and I'd like to go home."

**Player (as Gale):** "A celebration sounds ideal. Whatever time I have left, I'd like to spend it with you."

**Companion Interjections:**

**Astarion (Vampire Lord):** "Such ambition - you make me look positively humble."

**Astarion (Not Ascended):** "I can't fault your ambition. I don't know if I'd pick a fight with Mystra myself, but more power to you."

**Astarion (Vampire Lord):** "A little demeaning to go running to your god after everything we've achieved, but if that's what it takes to survive..."

**Astarion (Not Ascended):** "Of course, your *other* condition. But if anything can convince your god to do what's right, the Crown can."

**Astarion (Vampire Lord):** "Well, that's enough world-saving for one day. If any other existential threats appear, someone else can handle it - we are finding a tavern and celebrating."

**Astarion (Not Ascended):** "Well, if that's everything - and I sincerely hope it is - we should find a tavern and celebrate. We've certainly earned it."

**Astarion (Vampire Lord):** "Now, Gale, you're looking decidedly 'thinky'. I hope you're not about to spoil this excellent, excellent plan."

**Note:** This scene brilliantly showcases how companions view Gale differently. Vampire Lord Astarion respects the ambition ("you make me look humble") while non-ascended Astarion is more cautious. Minthara's "I have acquired a taste for killing gods" is darkly hilarious. The contrast between paths - Gale walking alone to godhood vs celebrating with friends - perfectly captures his character's central tension between ambition and connection.
