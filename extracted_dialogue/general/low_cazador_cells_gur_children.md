In Cazador's Palace, Astarion encounters the Gur children he captured for his master decades ago. They have been turned into vampire spawn and imprisoned in the cells. This is one of Astarion's most emotionally devastating scenes.

## Recognition

When Astarion sees the child:

**Astarion:** "Oh Gods, it can't be..."

## Confronting His Past

When the child asks if he remembers capturing them:

**Astarion:** "Ah. Ah-hah... yes, now that you mention it, I may have done... that."

**Astarion:** "Don't look at me like that - Cazador's orders."

**Astarion:** "Quite the deviation from my usual routine, of course. Capture, not lure. I didn't bring them in with sweetrolls or anything."

**Astarion:** "I really forgot about them, felt nothing the moment I handed them over to him."

## Processing His Guilt

**Astarion:** "I was in the prime of my life when I was turned."

**Astarion:** "Everything was taken from *me*, too."

When asked if he deserves punishment:

**Astarion:** "Of course I deserve it, but the countless others they'd feed from..."

## Shame and Deflection

**Astarion:** "I just... I never want to see these little scraps of misery again. The world doesn't need to know my shame."

When asked how many suffered:

**Astarion:** "Enough to break your heart."

**Astarion:** "Maybe I am. Maybe that's what I have to do."

## Practical Advice

**Astarion:** "Might I recommend acquiring a taste for rats? They won't sate your appetite, but they help with the hunger."

## Other Reactions

**Astarion:** "I couldn't have put it less delicately if I'd tried."

**Astarion:** "Thirsty little brats, aren't they?"

**Astarion:** "I suppose there's a good chance they will."

**Astarion:** "What use is it, though? They're lost, ravenous, feral. They'd attack any mortal on sight."

**Astarion:** "All these people were ruined because of me."

**Companion Interjections:**

**Astarion:** "Oh Gods, it can't be..."

**Astarion:** "Don't look at me like that - Cazador's orders."

**Astarion:** "I really forgot about them, felt nothing the moment I handed them over to him."

**Astarion:** "Everything was taken from *me*, too."

**Astarion:** "Of course I deserve it, but the countless others they'd feed from..."

**Astarion:** "I just... I never want to see these little scraps of misery again. The world doesn't need to know my shame."

**Astarion:** "Enough to break your heart."

**Astarion:** "All these people were ruined because of me."

**Note:** This scene is devastating for Astarion's character. His initial denial ("I may have done... that") shifts to deflection ("Cazador's orders") before crumbling into genuine guilt. The line "I really forgot about them, felt nothing" reveals how deeply his humanity was suppressed under Cazador's control. "Everything was taken from me, too" shows he's still trying to see himself as victim, while "All these people were ruined because of me" shows him finally accepting responsibility. His practical advice about rats shows he's trying to help despite his guilt. "The world doesn't need to know my shame" reveals his deep fear of being seen as a monster.
