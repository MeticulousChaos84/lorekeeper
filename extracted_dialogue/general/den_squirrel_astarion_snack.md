In camp or the Druid Grove, the player encounters an aggressive squirrel named Timber. If the player kills the squirrel, Astarion has a uniquely disappointed reaction.

## Astarion's Reaction to Killing the Squirrel

When the player successfully punches the squirrel to death:

**Astarion:** "No! What did you do?!"

**Astarion:** "Oh, it's everywhere. You ruined a perfectly good snack."

**Companion Interjections:**

**Astarion:** "No! What did you do?!"

**Astarion:** "Oh, it's everywhere. You ruined a perfectly good snack."

**Note:** This comedic scene reveals Astarion's vampiric pragmatism in an unexpected way. While other companions might object to needless violence, Astarion's complaint is purely practical - the player ruined his meal. His distressed "No!" suggests he was actually looking forward to drinking from the squirrel, and "it's everywhere" refers to the wasted blood. A perfect example of his dark humor and different perspective on death.
