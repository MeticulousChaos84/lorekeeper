In the Githyanki Creche infirmary, the player discovers the Zaith'isk - a device the githyanki claim can purge mind flayer tadpoles. When the player considers using it, companions react with varying levels of concern.

## Considering the Device

When asked about using the Zaith'isk:

**Astarion:** "I'm all for it, but... well, you first."

**Gale:** "Well... could go either way. But we came this far - should at least try."

## During the Procedure

The device is actually designed to kill the user rather than cure them. As the machine begins to malfunction and hurt the player, companions cry out in alarm:

### First Warning:

**Astarion:** "What are you doing? Turn it off!"

**Gale:** "There has to be a way to stop this thing!"

**Wyll:** "Enough, already - we need to stop this thing!"

**Karlach:** "There's got to be some way to stop this thing!"

### Final Warning (device reaching critical levels):

**Astarion:** "It's too much, you can't take it. Get out of there, now!"

**Gale:** "That's no cure - it's going to kill you. Get out!"

**Wyll:** "Hells - I've got a bad feeling about this."

**Karlach:** "This can't be right. That thing's going to kill you - move, now!"

**Companion Interjections:**

**Astarion:** "What are you doing? Turn it off!"

**Astarion:** "It's too much, you can't take it. Get out of there, now!"

**Gale:** "Well... could go either way. But we came this far - should at least try."

**Gale:** "There has to be a way to stop this thing!"

**Gale:** "That's no cure - it's going to kill you. Get out!"

**Note:** Only one companion speaks at each point (randomly selected from those present). The device is actually a trap designed to kill the user.
