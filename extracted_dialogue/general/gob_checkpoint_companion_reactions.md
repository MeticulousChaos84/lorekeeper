When encountering Sentinel Olak at the goblin camp checkpoint, companions have reactions to the situation and the mention of Volo being kept "in the pits."

## Gale's Advice on Diplomacy

When first confronting the goblin guard:

**Gale:** "Let's try to be diplomatic, shall we? Goblins don't come by the handfuls, but by the dozens."

## Reactions to Volo's Location

When learning Volo is being kept "in the pits":

**Gale:** "'Down in the pits', no less. Sounds ominous among creatures that love bloodsports. Better step to it."

**Astarion:** "If this is the state of their camp, how bad must 'the pits' be?"

**Companion Interjections:**

**Gale:** "Let's try to be diplomatic, shall we? Goblins don't come by the handfuls, but by the dozens."

**Gale:** "'Down in the pits', no less. Sounds ominous among creatures that love bloodsports. Better step to it."

**Astarion:** "If this is the state of their camp, how bad must 'the pits' be?"

**Note:** These reactions show the companions' different approaches to the goblin camp. Gale's warning about goblin numbers is pure pragmatism - he's not against violence, but unnecessary violence against a numerically superior foe. His comment about "bloodsports" shows his scholarly knowledge of goblin culture. Astarion's remark is characteristically disdainful - comparing the already-disgusting camp to whatever horrors await in "the pits" is both valid concern and aristocratic contempt for the goblins' living conditions.
