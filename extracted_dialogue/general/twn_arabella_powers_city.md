In Baldur's Gate, the player encounters Arabella again - the tiefling girl they saved from Kagha in Act 1. She has awakened sorcerous powers and is searching for her parents (who died in the Shadow Cursed Lands).

## If the Player Tells Arabella to Leave

One companion (randomly selected) comments:

**Astarion:** "I do like her spirit. I don't like her chances, but her spirit? Excellent."

**Gale:** "That was rather inhospitable. She could well die out there, we should go after her."

Other companions' versions:
- Shadowheart: "I'm not sure I like her chances out here, even if she does have powers."
- Wyll: "Sending a child out there to die? Damned spiteful. Figured you better than that."

## If Persuasion to Join Camp Fails

If the player fails to convince Arabella to come to camp, she runs off alone:

**Approval:** Everyone -1 to -3, Minthara +1

**Astarion:** "Pity, I kind of liked her. Oh well."

**Gale:** "Stubborn little tyke! Even if she can swing a spell or two, she's going to get herself killed out here."

Other companions' versions:
- Lae'zel: "Capricious child. She almost got herself killed once. Seems she's intent on finishing the job."
- Shadowheart: "She's going to get herself killed out here, powers or not."
- Wyll: "Damn it - new powers or not, the kid's going to get herself killed."

**Companion Interjections:**

**Astarion:** "I do like her spirit. I don't like her chances, but her spirit? Excellent."

**Astarion:** "Pity, I kind of liked her. Oh well."

**Gale:** "That was rather inhospitable. She could well die out there, we should go after her."

**Gale:** "Stubborn little tyke! Even if she can swing a spell or two, she's going to get herself killed out here."

**Note:** This scene shows Astarion's typical detachment - he admires her spirit but accepts her likely death with casual "Oh well." Gale shows more concern, calling her departure "inhospitable" and urging the party to follow. If Arabella leaves, she eventually dies in the city streets.
