## Gortash

### Gortash Killed

**Gale:** Tyranny offers only two fates for the tyrant - infamy, or ignomy. I'm glad we were able to offer Gortash the latter.

---

### Gortash and Karlach (Avatar)

**Gale:** Revenge is a dish best served hot, it seems. At least when you're in charge of the menu.

---

### Gortash and Karlach (Companion)

**Gale:** Revenge is a dish best served hot, it seems. At least when Karlach is in charge of the menu. She deserves more time to enjoy her victory. Still, there's solace to be found in surrendering one's mortality in a blaze of glory. Or so I hear.

---

### Gortash - After Death (Karlach Companion)

**Gale:** No sense dawdling. Karlach has precious little time left to her - we'd do better than to waste it.

---

### Gortash Warned About Orin Impostor

**Gale:** If Gortash is to be believed, then even our camp isn't safe from Orin's influence. We might want to confirm the veracity of his claim. Or at least, clean up the mess.

---

## Orin

### Orin Shapeshifting - First Encounter

**Gale:** Orin toys with us where she could destroy us. Whatever her motivations, I hope she reveals them quickly.

---

### Orin Killed

**Gale:** Orin was a monster, whatever her form. I suppose growing up somewhere like this would make a monster of anyone.

---

### Orin Kidnapped Lae'zel

**Gale:** Lae'zel was a formidable addition to our party. Our odds without her are diminished. We should consider Orin's terms carefully, however distasteful we may find them.

---

### Orin Kidnapped Halsin

**Gale:** Halsin does not deserve to die on such a craven's altar. We should consider Orin's terms carefully, however distasteful we may find them.

---

### Orin Kidnapped Minthara

**Gale:** Orin, masquerading as Minthara... That certainly explains her vociferous antipathy towards me. Who knows how long the real Minthara has been strapped to Orin's altar? We owe it to her to bring her back safely. She would do no less for you or I.

---

### Orin Kidnapped Yenna

**Gale:** To threaten the life of a child... truly, Orin will stop at nothing.

---

### Zevlor's Body in Camp (Knew Zevlor)

**Gale:** After all he'd been through... Zevlor did not deserve such a death. It is unsettling, to know we have such eyes as Orin's upon our party. Sorry - I didn't ask why you sought me out. Do you need anything of me?

---

### Zevlor's Body in Camp (Didn't Know Zevlor)

**Gale:** A grim sight to behold when you're as bone-weary as we are. It is unsettling, to know we have such eyes as Orin's upon our party. Sorry - I didn't ask why you sought me out. Do you need anything of me?

## Aradin's Night Attack on Camp

**Gale (first line):** Well that's my chances of a beauty sleep thoroughly ruined for the evening...

**Gale (if talked to again):** You should try to get some rest. Hard to save the world if you're stifling yawns.
