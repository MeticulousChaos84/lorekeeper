## Initial Reunion

### When Gale is in the Party (With Speak with Animals)

**Tara the Tressym:** Mr Dekarios! Heavens, fancy seeing *you* here!

**Gale:** Tara! That can't be you, can it?

**Tara the Tressym:** I *have* missed you!

**Tara the Tressym:** Hunting for anything?

---

### First Trade Opportunity

**Gale:** Have you got any other magic objects you'd be willing to part with?

**Tara the Tressym:** I may, or I may not. Depends what you have to offer in return. I have very high standards, mind.

*[Trade available]*

---

### Second Trade Opportunity

**Gale:** I'd like to know if you have any other interesting objects to trade.

**Tara the Tressym:** I've a nose for the things, in fact. But I get bored of deja vu, so don't expect to see me again.

*[Trade available]*

## When Party Lacks Speak with Animals

**Tara the Tressym:** *Riaow!*

**Gale:** It appears my old friend Tara here has found some objects that might interest us. Care to trade?

*[Player can choose to see her wares or leave]*

## After Trading

### If Tara Has Joined Camp

**Tara the Tressym:** See you in camp later, hmm?

### Standard Farewell

**Tara the Tressym:** Lovely to see you, sir.

### Without Speak with Animals

**Tara the Tressym:** *Riaow!*

**Gale:** She says that will be all.

## Notes

- Tara is Gale's tressym familiar from his time in Waterdeep
- She has acquired magical items through her own adventures and is willing to trade
- The encounter can only happen once; Tara mentions she "gets bored of deja vu"
- If Tara has already joined camp (from earlier in the game), she references seeing Gale there
