## Lorroakan

### Lorroakan - Knows of Nightsong's Location

**Gale:** If that charlatan Lorroakan thinks he can best Dame Aylin, he's even more clueless than I believed. We should inform her of his delusions. No doubt she'll have great fun dispelling them.

---

### Lorroakan - Convinced Nightsong is Dead

**Gale:** As expected, Lorroakan falls short of any *true* academic standard. To believe Dame Aylin dead, based on a single subjective account? It's just... shoddy scholarship. May she correct him with all the contempt of a thousand tenured professors.

---

### Lorroakan - Nightsong Killed Him

**Gale:** Dame Aylin has little to feel sorry about - Lorroakan would have inflicted a far worse fate on her, given the chance.

---

## Endgame

### Morphic Pool - Unlocked

**Gale:** We cannot afford to lose focus now. Not when the brain is so close. We press on.

---

### Morphic Pool - Arrived

**Gale:** At last, we stand on the cusp of victory. A narrower precipice than I hoped, but it's our destiny to traverse it nonetheless. The brain will succumb, and these halls will echo with our deeds for generations. Greatness awaits.

---

### High Hall Courtyard Combat

**Gale:** We have our first victory, but we'll need more before this day is through. The momentum is with us - we must keep moving.

---

## Orpheus Choices

### Orpheus Should Transform

**Gale:** None should be forced to make such a choice. If Orpheus is willing to undergo ceremorphosis, then it is his will, and should be respected.

---

### Player Should Transform

**Gale:** The situation demands more of you than any other, but you would not become an illithid in vain. Your transformation is the missing piece. It *must* be you.

---

### Karlach Should Transform

**Gale:** Ceremorphosis is Karlach's only chance of survival. It must be her.

---

### Emperor Choice Made

**Gale:** What's done is done. No sense delaying further.

---

## Danthelon's Axe Harper Ambush

**Gale:** Even the venerable Harpers are compromised by the Absolute's poison. A grim turn of events, but one we must take in our stride.
