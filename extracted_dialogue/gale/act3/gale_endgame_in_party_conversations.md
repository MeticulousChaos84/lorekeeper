## Morphic Pool / Astral Plane - After Confrontation

### If Romanced - Relief After Netherbrain Encounter

**Gale:** You're okay - thank the heavens and hells and everything in between. I thought the brain would take you from me.

*[utter relief]*

### Brain's Reluctance

**Gale:** It seems the brain's more reluctant to let go of the crown than we anticipated. Separating the crown from that monstrosity will be harder than we imagined. It might be time to reconsider our strategy.

*[cogs beginning to whir - he might end up offering to blow himself up after this]*

## Tadpole Choice Discussion

### Initial Response

**Gale:** Quite the choice you're faced with: surrender the Netherstones to a mind flayer, or surrender your soul and become one. If you need advice, I'll do my best - though I have to say I've not much to draw on in this case. It's rather a unique predicament to have landed yourself with.

*[serious, this is a big decision]*

### When Asked for Opinion

**Player:** What do you think I should do?

**Gale:** As it stands, I see no option free of sacrifice in one form or another. So the question becomes - what are you willing to give up?

Relinquish the stones, and you place your fate in the hands of a creature whose trustworthiness is hardly guaranteed. Keep the stones, and you relinquish the very essence of your being. Your soul, your emotions, your purpose. You would lose everything, and might live with such a loss for eternity.

## After Freeing Orpheus

**Gale:** I confess, in my head I saw that going a lot less amicably. I hope our newly-freed ally proves more reliable than the last.

### If Emperor Betrayed

**Gale:** I'm not sure I ever considered the Emperor an ally, exactly, but even so, it's strange to know we're on our own at last.

---

## High Hall Interior - Final Approach

### If Romanced

**Gale:** Strolling these streets together would have been quite magical, in other circumstances. This is all a tad apocalyptic for my liking.

### General

**Gale:** The High Hall was once a beacon of promise, of wisdom, of celebration. Now... well, it's just a beacon, and for all manner of horrors. A pity.

*[referring to the fact the High Hall is on fire/wrecked]*

### When Near the Brain (Willing to Die)

**Gale:** If the path we tread were easy, there'd be a queue of fools willing to walk it. Alas, it isn't. And such grim choices must fall to us.

I trust you to know the course we must take. But my offer stands - if none wish to shoulder the illithid's burden, the orb would achieve the same ends.

## Pre-Battle Conversations

### On the Approaching Battle

**Gale:** The aura of Netheril hangs heavy in this place. The brain is close, as is the crown. As is victory, dare we begin to hope...

### If Romanced - Kiss Before Battle

**Player:** These could be our final moments. Time enough for a kiss.

*[Kiss animation]*

**Gale:** I hope that wasn't our last kiss. I'd take a thousand more if I could.

### On Confidence

**Player:** Do you think we stand a chance against the Netherbrain?

**Gale:** I'm cautiously optimistic. Though with the time left to us, and the amount still to be done, it's best we don't take anything for granted.

Who knows what shape these final moments of ours might assume? Not I. Not Mystra. Not even you. But whatever my fate might be, I'll be glad to greet it in such a close company.

---

## About the Orb - Final Check

**Player:** We'll soon be close enough for you to use the orb. How are you feeling?

**Gale:** I'd need a ream of parchment longer than an elder brain's stem to capture the tumult I feel at that particular prospect. But I'm ready, if that's the word you need to hear. If you call on me, I will not let you down.

---

## About the Crown

**Player:** What will you do when we get hold of the crown?

**Gale:** 'When?' I'm glad you have such confidence in our endeavour. I confess, my own's not constructed from such immutable materials.

### If Promised Crown to Mystra

**Gale:** I made a promise to my goddess. One I will do my best to keep. For the sake of this city, I can only hope that my best will be enough.

### If Undecided

**Gale:** I don't dare to imagine making such a decision when there's the small matter of the enormous brain beneath the crown still to overcome. Ask me again when the illithid scourge has been wiped from this city, and I'll have an answer for you. Until then - it's best not to count on anything.

---

## If Player Transformed Into Mind Flayer

**Player:** How do you like my new look?

**Gale:** I'd be lying if I said it wouldn't take some getting used to, but what can a few extra tentacles do to a bond as strong as ours?

*[not overly bothered, takes it in his stride]*

When this is all over, we'll have time enough to unpick the specifics of your new condition. Psionics alone could take months to thoroughly evaluate, not to mention the matter of your diet -

*[getting excited at the prospect of learning about your new form]*

But I'm getting ahead of myself. We've a Netherbrain to defeat. *Then* we get to the fun stuff.

*[catching himself, delaying gratification]*

---

## If Preparing to Use Orb

**Gale:** Please - I need a moment.

*[mentally preparing himself for the prospect he might die when you face the brain]*

### Or

**Gale:** Fate seems determined to make a mindflayer of you, as it would make a cataclysm of me. Make your choice - the orb will be there regardless.

*[gallows humour/grim]*

---

## Final Waiting Line

**Gale:** We've a city to save. I think it's about time we got started.

*[determined]*

## Notes

This dialogue covers Gale's mental state throughout the final act - his concern for the player if romanced, his measured assessment of impossible choices, and his resolution whether he lives or dies. The lines about High Hall show his connection to the city he's trying to save, while his interactions with a transformed player demonstrate his acceptance and intellectual curiosity even in dire circumstances.

The "kiss before battle" option and his line about hoping for a thousand more is particularly poignant given the circumstances.
