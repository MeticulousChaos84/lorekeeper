# Gale - Orin's Abduction and Impersonation

**Context:** During the first long rest in the Undercity (Act 3), Orin abducts one of the player's companions based on approval rating. If Gale is abducted, she appears in camp impersonating him and attempts to manipulate the player. This dialogue occurs when the player enters camp and finds "Gale" standing by the fire, looking lost and brooding.

**Note:** All dialogue attributed to "Gale" in this scene is actually Orin using his voice and mannerisms.

## The Deception

**Gale:** Forgive me. I was lost in my thoughts, as usual.

**Gale:** I've found myself in something of a quandary. Yours is an opinion I'd gladly hear on the matter.

### If Partnered with Gale

**Gale:** Careful. You don't know what I'm about to ask.

### Entry Variations

*The player can express willingness to help, curiosity about being valued, or interest in an intellectual discussion. Regardless of approach, or even declining to engage, "Gale" presses forward.*

**Gale:** Wait. What I have to say... well, there may not be another chance. Please.

---

## The Proposal

**Gale:** I fear our unwillingness to make difficult decisions is doing more harm than good.

**Gale:** I regret straying from Mystra's instruction. All the suffering around us, it is our fault. I am reconsidering taking a more drastic approach.

*The player questions what he means by 'drastic' or why he'd change course now.*

**Gale:** Every day we spend inching our way towards our enemies is a day we *choose* to let countless die in the Absolute's path.

*Or:*

**Gale:** My apologies. I shouldn't place my own guilt onto your shoulders. I'm afraid to say I *have* been holding back. Every. Single. Day.

*Or, if the player agrees with violence:*

**Gale:** As always, I'm grateful for your enthusiasm. And yes, it will require some amount of brutality on our part.

---

## The Orb

**Gale:** We both know the orb I carry inside me is powerful enough to burn away the Absolute's blight in an instant.

**Gale:** But what stays my hand? Obstinacy? Misplaced morals? Simple fear of dying? You?

**Gale:** The inevitable has been delayed far too long already - no more, I say. It's time to make a stand.

### If the Player Mentions the Crown of Karsus

*If the player reminds "Gale" of his interest in the Crown of Karsus, whether as a previously discussed ambition or as an alternative to self-destruction:*

**Gale:** A passing fancy, one that has lost its lustre. No - unleashing the power within me will be far more magnificent than some crown.

---

## The Justification

*The player questions whether it will work, or protests that it would kill everyone:*

**Gale:** I know how much power rests within me - enough to turn Baldur's Gate to ashes, its memory to no more than a children's fable.

**Gale:** Act now, and we take out the brain and every footsoldier in the Absolute's army. All their hatred, their bile, their violence - erased. It would finally be over.

*Or:*

**Gale:** Deadly serious. This is the burden we must carry - to condemn the few to save the many, or Baldur's Gate will only be the *first* city to fall.

**Gale:** The day will come when I lose control of the power within me anyway. There's nothing you or I can do to stop that.

**Gale:** Gods damned if I'm going to let it be for nothing. If Mystra gave me one purpose, it was this: to destroy Baldur's Gate, and the Absolute with it.

## The Revelation

### Attempting to Reason

*If the player protests:*

**Gale:** There isn't.

**Gale:** *Caeci verum videant.* (Let the blind see the truth)

*"Gale" assumes a spell-casting pose, muttering the strange incantation. He begins to glow fiercely. The player braces themselves against a brilliant flash of magic, then staggers, realizing they're unharmed. Opening their eyes, dazed, they see that instead of Gale, it is now Orin standing before them.*

---

### Challenging or Threatening

*If the player threatens him:*

**Gale:** Wouldn't I?

*Or:*

**Gale:** Kill me, and I'll destroy the city anyway.

---

### Successful Intimidation

*On a successful Intimidation check (DC 25):*

**Gale:** So quick to turn on your friends... a sure sign of an unsound mind, and a villainous heart.

*Orin transforms, revealing herself.*

---

### Successful Persuasion

*On a successful Persuasion check (DC 25):*

**Gale:** So *gentle.* You think saving him will stop the bloodshed? It *won't*.

*Orin transforms, revealing herself.*

---

### Attacking

*If the player attacks:*

**Gale:** Most foolish. Wanton violence against your dear Gale? After all, the man has a budding apocalypse tucked beside his heart - you would *provoke* it?

*The player readies their weapon, but "Gale" throws up a hand. The player hesitates.*

*Orin transforms, revealing herself.*

**Notes:**
- This dialogue represents Orin's manipulation tactics, using knowledge of Gale's insecurities about the orb and Mystra
- The real Gale has been abducted and is being held at the Temple of Bhaal
- Orin's ultimatum follows the revelation: kill Gortash, retrieve his Netherstone, and bring it to her temple, or the abducted companion dies
