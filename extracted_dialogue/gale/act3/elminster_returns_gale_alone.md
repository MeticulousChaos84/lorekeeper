# Elminster Returns - Gale Alone
**Location:** Wyrm's Crossing / Camp
**Trigger:** After completing Sorcerous Sundries and learning about the Crown of Karsus
**Context:** Elminster greets Gale after he's completed Sorcerous Sundries and learned how to reforge the Crown of Karsus, either outside the shop, or in camp. Elminster tells Gale that Mystra requires him to come speak with her in the Stormshore Tabernacle, where he will learn the truth about the orb.

---

## Encounter: Outside Sorcerous Sundries

**Weary Traveller:** Gale of Waterdeep, as I live and breathe. As do you, I'm glad to see.

### Variation: In Camp

**Weary Traveller:** I hear you've been browsing in most esteemed of emporiums, Sorcerous Sundries. Indulge my curiosity - what wonders did you discover there? *(He knows exactly what you were doing there - discovering the secret of the Crown of Karsus)*

**Gale:** The truth, Elminster. How Karsus' Crown could yet be reforged. Or destroyed, as the case may be.

**Weary Traveller:** Perhaps now you understand what is at stake here, m'boy. Though what Mystra asked of you was extreme, it was not without merit nor demanded lightly.

**Weary Traveller:** She knows you defied her, Gale. Of course she knows - she's *Mystra*.

**Weary Traveller:** She bids you come to her holy shrine in the Stormshore Tabernacle. There, she will grant you an audience at last. *(Urgent, serious - delivering the message he was bid to give to Gale)*

**Gale:** If it was up to her, I'd be a pile of ash along with the rest of the shadow-cursed lands by now. I can't imagine what she has to say to me. 'Sorry', perhaps.

**Weary Traveller:** She does not make such a gesture lightly. The hourglass measuring our time for such alternatives has but a few grains remaining. *(Grave, this reprieve is not without its dangers)*

**Weary Traveller:** If you will not hear it from me, hear it from your goddess. What truths she has to offer are for your ears alone, Gale of Waterdeep. Godspeed.

## Alternative Path: Outside the Shop

**Weary Traveller:** Tell me, what curiosities did you discover within the walls of this esteemed emporium? *(He knows exactly what you were doing there - discovering the secret of the Crown of Karsus)*

### Response: A Way to Destroy the Absolute

**Gale:** A way to destroy the Absolute without using the orb. I hope.

**Weary Traveller:** You have learned the truth of the enemy we face. The Crown of Karsus, the very tool with which its eponymous creator unmade magic itself.

**Weary Traveller:** Perhaps now you understand what is at stake here, m'boy. Though what Mystra asked of you was extreme, it was not without merit nor demanded lightly.

**Weary Traveller:** She knows you defied her, Gale. Of course she knows - she's *Mystra*.

**Weary Traveller:** She bids you come to her holy shrine in the Stormshore Tabernacle. There, she will grant you an audience at last. *(Urgent, serious - delivering the message he was bid to give to Gale)*

**Gale:** Very well. I'll seek her statue at the Tabernacle.

**Weary Traveller:** Perhaps... perhaps that should have been your mission right from the start. *(hint of regret)*

**Weary Traveller:** The spark of promise burns in you once more, m'boy. And Mystra believes that spark may yet catch fire. *(Restrained hope - he's come to offer Gale the chance of redemption)*

**Weary Traveller:** She does not make such a gesture lightly. The hourglass measuring our time for such alternatives has but a few grains remaining. *(Grave, this reprieve is not without its dangers)*

**Weary Traveller:** Trust in yourself. Trust in the Weave. If you are willing, trust in Mystra. There is a conclusion yet to be written in this sorry tale, Gale of Waterdeep, and yours is the quill that will write it. *(Advising, offering hope)*

### Response: Not Surprised to See Me Alive

**Gale:** You don't seem all that surprised to see me alive and well.

**Weary Traveller:** I had been pondering what exactly I should say to you. This was not a conversation we were ever supposed to have, m'boy. *(Grave, almost mournful look)*

**Weary Traveller:** Selfish it may be, but I won't deny my happiness that you exercised patience in this matter. And, by now, you are surely aware of the evil we are up against. Karsus' pestilent Crown.

**Weary Traveller:** Perhaps now you understand what is at stake here, m'boy. Though what Mystra asked of you was extreme, it was not without merit nor demanded lightly.

### Response: Nothing in Particular (Evasive)

**Gale:** Oh, nothing in particular. Some charms here, some potions there...

**Weary Traveller:** Is that so? Well, far be it for this doddering old arch mage to pry into another man's shopping bag.

**Weary Traveller:** As we're here, I shall offer you a morsel of general and non-specific advice - yours to apply to any relevant knowledge you may have recently acquired.

**Weary Traveller:** Some things are best left broken. And some people are well worth restoring. *(Very pointed - telling Gale not to restore the crown, but to focus on improving himself)*

**Weary Traveller:** Mystra knows what I see in you. Just as I know what she sees in you. I was not born an old man. I know all too well what it's like to have a goddess fill your heart with longing.

**Weary Traveller:** She bids you come to her holy shrine in the Stormshore Tabernacle. There, she will grant you an audience at last. *(Urgent, serious - delivering the message he was bid to give to Gale)*

## Alternative Responses to the Tabernacle Invitation

### Response: She's Finally Getting Involved

**Gale:** She's finally decided to get involved, has she? About bloody time.

**Weary Traveller:** She was anything but idle - she chose you as her champion. A fine choice too, I thought. Yet now you threaten to prove otherwise...

**Weary Traveller:** I assure you, it will be very simple in the end - there is only success or failure.

**Weary Traveller:** If you will not hear it from me, hear it from your goddess. What truths she has to offer are for your ears alone, Gale of Waterdeep. Godspeed.

### Response: Sounds Dangerous

**Gale:** That sounds dangerous. I thought she wanted me dead?

**Weary Traveller:** Hardly. She wishes to wash away this bad blood between you, before it festers any further. Such grudges only lessen the chance any of us survive the strife to come. *(Grave. If Gale is against Mystra, this will be incredibly dangerous)*

**Weary Traveller:** She does not make such a gesture lightly. The hourglass measuring our time for such alternatives has but a few grains remaining. *(Grave, this reprieve is not without its dangers)*

### Response: Don't Need Mystra's Help

**Gale:** I don't need Mystra's help. I can defeat the Absolute without her.

**Weary Traveller:** That is true. Vanishingly unlikely, but true. You must forgive Mystra for despairing - she provided means and opportunity to end this, but that chance went unseized.

**Weary Traveller:** If there is another way, I trust you can find it. It is not in your nature or mine to stop looking, to accept the first answer to any dilemma. Do what you can - put that mind to work.

**Weary Traveller:** She does not make such a gesture lightly. The hourglass measuring our time for such alternatives has but a few grains remaining. *(Grave, this reprieve is not without its dangers)*

### Response: Too Late, I'm Getting the Crown

**Gale:** Whatever Mystra has to say to me, it's far too late. I'm getting that Crown.

**Weary Traveller:** There is only one reason why you should set your ambitions on such an item - to offer it over to Mystra as a token of your loyalty. Perhaps then she would overlook your earlier failings.

**Weary Traveller:** But if you crave it for yourself...? You would not just be failing her, you would be *challenging* her. Choose wisely, Gale. Do not trade one calamity for another.

**Weary Traveller:** If you will not hear it from me, hear it from your goddess. What truths she has to offer are for your ears alone, Gale of Waterdeep. Godspeed.

## Alternative Path: Gale Admits Crown Ambition

### Response: I'm Going to Reforge the Crown

**Gale:** I learned how to reforge the Crown of Karsus. And I'm going to do it.

**Weary Traveller:** *The Crown of Karsus?* You know what catastrophe that thing brought about for Netheril, don't you? *(Alarmed. Believes Gale is playing with fire)*

**Weary Traveller:** No one asks for an encore of Karsus' Folly - in fact, it might even be better to allow the Absolute to run rampant than to risk such a thing.

#### Sub-response: Destined for Greatness

**Gale:** I was destined for greatness, Elminster. This might be my only chance to take it.

**Weary Traveller:** Caution need not deny you the possibility of greatness, so long as you are willing to consider what your definition of greatness may be. It is too often applied where other, far less savoury terms would be appropriate. *(Advising, a hint of warning - don't get carried away with this)*

**Weary Traveller:** Mystra knows you defied her, Gale. Of course she knows - she's *Mystra*.

**Weary Traveller:** She bids you come to her holy shrine in the Stormshore Tabernacle. There, she will grant you an audience at last. *(Urgent, serious - delivering the message he was bid to give to Gale)*

#### Sub-response: Exploit the Crown's Powers

**Gale:** If I can exploit the Crown's powers, I could defeat the Absolute in an instant. We'd never fear their like again.

**Weary Traveller:** Exploit? To what end, m'boy...? It would be deeply unwise to repeat an old mistake, and anger Mystra yet further.

**Weary Traveller:** She knows you defied her, Gale. Of course she knows - she's *Mystra*.

**Weary Traveller:** She bids you come to her holy shrine in the Stormshore Tabernacle. There, she will grant you an audience at last. *(Urgent, serious - delivering the message he was bid to give to Gale)*

#### Sub-response: You Have a Better Suggestion?

**Gale:** You have a better suggestion? I'm all ears.

**Weary Traveller:** If there is some path yet undiscovered, some means of prising success from the maw of perdition... I believe I'm standing before the very wizard for the task.

**Weary Traveller:** Mystra knows you defied her, Gale. Of course she knows - she's *Mystra*.

## Additional Warnings About the Crown

*(If Gale explicitly said he plans to get the Crown of Karsus for himself)*

**Weary Traveller:** The Crown is not the answer. I promise you that.

**Weary Traveller:** If you will not hear it from me, hear it from your goddess. What truths she has to offer are for your ears alone, Gale of Waterdeep. Godspeed.
