---

## Raphael

### Raphael Defeated

**Gale:** No amount of contracts will save Raphael from the fate we forced upon him. A devil well-slain, if I say so myself.

---

### Orphic Hammer - Learned About

**Gale:** This Orphic Hammer sounds like quite the artefact. One I'll have no desire to consume, if that's your concern.

---

### Orphic Hammer - Obtained

**Gale:** The hammer we claimed is of incredible arcane craftsmanship. No wonder it was so fiercely protected. In the wrong hands, who knows what it might shatter...

---

### Sharrans Stole Orpheus Box

**Gale:** Another day, another god trying to make us her playthings. We'll have the whole pantheon interfering with us if we're not careful.

---

## The Emperor

### Emperor Revealed

**Gale:** Quite the rug pull, eh? A mind flayer manipulating us this whole time. Such creatures are not to be trusted, as a general rule, though this one does appear to have had a significant hand in our survival up to this point. At best, an ally whose motivations remain shrouded in deceit. We should be wary of what such an alliance may cost us.

---

### Astral Plane (Before Emperor Revealed)

**Gale:** Do not be lured in by the Astral Plane's beauty. It is a lethal expanse, one we should be careful in attempting to cross.

---

### Astral Plane (After Orpheus)

**Gale:** All this time, we were protected by a mind flayer... that *is* a turn up for the books.

---

### Astral Plane (Currently In)

**Gale:** The Astral Plane. Mortals such as we are not meant for this place. We must tread carefully.

---

### Returned From Astral Plane

**Gale:** I think we taught that inquisitor a very valuable lesson. He won't be ambushing anyone else in a hurry. Or doing anything else, for that matter.
