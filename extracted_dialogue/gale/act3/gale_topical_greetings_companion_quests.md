## Wyll

### Wyll - Eternal Pact to Save Father

**Gale (to Wyll):** Time and again, your plight reinforces my decision not to pursue the path of a warlock. Your father owes you his gratitude. I hope for your sake he is gracious enough to offer it, given what it cost.

**Gale (about Wyll):** Time and again, Wyll's plight reinforces my decision not to pursue the path of a warlock. Wyll's father owes him gratitude. I hope for his sake Ravengaard is gracious enough to offer it, given how much it cost.

### Wyll - Released From Pact

**Gale (to Wyll):** Time and again, your plight reinforces my decision not to pursue the path of a warlock. It's one thing to make such a sacrifice in the pursuit of such a pact, but to do so in order to escape one. Truly, it leaves you with nothing.

### Wyll - Blade of Frontiers

**Gale (to Wyll):** The people of Faerûn will be well served with you as their champion. 'The Blade of Frontiers. A fitting title for one so steeled with purpose.

### Wyll - Blade of Avernus

**Gale (to Wyll):** Do you feel that? The Hells themselves tremble to face such a scourge as you threaten to be. 'The Blade of Avernus.' Forged by a cambion, whetted on a dragon's hide. Those devils won't know what's coming for them.

### Wyll - Grand Duke

**Gale (to Wyll):** If there's heroism to be found in politics, I'm sure you'll find it. Somewhere...

## Shadowheart (Act 3 Content)

### Shadowheart - Shar Path, Saved Parents

**Gale (to Shadowheart):** Trust me when I say you're better off living unshaded by Shar's influence. Such a goddess would take everything from you, and still demand more.

**Gale (about Shadowheart):** I hope Shadowheart's parents are a welcome balm for her wounds. There will be pain in defying such a malicious goddess, but perhaps no more than in obeying her.

---

### Shadowheart - Shar Path, Killed Parents

**Gale:** Let's hope Shadowheart's actions do not return to haunt her. I know they would haunt me.

---

## Astarion

### Astarion - Spawn Ambush (Failed)

**Gale (to Astarion):** I hope you're still in one piece after that little reunion. Take it from me - your taste in company has much improved, if those spawn were anything to go by. Good riddance to them.

**Gale (general):** Not the kind of excitement I usually enjoy being woken up for. Still, better than not waking up at all. Or waking up as something else entirely.

---

### Astarion - Spawn Ambush (Succeeded)

**Gale:** Bested by simple vampire spawn, our companion snatched like a rattle from a babe. Astarion's fate depends on us. Given our resounding failure to protect him in the first place, I'm not sure I fancy his chances.

---

### Astarion - Kidnapped by Gur

**Gale:** The Gur are certainly efficient. Astarion's fate will not be an easy one. Nor painless.

---

### Astarion - Half Drained or Lied to Companion

**Gale:** You look remarkably perky. Nothing like a good night's sleep to restore the senses.

---

## Jaheira

### Jaheira - Kept Scroll

**Gale:** I'm certain it was merely prudence steering Jaheira's hand, and not any mistrust as to our heroic abilities. Fairly certain. Prudence was a contributing factor, at the very least.

---

### Jaheira - Burned Scroll

**Gale:** A hero of legend, passing the figurative torch on to us. We'd best not disappoint her - the thought of a scolding from Jaheira's ghost is *not* one I particularly relish.

---

### Jaheira - Visited Family

**Gale:** A natural impulse to try and shield one's loved ones from danger, especially when you feel a moral compunction to run head-first towards it. I suspect any child of Jaheira's will share her self-destructive sense of justice, but at least her words give them pause for thought.

---

## Minsc

### Minsc - Stone Lord Bounty

**Gale:** Sounds like we're not the only ones tracking down this 'Minsc' fellow. Let's hope Nine-Fingers' bounty doesn't attract too much competition.

---

### Minsc - Escaped Counting House

**Gale:** Of all the places I expected we'd find this Minsc, crawling from the broken jaws of a mimic wasn't high on my list. What's life without a few surprises, eh?

---

### Minsc - Recruited

**Gale:** Minsc seems quite the, er, *enthusiastic* ally. We'd all do well to remain on his good side. And out of range of his fists.

---

### Minsc - Not Saved (Jaheira Leaves)

**Gale:** Jaheira made her choice, however unwise it may be to divide our efforts at this juncture. A shame, but we'll forge ahead without her.

---

## Minthara

### Minthara - Recruited

**Gale:** Minthara's something of a closed book, but I suspect a heart of gold lurks beneath that stern countenance. Once she gets to know me, I'm sure she'll open up. She's just waiting for someone ready to listen.

---

## Lae'zel and Shadowheart

### Lae'zel and Shadowheart - Artifact Remains Secret

**Gale:** Don't worry, I've no interest in prizing that artefact from your grip. Your secrets are yours to keep.

---

### Lae'zel Kills Shadowheart (Not Act 1)

**Gale:** Lae'zel had the makings of a formidable ally, if one prone to acts of impulsive violence. Still, such conflicts will not serve our party well in resolving this little parasite problem of ours. Best we cast from the same spell book from now on.

---

## Guildhall Coup

**Gale:** Hardly the noblest conflict we've encountered, but criminals will have their squabbles, even in the looming shadow of utter annihilation.
