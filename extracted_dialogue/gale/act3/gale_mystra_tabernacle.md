## Opening Scene

**Narrator:** *There she stands, just as Elminster promised. Mystra. Goddess of the Weave. Mother of all magic.*

**Gale:** The old man wasn't lying. She's opened a summoning channel. Can't you feel it?

**Narrator:** *Gale's right. The very air around the statue crackles with magic, as though the Weave itself were coursing beneath her stony skin.* [For Sorcerers/Wizards]

**Narrator:** *Gale's right. The very air around the statue crackles with magic. It sets your teeth on edge.* [For non-casters]

**Gale:** A stream of pure, undiluted Weave. I only have to reach out, and it will carry me to Mystra, wherever she may be.

---

### Alternative Opening (If Elminster Not Met in Wyrm's Crossing)

**Narrator:** *There she stands. Mystra. Goddess of the Weave. Mother of all magic.*

**Gale:** Strange... Do you feel that? It's as though the Weave itself is rushing past us...

**Gale:** It's a summoning channel, the kind Mystra once used to call me to her side. I only have to reach for it, and it will take me to her side.

---

## Companion Interjections

A randomly selected companion may comment before Gale speaks further:

**Jaheira:** Well? Are you composing a poem in your head, or some such?

**Minthara:** Your goddess awaits. Hear her out, but remember that you do not owe her obedience, and you certainly do not owe her your life.

**Lae'zel:** Your goddess calls. Serve her or denounce her as you will - but you cannot ignore her.

**Wyll:** Go on, my good man. You can't exactly deny a goddess, now can you?

**Shadowheart:** [If enemy of Shar] An audience with your goddess can go wrong - I should know - but do whatever you feel is best, Gale.

**Shadowheart:** [If loyal to Shar] Mystra is a lesser goddess compared to Lady Shar, but if you have a chance to speak to her, you should seize it.

**Astarion:** Well? Go on, then - it's rude to keep a goddess waiting.

**Minsc:** Eh... the first step is difficult, of course. Minsc could throw you in, if you prefer?

**Halsin:** Do what you must, Gale. Mystra has weighed upon your heart and mind for too long.

**Karlach:** Go on then, Gale. We'll be here waiting for you when you're finished.

---

## Gale's Pre-Meeting Nervousness

**Gale:** Time was I'd have given my right arm for a chance to speak with Mystra again. The left one too. Maybe a knee...

### Player Encouragement Options

**Player:** You're ready for this, Gale.

**Gale:** Am I? You're right. I am a strong, capable wizard. And this is no more than a casual reunion with an ex-lover. My omnipotent, omniscient ex-lover...

---

**Player:** You don't owe her so much as a fingernail. She asked you to blow yourself up.

**Gale:** Not the message one hopes to receive from a past lover. But her first love was always the Weave. At best, I was a close second.

---

**Player:** I don't think she's that kind of goddess.

**Gale:** Thankfully not. Though she's not been averse to demanding the odd human sacrifice in recent days, has she?

---

**Gale:** When I pictured this moment, I thought I'd feel more in control. Yet here I am, with palms sweatier than a bugbear's armpit. I always wondered what being nervous would feel like. I hate it.

### Player Questions About His Feelings

**Player:** Do you know what you're going to say to her?

**Player:** Of all the things to be nervous about, an audience with a goddess seems reasonable.

**Gale:** You're kind to say so, but this is hardly my first time in Mystra's presence. It's more the matter of what I'm going to *say* to her.

**Player:** Why do you care what she thinks of you?

**Gale:** [To Clerics of Mystra] You know what it is to worship her, to respect her, to love her... It was intoxicating. An experience beyond expression.

**Gale:** [To non-Clerics] I don't suppose you can imagine what it's like, to have your god as your lover... It was intoxicating. An experience beyond expression.

**Gale:** [To Clerics of Mystra/Sorcerers/Wizards] No doubt you yourself have sought Mystra's wisdom from time to time, but to not only receive her blessings, but her love...

**Gale:** [Default] For a wizard, to have the love of the goddess of magic herself... It was intoxicating. An experience beyond expression.

---

**Player:** The Mother of all Magic would not summon you without reason. You must hear her out. [Cleric of Mystra]

**Player:** I'd give more than a few limbs to be summoned to Mystra's presence, to look on the Mother of Magic herself... [Wizard]

**Gale:** You have more faith in her than even I did... Understandable, though, when you have not loved her as deeply, or known the depths of her affections.

---

**Player:** Pull it together. You're going to make a fool of yourself otherwise.

**Gale:** Oh that hardly matters. There's not much further I could fall in Mystra's estimation. But I'd like to at least leave her with something to think about.

---

## Gale's Prepared Speech

**Gale:** During my time locked away in Waterdeep, I prepared a quite comprehensive speech for her on the subject of our former relationship, and the manner in which it ended. Alas, recent events have rendered the majority of it moot, so I'm going to have to improvise. Unless you have any words of wisdom to impart before I go?

---

## Pre-Meeting Advice - Branching Paths

### Path A: Cannot Come Along

**Player:** You're not taking me with you?

**Gale:** [To Sorcerers/Wizards] The summoning channel Mystra has provided is for me alone. No one else is permitted to enter it, no matter how talented a user of the Weave they are.

**Gale:** [Default] The summoning channel Mystra has provided is one only I can enter. No matter how much I'd prefer not to face her alone.

---

### Path B: Seek Forgiveness (Pushes Away from Crown)

**Player:** Seek her forgiveness, Gale. It might be your only hope of curing the orb.

**Gale:** [If previously swayed toward Crown] Mystra's forgiveness? If you want me to claim the Crown of Karsus, she'll hardly be in a forgiving mood after that. I think it's best I keep a cool head going into this. Approach it like a particularly high-risk round of Three-Dragon Ante. I'll let Mystra show her flight, and then I can see how strong a chance we stand of winning the gambit.

**Gale:** [If not swayed toward Crown] You're right. A heartfelt apology is the surest way to a goddess' heart, and her favour. I'd pray that she'll be in a forgiving mood, if she weren't the one I'd be praying to.

---

### Path C: Challenge Mystra (Pushes Toward Crown)

**Player:** Make her squirm. Tell her the Crown will be ours soon enough.

**Gale:** [If already swayed toward Crown] With pleasure. It's not often one has the chance to threaten a goddess and make good on it. Mystra won't be the one issuing the orders for much longer. She'll know exactly who's coming for her. This won't take long, and when I'm done, I'll be free of Mystra's yoke once and for all.

**Gale:** [If not swayed toward Crown] It's one thing for us to actually pursue the Crown. I'm not entirely sure I want to threaten Mystra with the prospect on her own turf, so to speak. I think it's best I keep a cool head going into this. Approach it like a particularly high-risk round of Three-Dragon Ante. I'll let Mystra show her flight, and then I can see how strong a chance we stand of winning the gambit.

---

### Path D: Stay Neutral

**Player:** Don't give anything away. Just find out what she has to say.

**Gale:** You'd make a fine Three-Dragon Ante player, you know. I think it's best I keep a cool head going into this. Approach it like a particularly high-risk round of Three-Dragon Ante. I'll let Mystra show her flight, and then I can see how strong a chance we stand of winning the gambit.

---

### Path E: Try to Prevent Meeting

**Player:** You shouldn't go to her, Gale. Don't give her the satisfaction.

**Gale:** What do you mean? I've been waiting for an opportunity like this since long before our paths crossed. This is my only opportunity to learn the truth. About the Crown, the orb, all of it. Why try to keep me from it?

**Player:** You're right. If you want to go, you should go.

*Gale proceeds to the meeting.*

---

**Player:** Even with the orb, you're one of the best wizards in the Realms. You don't need Mystra's help. [DC 30 Persuasion]

**Gale:** [Success] Fine. If you're so against the idea, I suppose we can forge ahead without input from the goddess of magic. I'm sure she has nothing pertinent to share whatsoever.

*The meeting is refused. Gale does not meet with Mystra.*

**Gale:** [Failure] Confident almost to the point of arrogance I may be, but in this matter I know she'll have wisdom to share. As for whether I choose to act upon it... we shall see.

*Gale proceeds to the meeting.*

---

## Gale's Departure

**Gale:** I'll only be gone for a matter of moments. The Outer Planes experience time quite differently to our own. Wait for me. Please.

---

# THE MEETING WITH MYSTRA

*Gale reaches a hand out in front of him, closes his eyes. A brilliant flash of white light and - he's in the Outer planes. Before him, Mystra in her celestial form.*

---

## Mystra's Greeting

**Mystra:** Gale of Waterdeep. You look well.

---

## Gale's Response - By Attitude

### SEEKING FORGIVENESS PATH

**Gale:** Mystra. I never thought we'd speak again like this. Why am I here?

**Mystra:** There is much unsaid between us, but time runs ever short. You discovered what lies at the Heart of the Absolute - the Crown of Karsus - and you disobeyed my instruction. *Why?*

**Gale:** I didn't want to die. And when I saw the Crown, I thought I might not have to, if I only understood its power.

**Mystra:** And you believe you have the right to such an understanding?

---

### CHALLENGING MYSTRA PATH - Option 1

**Gale:** No thanks to you. I wasn't expecting a summons, but then you did always prefer things on your terms.

**Mystra:** I did not come here to suffer a mortal's admonitions. Certainly not yours.

**Mystra:** You discovered what lies at the Heart of the Absolute - the Crown of Karsus - and you disobeyed my instruction. *Why?*

---

### CHALLENGING MYSTRA PATH - Option 2

**Gale:** You abandoned me in my hour of greatest need. I had no obligation to help you in yours.

**Mystra:** You still believe yourself to be so wronged? You always were stubborn.

---

### CHALLENGING MYSTRA PATH - Option 3

**Gale:** Because you had no right to ask that of me. You cast me out, remember?

**Mystra:** You were my lover, my Chosen, yet still you know so little of me.

---

### NEUTRAL PATH

**Gale:** As do you. But I assume we're not here solely to exchange compliments. So, why *am* I here?

**Mystra:** You discovered what lies at the Heart of the Absolute - the Crown of Karsus - and you disobeyed my instruction. *Why?*

---

## Mystra's Revelation - The Truth of the Orb

**Mystra:** The past cannot be undone with self-pity, nor can a future be forged. Only with the truth will you see the way ahead.

**Mystra:** The fragment of magic you tried to return to me was not of my creation. It was the Karsite Weave.

**Mystra:** It is a corrupted, half-born magic wrought in the brief moment Karsus ascended to godhood. It hungers for power just as he did, and it can *never* be sated.

**Mystra:** You unleashed something that would consume all magic in existence, and yet you thought only of preserving yourself.

---

### Gale's Reaction - Seeking Forgiveness

**Gale:** That can't be. It wasn't - it *couldn't* have been. I only wished to prove myself worthy. I had no idea...

**Mystra:** You were already worthy. What you lacked was patience, and it cost you dearly.

---

### Gale's Reaction - Challenging Mystra (Option 1)

**Gale:** Well somebody had to. You weren't exactly forthcoming with any offers of help.

**Mystra:** My concern was the preservation of *everything*. The Karsite Weave could tear apart the very fabric of the Material Plane.

---

### Gale's Reaction - Challenging Mystra (Option 2)

**Gale:** So that's what you're scared of. With the Crown of Karsus reforged, I could take control of the Karsite Weave.

**Mystra:** You can no more control the Karsite Weave than a weather vane could control a storm.

---

## The Cost of Gale's Actions

**Mystra:** When the Karsite Weave entered your body, your gifts were the first thing it consumed.

**Mystra:** That it entered your body and consumed no more than your powers was a miracle. But we will not be granted another.

**Mystra:** The only reason the 'orb' sleeps is because I have allowed it to feed on the true Weave - a temporary measure, but one that will not be enough to save us.

---

## The Threat of the Elder Brain

**Mystra:** With each day that passes, the elder brain threatens to become a new kind of god, its worshippers a scourge of soulless illithids.

---

## Mystra's Request

**Mystra:** If you will not use the orb to end this abomination, then you must find a way to separate Crown and host. When you've done this, you must surrender the Crown of Karsus to me.

---

## Gale's Decision - Multiple Outcomes

### AGREE TO SURRENDER THE CROWN (Redemption Path)

**Gale:** I won't let you down again. When the Absolute is vanquished, I will surrender Karsus' powers to you. You have my word.

**Mystra:** Thank you. May the Weave's light guide your purpose, and its wisdom guide your hand.

**Mystra:** The future of magic rests on your shoulders, Gale of Waterdeep. I promise you - it is a burden you are strong enough to bear.

*Mystra's form disappears. Gale stands in an ordinary temple before an ordinary statue once more. Mystra's idol gazes on, revealing nothing. Gale smiles to himself.*

---

### DEFY MYSTRA - CLAIM THE CROWN FOR HIMSELF

**Gale:** Not happening. When I get my hands on that Crown, I'm going to wield it. Karsus' powers will be mine.

**Mystra:** Crown yourself, Gale Dekarios, and you will learn what it is to carry such weight upon your shoulders. If it does not crush you, I will.

*Mystra's form disappears.*

---

### REMAIN UNCERTAIN - KEEP OPTIONS OPEN

**Gale:** A great ask indeed. You've given me much to think on - as you always did.

**Mystra:** So be it. Follow the needle of your own wisdom. We shall see how truly it leads you.

*Mystra's form disappears.*

## Notes

This scene is pivotal to Gale's character arc. The player's advice before he meets Mystra influences his attitude during the meeting, and his final decision determines:

1. Whether he's on the path to redemption (surrendering the Crown)
2. Whether he's pursuing power (claiming the Crown)
3. Whether he's still undecided

The scene also reveals crucial information about the nature of the orb - that it's not a fragment of the true Weave but rather the corrupted Karsite Weave created during Karsus's brief ascension. This recontextualizes Gale's entire condition and explains why Mystra couldn't simply "cure" him.

Mystra's statement that Gale "was already worthy" and only "lacked patience" is significant for his self-worth arc - he didn't need to prove himself through the desperate act that led to the orb. His mistake came from not trusting that he was already enough.
