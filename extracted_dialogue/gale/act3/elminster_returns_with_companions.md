# Elminster Returns - With Companions
**Location:** Balcony attached to Sharess' Caress, Wyrm's Crossing
**Trigger:** With Gale as a party member, after completing Sorcerous Sundries
**Context:** Elminster standing on a balcony, looking outward. He's here to relay Mystra's message to Gale - that Gale had a chance to sacrifice himself and destroy the Absolute previously, but hesitated. Now Elminster is here to relay the consequences and offer him another chance.

---

## Initial Greeting

**Gale:** Elminster? *(Not entirely surprised to see him)*

**Weary Traveller:** Hello m'boy. Don't mind me - I'm just enjoying a fresh lungful of Baldurian air - a distinctive aroma, though perhaps not one worthy of bottling. *(Rambling a bit)*

**Weary Traveller:** Tell me, what curiosities have you and your companions discovered within the walls of this esteemed emporium? *(He knows exactly what you were doing there - discovering the secret of the Crown of Karsus)*

### Variation: In Camp

**Weary Traveller:** I hear you've been browsing in most esteemed of emporiums, Sorcerous Sundries. Indulge my curiosity - what wonders did you discover there? *(He knows exactly what you were doing there - discovering the secret of the Crown of Karsus)*

---

## Discovery Path: The Annals of Karsus

**Weary Traveller:** So, you have learned the truth of the enemy we face - the very tool with which its eponymous creator unmade magic itself.

**Weary Traveller:** Perhaps now you understand what is at stake here, m'boy. Though what Mystra asked of you was extreme, it was not without merit nor demanded lightly.

---

## Elminster Not Surprised Path

**Weary Traveller:** I trusted he would be sensible enough to exercise caution in this matter, and to seek the truth. By now, you are aware of the evil we are up against.

**Weary Traveller:** Karsus' pestilent Crown. The very tool with which its eponymous creator unmade an empire, and magic itself.

**Weary Traveller:** Perhaps now you understand what is at stake here, m'boy. Though what Mystra asked of you was extreme, it was not without merit nor demanded lightly.

---

## Evasive Path: Nothing in Particular

**Weary Traveller:** Is that so? Well, far be it for this doddering old arch mage to pry into another man's shopping bag.

**Weary Traveller:** As we're here, I shall offer you a morsel of general and non-specific advice - yours to apply to any relevant knowledge you may have recently acquired.

**Weary Traveller:** Some things are best left broken. And some people are well worth restoring. *(Very pointed - telling Gale not to restore the crown, but to focus on improving himself)*

**Gale:** What are you saying? Or rather, what are you not saying?

**Weary Traveller:** Mystra knows you defied her, Gale. Of course she knows - she's *Mystra*.

**Weary Traveller:** She bids you come to her holy shrine in the Stormshore Tabernacle. There, she will grant you an audience at last. *(Urgent, serious - delivering the message he was bid to give to Gale)*

---

## Crown Ambition Revealed Path

**Gale:** Perhaps it would have been better to keep that particular opportunity between ourselves... *(Mildly chiding the player for oversharing their plans with Elminster)*

**Weary Traveller:** *The Crown of Karsus...?* No, Gale - it's for the best that I know. I trust there's no need to remind you what came of Karsus? His folly humbled a whole civilisation; no one seeks an encore of that. *(Alarmed. Believes Gale is playing with fire)*

### Response: Taking Risks

**Weary Traveller:** Caution need not deny you the possibility of greatness, so long as you are willing to consider what your definition of greatness may be. It is too often applied where other, far less savoury terms would be appropriate. *(Advising, a hint of warning - don't get carried away with this)*

**Gale:** What are you saying? Or rather, what are you not saying?

**Weary Traveller:** Mystra knows you defied her, Gale. Of course she knows - she's *Mystra*.

**Weary Traveller:** She bids you come to her holy shrine in the Stormshore Tabernacle. There, she will grant you an audience at last. *(Urgent, serious - delivering the message he was bid to give to Gale)*

### Response: Gale Can Succeed Where Karsus Failed

**Weary Traveller:** Does she speak true, Gale? You truly believe yourself capable of wielding Karsus' Crown? *(A little leery)* [FEMALE]

**Weary Traveller:** Does he speak true, Gale? You truly believe yourself capable of wielding Karsus' Crown? *(A little leery)* [MALE]

**Weary Traveller:** Do they speak true, Gale? You truly believe yourself capable of wielding Karsus' Crown? *(A little leery)*

**Gale:** Perhaps he does. Would you begrudge me the chance to make things right, Elminster? [MALE]

**Gale:** Perhaps she does. Would you begrudge me the chance to make things right, Elminster? [FEMALE]

**Gale:** Perhaps they do. Would you begrudge me the chance to make things right, Elminster?

**Weary Traveller:** Of course not. And the time has come for *precisely* that.

**Weary Traveller:** Mystra knows you defied her, Gale. Of course she knows - she's *Mystra*.

**Weary Traveller:** She bids you come to her holy shrine in the Stormshore Tabernacle. There, she will grant you an audience at last. *(Urgent, serious - delivering the message he was bid to give to Gale)*

## Responses to the Tabernacle Invitation

### Response: You Should Meet Her

**Gale:** I'm curious enough to make the attempt. All right - an audience with the mother of magic it is.

**Weary Traveller:** Perhaps... perhaps that should have been your mission right from the start. *(hint of regret)*

**Weary Traveller:** If there is another way, I trust you can find it. It is not in your nature or mine to stop looking, to accept the first answer to any dilemma. Do what you can - put that mind to work.

**Weary Traveller:** Trust in yourself. Trust in the Weave. If you are willing, trust in Mystra. There is a conclusion yet to be written in this sorry tale, Gale of Waterdeep, and yours is the quill that will write it. *(Advising, offering hope)*

### Response: Will Mystra Really Hear Him Out?

**Weary Traveller:** I see remaining optimistic as my duty - especially when I am not the one being asked to do the seemingly impossible.

**Weary Traveller:** If there is another way, I trust you can find it. It is not in your nature or mine to stop looking, to accept the first answer to any dilemma. Do what you can - put that mind to work.

### Response: Mystra's Done Enough Harm

**Weary Traveller:** Not true. Not even close. Mystra's ways may seem cold, high-handed, tyrannical even. But she is a goddess - her ways are not for mortal reckoning...

**Weary Traveller:** ...though some mortals come close to understanding. Very close indeed.

**Weary Traveller:** If there is another way, I trust you can find it. It is not in your nature or mine to stop looking, to accept the first answer to any dilemma. Do what you can - put that mind to work.

### Response: We'll Tell Her About the Crown

**Weary Traveller:** There is only one reason why you should set your ambitions on such an item - to offer it over to Mystra as a token of your loyalty. Perhaps then she would overlook your earlier failings.

**Weary Traveller:** But if you crave it for yourself...? You would not just be failing her, you would be *challenging* her. Choose wisely, Gale. Do not trade one calamity for another.

**Weary Traveller:** If you will not hear it from me, hear it from your goddess. What truths she has to offer are for your ears alone, Gale of Waterdeep. Godspeed.

### Response: Silent

**Gale:** Mystra's willing to speak to me again? Was this your doing, Elminster?

**Weary Traveller:** She knows what I see in you. Just as I know what she sees in you. I was not born an old man. I know all too well what it's like to have a goddess fill your heart with longing. *(Empathetic)*

**Weary Traveller:** Looking at you is like gazing into a mirror that shows centuries long past.

**Gale:** The past is the past, Elminster. And the future is... well, still to be decided. By me, not by Mystra. *(Confident)*

**Weary Traveller:** If there is another way, I trust you can find it. It is not in your nature or mine to stop looking, to accept the first answer to any dilemma. Do what you can - put that mind to work.

#### With Crown Warning

*(If Gale explicitly said he plans to get the Crown of Karsus for himself)*

**Weary Traveller:** The Crown is not the answer. I promise you that.

**Weary Traveller:** If you will not hear it from me, hear it from your goddess. What truths she has to offer are for your ears alone, Gale of Waterdeep. Godspeed.

#### Without Crown Warning

**Weary Traveller:** Trust in yourself. Trust in the Weave. If you are willing, trust in Mystra. There is a conclusion yet to be written in this sorry tale, Gale of Waterdeep, and yours is the quill that will write it. *(Advising, offering hope)*

## Alternative Paths: Crown as Control

### Response: Better We Control the Crown

**Weary Traveller:** This is not the way. However tempting it is to imagine such power would benefit this plane, it is a *curse*, and it always has been.

**Weary Traveller:** But perhaps the folly need not be repeated. Such a crown could be a fine token of your loyalty to Mystra, rather than a weapon to threaten her with.

**Gale:** And why exactly should Mystra have any say on what I do with Crown?

**Weary Traveller:** Mystra knows you defied her, Gale. Of course she knows - she's *Mystra*.

### Response: Better Suggestion?

**Weary Traveller:** If there is yet some path undiscovered, some means of prising success from the maw of perdition... I believe Gale here may yet sniff it out, if afforded the chance.

**Gale:** Mystra hasn't seemed inclined to hand out second chances so far. None she'd have me survive, anyway.

**Weary Traveller:** She has her reasons, m'boy. And it is time you understood them.

**Weary Traveller:** Mystra knows you defied her, Gale. Of course she knows - she's *Mystra*.
