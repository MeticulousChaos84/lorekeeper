# Gale - Topical Greetings: Baldur's Gate Locations (Act 3)

**Source:** Gale_InParty2_Nested_TopicalGreetings.html

---

## Wyrm's Crossing

**Gale:** Civilisation beckons at last. It's no Waterdeep, but Baldur's Gate is a respectable runner-up. Or at least a close third.

---

## Lower City

**Gale:** The bustle here takes some getting used to. A crackling fire and a tressym for company is usually more my speed. Still, we must flow with the current we find ourselves in, however tumultuous it may be. If you've need of me, I'm glad to help.

---

## Sewers

**Gale:** Nothing like the stench of human effluence to make you regret any and all prior life decisions.

---

## Bhaal Domain in Sewers

**Gale:** Is it me, or is the ground here particularly sticky? Almost as if... Some thoughts are best left unfinished. Now, please tell me there's some other subject you wish to occupy my mind with?

---

## Undercity

**Gale:** A shame it's so dank and decayed down here - I suspect there's a wealth of history to be uncovered, if any could hold their breath long enough to find it.

---

## Murder Tribunal (During)

**Gale:** What joy, to have found the nadir of common decency. Let's conclude our business here quickly, and never speak of it again.

---

## Murder Tribunal (Completed - Got Amulet)

**Gale:** Even being in the presence of that amulet makes my skin crawl. It's like feeling the eyes of Bhaal himself settling upon us.

---

## Wyrmway

**Gale:** Whatever ancient purpose is imbued in these halls, it may not welcome our presence here. We should be wary of whatever lurks beneath the dust.

---

## Steel Watch Foundry

**Gale:** What a thrill, to wander the corridors of the forge of tyranny itself. Better keep our thoughts to ourselves - who knows what might be listening to us here?

---

## Iron Throne - Arrived

**Gale:** Not entirely sure I'm a fan of being trapped at the bottom of the Chionthar. Better get ourselves out of here. Quickly.

---

## Iron Throne - Returned

**Gale:** The sooner we're back on solid ground, the better.

---

## House of Hope

**Gale:** I never thought this journey of ours would see us knocking on a devil's door. Can't say I'm relishing the experience, but needs must.

---

## Cazador's Palace

**Gale:** The living may not be prevented from crossing a vampire's threshold, but that doesn't make us any more welcome. Tread carefully.

---

## Shar Grotto

**Gale:** I've not felt the presence of the Shadow Weave like this since we left behind that cursed darkness. We must be on our guard.
