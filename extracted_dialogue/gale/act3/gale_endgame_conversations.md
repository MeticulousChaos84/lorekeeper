# Gale - Endgame Conversations (Act 3)

**Context:** These conversations occur during the final confrontation with the Netherbrain across multiple locations: Morphic Pool arrival, Astral Plane (after Netherbrain confrontation), during the tadpole choice discussion, and High Hall interior.

## Astral Plane - Initial Reactions

### After Confronting the Netherbrain

**Gale:** It seems the brain's more reluctant to let go of the crown than we anticipated. Separating the crown from that monstrosity will be harder than we imagined. It might be time to reconsider our strategy.

---

**Gale:** We've a city to save. I think it's about time we got started.

---

### After Freeing Orpheus

**Gale:** I confess, in my head I saw that going a lot less amicably. I hope our newly-freed ally proves more reliable than the last.

---

### After Betraying the Emperor

**Gale:** I'm not sure I ever considered the Emperor an ally, exactly, but even so, it's strange to know we're on our own at last.

---

### Relief at Your Survival (Romanced)

**Gale:** You're okay - thank the heavens and hells and everything in between. I thought the brain would take you from me.

---

## Advice on the Tadpole Choice

**Gale:** Quite the choice you're faced with: surrender the Netherstones to a mind flayer, or surrender your soul and become one. If you need advice, I'll do my best - though I have to say I've not much to draw on in this case. It's rather a unique predicament to have landed yourself with.

### If Asked for Advice

**Gale:** As it stands, I see no option free of sacrifice in one form or another. So the question becomes - what are you willing to give up? Relinquish the stones, and you place your fate in the hands of a creature whose trustworthiness is hardly guaranteed. Keep the stones, and you relinquish the very essence of your being. Your soul, your emotions, your purpose. You would lose everything, and might live with such a loss for eternity. All I can say is - whatever choice you make, if it leads us to taking the Crown it will be worth it. And I will ensure you are well taken care of.

---

**Gale:** Barely awake a moment, and the prince of the githyanki demands you surrender your soul?

---

**Gale:** If the path we tread were easy, there'd be a queue of fools willing to walk it. Alas, it isn't. And such grim choices must fall to us.

---

## The Orb - Willing to Sacrifice Path

### When Convinced to Consider Using the Orb

**Gale:** The elder brain was already a formidable foe, but the Netherbrain is on the cusp of achieving a godhood of its own. Sacrificing myself to destroy it wasn't exactly the form of immortality I hoped for, but perhaps the time for hope has passed altogether. Now we need certainty. So be it - I will be ready, whatever you decide.

---

### Offering the Orb as an Alternative

**Gale:** I trust you to know the course we must take. But my offer stands - if none wish to shoulder the illithid's burden, the orb would achieve the same ends.

**Alternative:** There is, of course one more course to consider. The orb. None need shoulder the illithid's burden, if that is what you decide.

---

**Gale:** Fate seems determined to make a mindflayer of you, as it would make a cataclysm of me. Make your choice - the orb will be there regardless.

---

**Gale:** Please - I need a moment.

---

## High Hall - Before the Final Battle

### When Asked About Using the Orb

**Gale:** I'd need a ream of parchment longer than an elder brain's stem to capture the tumult I feel at that particular prospect. But I'm ready, if that's the word you need to hear. If you call on me, I will not let you down.

---

### Reflections on the Crown

**Gale:** 'When?' I'm glad you have such confidence in our endeavour. I confess, my own's not constructed from such immutable materials.

**If Gale Promised to Surrender Crown to Mystra:** I made a promise to my goddess. One I will do my best to keep. For the sake of this city, I can only hope that my best will be enough.

**If Gale Challenged Mystra:** I challenged my goddess, defied her will, and promised her destruction. Fail to get the crown after all that, and if the embarrassment doesn't finish me off, Mystra might.

**Alternative:** I don't dare to imagine making such a decision when there's the small matter of the enormous brain beneath the crown still to overcome. Ask me again when the illithid scourge has been wiped from this city, and I'll have an answer for you. Until then - it's best not to count on anything.

---

### On Their Chances Against the Netherbrain

**Gale:** I'm cautiously optimistic. Though with the time left to us, and the amount still to be done, it's best we don't take anything for granted. Who knows what shape these final moments of ours might assume? Not I. Not Mystra. Not even you. But whatever my fate might be, I'll be glad to greet it in such fine company.

---

## Romance - Final Moments

### Romanced - Morphic Pool/Astral Plane

**Gale:** The scent of Netheril hangs heavy in this place. The brain is close, as is the crown. I'm glad we face such a monster together.

---

**Gale:** The aura of Netheril hangs heavy in this place. The brain is close, as is the crown. As is victory, dare we begin to hope...

**If Emperor Still Allied:** I hope that wasn't our only chance. We *must* get hold of that crown.

**Gale:** I don't think it was. Though I confess, the prospect of trying to outwit a brain the size of Mount Waterdeep is a challenge even for me.

---

### Pre-Battle Kiss

**Gale:** I hope that wasn't our last kiss. I'd take a thousand more if I could.

---

### Romanced - High Hall

**Gale:** Strolling these streets together would have been quite magical, in other circumstances. This is all a tad apocalyptic for my liking.

---

## Reactions to Circumstances

### If Player Becomes a Mind Flayer

**Gale:** I'd be lying if I said it wouldn't take some getting used to, but what can a few extra tentacles do to a bond as strong as ours? When this is all over, we'll have time enough to unpick the specifics of your new condition. Psionics alone could take months to thoroughly evaluate, not to mention the matter of your diet - But I'm getting ahead of myself. We've a Netherbrain to defeat. *Then* we get to the fun stuff.

---

### On the High Hall's Destruction

**Gale:** The High Hall was once a beacon of promise, of wisdom, of celebration. Now... well, it's just a beacon, and for all manner of horrors. A pity.
