# Gale Bomb Option - Endgame Sacrifice Offer

**Source File:** `END_IllithidOptions_WRD_GaleBombOption.html`

**Context:** After the Emperor or Orpheus discusses the player's options to either transform into a mind flayer or hand over the Netherstones, Gale reminds the player that he is willing to use the orb as an alternative solution. This dialogue triggers in the Astral Prism during the Illithid Options scene.

**Requirements:** Gale must be willing (but not eager) to die (ORI_Gale_State_WillingToDie set).

## If Emperor Presented Options (Orpheus Still Imprisoned)

**Gale:** An easy proposition for the Emperor to make - 'become a mind flayer' - *it* has no soul to sacrifice. If it did - perhaps it would understand the weight of what it's asking of us. And why we might seek an alternative.

I know, we've been through this before. But our situation has changed since then, and not for the better. I think it's time we reconsider the orb.

*[solemn and sincere]*

With its power, I could put an end to this whole thing - Crown, Netherbrain, Absolute. Everything.

### Player Responses

**If player asks about sacrifice:**

**Gale:** If I'm destined to die, I can think of worse ways. At least if I use the orb, I can ensure the brain dies with me.

*[with a sad knowing smile]*

**If player questions trusting orb over Emperor:**

**Gale:** In a word - yes. The real question is, do you trust me?

Do not mistake me - I want to live. But I've been careless enough with my life in the past. I can hardly stand by and watch you sacrifice yours.

*[persuading you of a grim but necessary course of action]*

Once I'm in position, I will ensure you are removed to a safe vantage point to watch the fireworks. You need not die alongside me. Nor surrender your soul in becoming an illithid.

## If Orpheus Was Freed First

**Gale:** Barely woken from his slumber, and already the prince of the githyanki demands one of us surrender our souls in service of him.

*[hint of an eye roll - not surprised]*

No doubt, in the context of aeons of torture, it seems a small ask. But, of course, he does not realise what else we might have to offer.

*[transitions to same offer as above]*

## Gale's Offer and Reassurances

**Gale:** You're really serious about this?

**Gale:** Entirely.

*[sincere, with conviction]*

Please - at least consider my offer.

*[sincere]*

### If Player Refuses

**Player:** I could never ask you to make such a sacrifice, Gale.

**Gale:** Regardless, my offer stands. Should you change your mind, I will not let you down.

*[sincere]*

### If Player Accepts

**Player:** Very well. If the time comes - I'll call on you to use the orb.

**Gale:** I will not let you down.

*[sincere]*

### If Player Firmly Rejects

**Player:** No, Gale - we're not considering it. End of discussion.

**Gale:** Very well. We'll do this the old fashioned way then - swords, spells and sweat. Adventurers to the end - whatever form it may take.

*[determination in the face of truly formidable odds]*

## If Karlach Offered to Transform

**Player:** It's okay, Gale. Karlach *wants* to transform. She'll do it, for herself and for us.

**Gale:** Then I will hold my peace. But if the time comes when even her sacrifice is not enough, call on me, and I will be ready.

## Additional Context Options

**If player has Orphic Hammer but hasn't freed Orpheus:**

**Player:** What about Orpheus? If we free him, he might offer another way.

**Gale:** He is the prince of a people who've spent aeons nursing a hatred of the very creature nestled in our skulls. Save him, and who's to say he wouldn't run us through at the first opportunity?

**If considering freeing Orpheus:**

**Player:** We should free Orpheus. Then we'll decide.

**Gale:** If you think it's best, but I hope you're confident in your powers of persuasion. The last thing we need is another enemy to contend with.

**If Gale visited Mystra's shrine:**

**Player:** Mystra will cure you if we bring her the Crown of Karsus. You don't need to do this.

**Gale:** To cure me of the orb, yes. But what of the guilt of allowing one of my friends to sacrifice their very soul and become illithid? Or worse, trusting a mind flayer to wield the stones, and giving it the chance to dominate a Netherbrain?

*[persuading you of a grim but necessary course of action]*

---

## If Orpheus is Free and Requires Sacrifice

**Player:** I understand not trusting the Emperor, but Orpheus loathes illithids. If he insists we transform, it *must* be the only way.

**Gale:** Just because we do not like the alternative, does not mean we are not free to choose our course.

---

## Standing Offer Summary

Regardless of outcome:

**Gale:** Make the best decision you can - that's all anyone could ask of you. I will stand by your side regardless.

## Notes

This dialogue represents one of the most significant moments in Gale's arc - his genuine willingness to sacrifice himself to save his friends, not out of desperation or self-destruction, but from a place of agency and love. The contrast with Mystra's original command for him to detonate is important: he refused her command to die for her glory, but will choose to die for the people he cares about.

The dialogue also shows his distrust of both the Emperor and Orpheus, maintaining that mortal agency and self-sacrifice may be preferable to trusting unknowable entities with ultimate power.
