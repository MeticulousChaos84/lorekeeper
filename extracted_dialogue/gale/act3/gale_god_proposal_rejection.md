## Opening (If Gale Hasn't Spoken to Mystra About the Orb)

**Gale:** I owe you an apology. Things became quite heated between us before, after I learned of the Crown of Karsus. I allowed myself to get carried away, and failed to properly explain myself.

*[Player can accept apology, ask for explanation, or dismiss him]*

**Gale:** Thank you. But I owe you more than that. I need to help you understand just what this could mean for us.

*[Or if questioned:]*

**Gale:** When are we not doing something dangerous? Give me a chance - I think I can help you understand.

*[Or if dismissed:]*

**Gale:** I can't. Your opinion matters greatly to me. Give me a chance - I think I can help you understand.

### Early Rejection: "I believe in you, but not in this."

**Gale:** Words alone are not enough. Permit me to show you. Please, close your eyes a moment.

*[Player can close eyes, ask "Just what am I agreeing to?", or refuse entirely]*

#### **Rejection Path:** "No, Gale. Whatever you have to show me - I don't need it."

**Gale:** No matter. Far be it for me to impose the majesty of the celestial canvas on those unwilling to partake of its beauty. *[A bit miffed but trying to take it on the chin]* Enjoy the rest of your evening. *[Disappointed]*

*[End - Gale walks away]*

## Opening (If Gale Spoke to Mystra and Learned About Karsite Weave)

**Gale:** Ah. You're still talking to me then?

**Gale:** I wouldn't blame you for giving me a wide berth. I thought the orb's ever-present censure had tamed my wilder ambition, but that wasn't the case.

**Gale:** I needed Mystra's intervention. She offered me a path to redemption at last, and it might yet leave my mind and body intact.

**Gale:** Please - continue to believe in me. I want to show you the wizard I am capable of being, rather than the poor excuse for a man who's kept you company thus far.

*[Player expresses belief in him]*

**Gale:** That's all I ever need to hear.

**Gale:** I know what I must do. The Crown belongs under Mystra's stewardship, not mine, and I will ensure she gets it.

**Gale:** That means there'll be no permanent place in the heavens for us. But we could still visit.

## The Star Boat Vision (For Both Paths)

**Gale:** Please, close your eyes a moment.

*[Player closes eyes]*

**Gale:** *Astra navigabimus.* *[Latin spellcasting - "we sail the stars"]*

*[The player closes their eyes and the screen briefly fades to black. Gale speaks over black, casting a spell.]*

**Gale:** Few mortals ever glimpse what you're about to see. But don't be alarmed - I'm here with you. Now... open your eyes.

*[Fade up from black as the player opens their eyes to a dazzling spectacle. They and Gale are now sitting in a small boat that shimmers with iridescent light. Unpiloted, it silently meanders through a majestic, infinite starfield.]*

**Gale:** Quite the view, isn't it? The Outer Planes are a place of profound, sometimes overwhelming possibility.

**Gale:** I conjured this illusion often during my confinement in Waterdeep. An escape for the mind, where there was none for the body.

**Gale:** It was easier to stare at the celestial abyss than recognise the emptiness within myself. Easier to pretend my destiny lay among such stars, than work to salvage a life on solid ground. You changed all that.

## Rejection Paths Within the Vision

### Path A: "I don't need the stars, Gale. I have you."

**Gale:** Then have me - but have the best possible version of me. *[Gale is sitting in the boat]*

**Gale:** The tadpoles, the orb - these threats to our existence - the gods could aid us if they wished, but instead they cower behind Ao. So let us act ourselves. *[Ao = AY-oh (an overlord deity that most gods answer to)]*

**Gale:** With the power of the crown, any foe would be rendered impotent, incapable of interfering with us. I used to believe Mystra's forgiveness was worth dying for. But I was wrong. You showed me just how much I have to live for.

**Gale:** With you, I forget my goddess. I love you.

**Gale:** Tell me you feel the same way. Tell me you want what I want. We can seize the crown and create a new world, better than this one.

#### **Rejection Response A1:** "I love you. But for the man that you are. Not the god you'd pretend to be."

**Gale:** But think what I offer. The vastness of eternity to explore, the Weave at our fingertips... You would really prefer me as I am? *[Genuine, vulnerable - the player just told him they loved him in a way that no one else has]*

*[Player can respond with variations of "Yes, I want you as you are" or stop his protests with a kiss]*

##### **If player stops his protests with a kiss:**

*[The player and Gale lean in to kiss while seated facing each other.]*

*[The boat drifts away amidst the stars.]*

*[End]*

##### **If player reaffirms "You're already everything I need you to be":**

**Gale:** I hope you're right. I truly do. Godly power, perhaps I can live without, but you? You're everything. *[Expression brightening up.]*

*[Player can kiss him or say nothing and answer with a kiss]*

*[The player and Gale lean in to kiss while seated facing each other.]*

*[The boat drifts away amidst the stars.]*

*[End]*

---

### Path B: "This is wrong, Gale. That power will corrupt you, even if you can seize it."

*[Note: Tagged variants include SORCERER/WIZARD: "Mystra herself was once mortal. The power would corrupt you, as you believe it corrupted her." and CLERIC variations about gods being corrupted by power]*

**Gale:** It won't, I swear to you. It's merely a tool - a means to an end.

**Gale:** You told me once to choose you, the one who loved me. That's exactly what I'm trying to do. To be the man you deserve.

**Gale:** But if I'm going to keep you safe, to keep our relationship the way it should be - the way I want it to be - I need to be more than I currently am.

**Gale:** What more is there to be said?

#### **Rejection Response B1:** "Plenty, in time. This doesn't have to be the end for us - just forget the crown."

**Gale:** But I could be so much more to you. *[Crestfallen]*

##### **If player responds: "You're already everything I need you to be."**

**Gale:** I hope you're right. I truly do. Godly power, perhaps I can live without, but you? You're everything. *[Expression brightening up.]*

*[Player can kiss him or say nothing and answer with a kiss]*

*[The player and Gale lean in to kiss while seated facing each other.]*

*[The boat drifts away amidst the stars.]*

*[End]*

##### **If player responds: "Enough. If you won't see sense, just take me back."**

**Gale:** As you wish. Take a moment to soak the view. I doubt you will be privy to it again. *[Resigned]*

*[The remaining stars blink out like snuffed candles, leaving only the faint glow of the boat. Gale and the player sit silently for a moment. The scene fades fully to black.]*

*[End]*

---

### Path C: Challenging His Defiance of Mystra

*[When player questions: "You'd defy Mystra? As if we need more enemies."]*

**Gale:** I've already defied Mystra. Had I followed her command, there'd be nothing left of me but a smoking crater.

**Gale:** The tadpoles, the orb - these threats to our existence - the gods could aid us if they wished, but instead they cower behind Ao. So let us act ourselves.

**Gale:** With the power of the crown, any foe would be rendered impotent, incapable of interfering with us. I used to believe Mystra's forgiveness was worth dying for. But I was wrong. You showed me just how much I have to live for.

**Gale:** With you, I forget my goddess. I love you.

**Gale:** Tell me you feel the same way. Tell me you want what I want. We can seize the crown and create a new world, better than this one.

*[Leads to same rejection branches as Path A above]*

---

### Path D: Questioning His Ambition

*[When player asks: "Are you saying you want to ascend? Claim godhood?"]*

**Gale:** No, not like that. I don't want to join them, I want to *better* them. A god's powers, paired with a mortal conscience, a mortal heart.

**Gale:** The tadpoles, the orb - these threats to our existence - the gods could aid us if they wished, but instead they cower behind Ao. So let us act ourselves.

*[Continues same as Path C above]*

---

### Path E: Warnings of Folly

*[When player says: "I don't doubt your motivations, but do this, and you will match Karsus' folly with your own."]*

**Gale:** What more is there to be said?

*[Leads to same rejection branches as Path B above]*

---

### Path F: Direct Concern

*[When player says: "This sounds dangerous."]*

**Gale:** What more is there to be said?

*[Leads to same rejection branches as Path B above]*

---

## Alternative Rejection: Complete Dismissal

*[If player says: "Nothing. Take me back." or "This folly is your own - I want nothing to do with it."]*

**Gale:** As you wish. Take a moment to soak the view. I doubt you will be privy to it again. *[Resigned]*

*[The remaining stars blink out like snuffed candles, leaving only the faint glow of the boat. Gale and the player sit silently for a moment. The scene fades fully to black.]*

*[End]*

## Narrative Significance

These rejection paths set the flag `ORI_Gale_State_RejectedBeMyGodProposal` and push Gale away from using the Crown (`ORI_Gale_Event_PushAwayFromCrown`). The player's rejection of his divine ambitions, combined with affirmation of love for him as he is, becomes crucial to his eventual redemption arc - choosing to return the Crown to Mystra and embrace mortality.

The most emotionally resonant rejections are those that combine refusal of godhood with affirmation of love - particularly "I love you. But for the man that you are. Not the god you'd pretend to be." This directly addresses his core wound: the belief that he must be exceptional, must be *more*, to be worthy of love.

When the player tells him "You're already everything I need you to be," it challenges his fundamental assumption that worthiness comes from power rather than from simply being himself.
