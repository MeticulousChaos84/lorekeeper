# Party Banter: Wyll Gale Tadpole

*Wyll points out that he used to kill big monsters, and now a few goblins are a challenge. What gives? Gale remarks it must be the tadpole.*

**Wyll:** Was a time I tussled with hill giants without breaking a sweat.

**Wyll:** Now, a mere werebear could swat me halfway to Amn.

**Gale:** Strange things are happening to us. What festers in our minds may well impel our bodies.
