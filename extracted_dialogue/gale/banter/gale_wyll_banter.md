# Gale & Wyll Banter

*Collected party banter between Gale and Wyll*

---

## Act 1

### The Tadpole's Effects

*Wyll points out that he used to kill big monsters, and now a few goblins are a challenge. What gives? Gale remarks it must be the tadpole.*

**Wyll:** Was a time I tussled with hill giants without breaking a sweat.

**Wyll:** Now, a mere werebear could swat me halfway to Amn.

**Gale:** Strange things are happening to us. What festers in our minds may well impel our bodies.

---

### Two Time Bombs

*Wyll points out that Gale has two ticking time-bombs inside him - but he's holding together pretty well.*

**Wyll:** I admire your courage, Gale.

**Gale:** Thank you. Any particular reason?

**Wyll:** Between the orb and the bug, you've got more than your fair share of unwelcome passengers.

**Gale:** What can I say? Mother always taught me to be a gracious host.

---

### Heroic Titles

*Wyll tells Gale he's got potential, and suggests he rename himself something more... heroic. Gale finds Wyll quite the tryhard.*

**Wyll:** You're an impressive fighter, Gale. You should consider a new name.

**Gale:** I take it you have some suggestions?

**Wyll:** 'The Wizard Wonder!' Or how about, 'The Master of the Weave'?

**Gale:** Tempting. But I think we might already have the maximum number of theatrical titles.

---

### Netherese Magic (with Astarion)

*Wyll recalls the hag said 'Netherese' and asks Gale what he knows. Astarion adds a thought if he is present.*

**Wyll:** Ethel mentioned Netherese magic. What in blazes does that mean?

**Gale:** Magic from the fallen empire of Netheril. Ancient, exceedingly dangerous, and quite unrivalled.

**Astarion:** Wonderful! I'd hate to be destroyed by any common old magic.

---

### Romance (Act 1)

**Gale:** *Have you noticed any attachments of the more, erm, romantic variety flourishing in our camp, Wyll?*

**Wyll:** I think I'm not the right person to be asking.

**Wyll:** I can recognise a troll's silhouette on a far horizon, but I wouldn't know a flirtation if you whacked me alongside the head with it.

---

## Act 2

### Shadow-Cursed Forest

**Wyll:** What a dismal forest. Monsters could be lurking behind any and every tree.

**Gale:** We'd be wise to fear the trees themselves. It feels like the forest itself longs for our destruction.

**Wyll:** Frustrating, that.

**Wyll:** Monsters, I can fight. But I can no more sever these shadows than I could the wind or the sun.

---

### Reithwin Village

**Wyll:** *I've known goblin raiders to slaughter entire villages and strip them for loot - but I've never seen one ravaged like this.*

**Gale:** *It's hard to imagine anyone who'd willingly inflict such devastation, be they zealots, marauders, invading armies... A sign of far worse to come, I fear.*

---

### House of Healing

**Wyll:** This was a hospital? Feels more like a prison.

**Gale:** A common enough interpretation. Sickness has a nasty habit of making you feel trapped, if only within the confines of your own body.

**Gale:** I once spent weeks convalescing in the Hospice of St Laupsenn after a nasty bout of ruddy pox. For all their kindness, leaving that place behind felt like freedom to me.

**Wyll:** I've always relied on the kindness of the healers and menders of the Coast. Better a cleric's healing touch than a chirurgeon's scalpel.

---

### Moonrise General

**Wyll:** This is no aimless horde - the Absolute's forces are organised. What do you make of it, Gale?

**Gale:** All enemies have some chink in their armour, no matter how much they like to believe themselves invulnerable. That's what we must find.

**Wyll:** And if we don't find any clear weakness?

**Gale:** Then we hope our mutual strengths are enough to dominate them. Or, we die nobly in the attempt.

---

### Moonrise General (Assault State)

**Wyll:** This is it, Gale - today, we annihilate the heart of the Absolute's power. The bards will sing of our victory here.

**Gale:** *Entirely unnecessary. Though if they are so inclined, I might be convinced to share a stanza or two of my own for inspiration.*

---

### Moonrise Prison

**Gale:** Not a devil in sight. How disappointing.

**Wyll:** I doubt a few iron bars are sufficient to hold one of Zariel's.

**Gale:** True enough. But an illithid pod? That would probably do the trick.

**Wyll:** I wager you're right. Ah, Gale - what a pleasure to see a genius' mind at work.

**Wyll:** *Of course Mizora was Zariel's captured asset. How did I not see it coming?*

**Gale:** It's in a devil's nature to conceal the truth - you can't fault yourself for that.

**Wyll:** I've been pacted for seven years on, Gale. I should be able to read between Mizora's lines by now, no matter how narrow the gap.

**Gale:** How long have you been pacted to Mizora, Wyll?

**Wyll:** Seven years. Seven years of hunting the monsters of the Sword Coast - and seven years of Mizora's tight leash.

**Wyll:** And seven years of wondering if I'd ever rid myself of her - or if I even should.

---

### Romance (Act 2)

**Gale:** *I've heard that in Baldur's Gate, 'wizard' is also a term used for one who eschews their more, ahem, carnal desires. Is that true, Wyll?*

**Wyll:** Where are we going with this, Gale?

**Gale:** Oh, nowhere. I just think it a rather cruel misnomer. Not at all reflective of the glamour wizarding life affords.

---

## Act 3

### Guild Hall

**Wyll:** It might seem a bit ramshackle, but this place has a boastworthy bar.

**Gale:** A bar is only as good as its cellars. Which vintages can we expect to find on their racks?

**Wyll:** Here, a bottle is judged more by its ability to crack heads than the quality of its contents.

**Gale:** Ah. If that's the main criteria then I shall reset my expectations accordingly. Water it is.

---

### Romance (Act 3)

**Wyll:** I used to believe the beauty of first love was unable to be surpassed.

**Wyll:** But Gale - you are so much more tolerable now you've found your second.

**Gale:** I'll take that comment with the sincerity and good will I assume it was intended.
