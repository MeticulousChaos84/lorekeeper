# Party Banter: Shadowheart Gale Blushingmermaid

*Banter between SH and Gale in a tavern in Baldur's Gate.*

---

**Shadowheart:** Not too downmarket of an establishment for you I hope, Gale?

**Gale:** Not at all. Why, some of the finest artists and musicians began their careers amidst stale beer and sticky floors.

**Gale:** There is poetry to be found in even the dingiest of holes.

**Shadowheart:** Remind me to not attend any poetry recitals with you.
