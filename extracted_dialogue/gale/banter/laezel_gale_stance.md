# Party Banter: Laezel Gale Stance

*Gale remarks on Laezel's battle stance. Lae'zel says it is a gith move and offers to teach him. He declines.*

---

**Gale:** Your prowess in battle is remarkable, as is your battle stance itself.

**Lae'zel:** *Hrath ajak - a technique known to few outside K'liir. Shall I teach you?*

**Gale:** I'll pass, thank you. I prefer Abjuration over acrobatics.
