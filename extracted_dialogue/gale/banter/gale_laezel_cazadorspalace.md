# Party Banter: Gale Laezel Cazadorspalace

*Gale/Laezel banter in Cazador's Palace.*

---

**Gale:** I always wondered what a vampire's lair would look like. Can't say I pictured it being quite this... theatrical.

**Lae'zel:** I find it surprisingly similar to Queen Vlaakith's aesthetic.

**Gale:** That makes sense. She does have a flair for the dramatic.
