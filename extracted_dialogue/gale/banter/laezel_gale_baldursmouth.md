# Party Banter: Laezel Gale Baldursmouth

*Party Banter for Laezel and Gale in Elfsong about Baldur's Mouth*

---

**Lae'zel:** Drink, dance, and song. Tu'narath's residents are known to partake in all three. Substantially.

**Gale:** Is that so? I assumed there to be little time for frivolity amongst all the fighting.

**Lae'zel:** Eternity is long, Gale. Long enough to pursue endeavours beyond combat.

**Lae'zel:** *Githyanki write symphonies, craft liquors, paint frescos. When they aren't in fierce battle with ghaik, of course.*
