# Party Banter: Shadowheart Gale Refugees

*(This banter can trigger after the player has entered the grove). Shadowheart and Gale converse while travelling. The topic turns to the refugees who are pouring through the general area in search of safety.*

---

**Gale:** The road to Baldur's Gate is a long one. Who knows how long it'll take these folks to get there on foot?

**Shadowheart:** *If they make it. They're slow, vulnerable. Half or more will die long before Basilisk Gate.*

**Gale:** Doesn't seem to trouble you a jot.

**Shadowheart:** What good would it do for me to be troubled? We can't save them all.
