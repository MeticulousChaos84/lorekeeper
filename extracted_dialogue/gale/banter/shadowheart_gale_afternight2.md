# Party Banter: Shadowheart Gale Afternight2

*(Triggers following Ceremorphosis2) Shadowheart and Gale converse while travelling. The topic turns to the previous night in camp, when they discussed their tadpole problem.*

---

**Shadowheart:** Still no symptoms?

**Gale:** No signs of tentacles so far.

**Shadowheart:** The same... except for a knot of worry in my stomach that's in no rush to go away.

**Gale:** That I can relate to.
