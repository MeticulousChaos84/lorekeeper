# Party Banter: Gale Minthara Rivington

*Minthara teases Gale about his flying cat Tara, who is hunting in the city*

---

**Gale:** Pigeons, gulls, sparrows - these streets make a fine hunting ground for a tressym like Tara.

**Nightwarden Minthara:** In the Underdark, we have packs of winged hounds to deal with vermin like your precious Tara.

**Gale:** Flying hounds? Come now - you're pulling my leg, aren't you?

**Nightwarden Minthara:** Yes I am. It is the bats that would make a meal of her.
