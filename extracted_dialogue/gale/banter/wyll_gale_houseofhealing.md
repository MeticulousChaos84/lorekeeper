# Party Banter: Wyll Gale Houseofhealing

---

**Wyll:** This was a hospital? Feels more like a prison.

**Gale:** A common enough interpretation. Sickness has a nasty habit of making you feel trapped, if only within the confines of your own body.

**Gale:** I once spent weeks convalescing in the Hospice of St Laupsenn after a nasty bout of ruddy pox. For all their kindness, leaving that place behind felt like freedom to me.

**Wyll:** I've always relied on the kindness of the healers and menders of the Coast. Better a cleric's healing touch than a chirurgeon's scalpel.
