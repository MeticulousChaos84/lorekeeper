# Party Banter: Wyll Gale Scl Forest

---

**Wyll:** What a dismal forest. Monsters could be lurking behind any and every tree.

**Gale:** We'd be wise to fear the trees themselves. It feels like the forest itself longs for our destruction.

**Wyll:** Frustrating, that.

**Wyll:** Monsters, I can fight. But I can no more sever these shadows than I could the wind or the sun.
