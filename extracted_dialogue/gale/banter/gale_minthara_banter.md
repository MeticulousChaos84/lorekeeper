### Romance (Act 2) - Gale on Minthara

**Gale:** I'm glad to know you have a softer side, Minthara. I was beginning to think you rather heartless.

**Nightwarden Minthara:** Loving another is not soft, wizard. It is one of the hardest things a person can do.

**Gale:** So you admit you've found love! How delightful - I'm happy for you both.

**Nightwarden Minthara:** You've been smiling like a fool of late, wizard. Explain yourself.

**Gale:** I've found love. Surely even you wouldn't begrudge me some happiness.

**Nightwarden Minthara:** All I will say on the matter is that you were wise to lower your standards from the godly to the ghastly.

**Gale:** Pigeons, gulls, sparrows - these streets make a fine hunting ground for a tressym like Tara.

**Nightwarden Minthara:** In the Underdark, we have packs of winged hounds to deal with vermin like your precious Tara.

**Gale:** Flying hounds? Come now - you're pulling my leg, aren't you?

**Nightwarden Minthara:** Yes I am. It is the bats that would make a meal of her.

**Nightwarden Minthara:** Indeed. I have been dosing my partner while they sleep by my side.

**Nightwarden Minthara:** They refuse to take it in their food, but I must build up their immunity in case we ever visit Menzoberranzan together.

**Gale:** Let's never speak of this again.

**Nightwarden Minthara:** In Menzoberranzan, after a house has two sons, every subsequent male-born child is slaughtered at birth, as it is useless, even for breeding.
