# Party Banter: Minsc Gale Waterqueen

*Minsc remembers how he tried to blow the Waterdeep conch*

---

**Minsc:** Umberlee - her clerics possess a nasty streak as wide as her oceans.

**Gale:** So their reputation suggests - especially among the good folk of Waterdeep. I'm curious to learn how you fell foul of them...

**Minsc:** *'Blasphemy', said the temple priestess. But Minsc says: do not give horns to your statues if you do not wish the visitors to try and make them toot.*

**Gale:** Yes, that would probably do it.
