# Gale & Shadowheart Banter

*Collected party banter between Gale and Shadowheart*

---

## Act 1

### After Night 2

*(Triggers following Ceremorphosis2) Shadowheart and Gale converse while travelling. The topic turns to the previous night in camp, when they discussed their tadpole problem.*

**Shadowheart:** Still no symptoms?

**Gale:** No signs of tentacles so far.

**Shadowheart:** The same... except for a knot of worry in my stomach that's in no rush to go away.

**Gale:** That I can relate to.

### Knowledge of Ceremorphosis

*Shadowheart and Gale converse as they travel. Shadowheart enquires about Gale's apparent knowledge of ceremorphosis.*

**Shadowheart:** You seem to know a good deal about our condition, Gale.

**Gale:** Everything, really - not to put too fine a point on it.

**Shadowheart:** A humble specimen, aren't you?

**Gale:** On occasion.

### The Refugees

*(This banter can trigger after the player has entered the grove). Shadowheart and Gale converse while travelling. The topic turns to the refugees who are pouring through the general area in search of safety.*

**Gale:** The road to Baldur's Gate is a long one. Who knows how long it'll take these folks to get there on foot?

**Shadowheart:** *If they make it. They're slow, vulnerable. Half or more will die long before Basilisk Gate.*

**Gale:** Doesn't seem to trouble you a jot.

**Shadowheart:** What good would it do for me to be troubled? We can't save them all.

### Romance (Act 1)

*Banter between SH and Gale in Act 1.*

**Shadowheart:** Isn't it so, that every time you speak as you cast a spell, you're endeavouring to call upon Mystra?

**Shadowheart:** I'm surprised she still listens to you.

**Gale:** *She has no choice - she's sworn to hear all magic users. Even me.*

**Gale:** I'm sure she at least stuffs her fingers in her ears to muffle my invocations.

## Act 2

### Last Light Shrine

*Banter between SH and Gale*

**Shadowheart:** *Imagine being compelled to hide a shrine in a land that is actively hostile to you and your goddess. Utter pigheadedness.*

**Gale:** Tenacity might be a kinder word for it.

**Shadowheart:** I'll leave the kinder words to the softer hearts.

**Shadowheart:** A Selunite shrine. It would've made my blood boil, once, just to look upon this...

**Gale:** You are lucky to have left that anger behind.

**Shadowheart:** I don't know... the anger was simple. I understood it, found comfort in it. Now I don't know what to believe.

### Romance (Act 2)

*Banter between Shadowheart and Gale in Act 2*

**Gale:** When you've loved a goddess - as I have - people often think you less experienced in the ways of romance.

**Gale:** *It's true, for a time I neglected the physical in favour of celestial euphoria. But our relationship was no less real for it.*

**Shadowheart:** 'She just lives on another plane.'

**Shadowheart:** Only jesting. I'm in no position to judge - especially after what happened with Shar.

**Shadowheart:** Only jesting. I know all too well what it's like to pine after a goddess...

**Shadowheart:** Only jesting. I'm sure you're a force to be reckoned with.

## Act 3

### Blushing Mermaid

*Banter between SH and Gale in a tavern in Baldur's Gate.*

**Shadowheart:** Not too downmarket of an establishment for you I hope, Gale?

**Gale:** Not at all. Why, some of the finest artists and musicians began their careers amidst stale beer and sticky floors.

**Gale:** There is poetry to be found in even the dingiest of holes.

**Shadowheart:** Remind me to not attend any poetry recitals with you.

### Morphic Pool

**Shadowheart:** The end must be near. No regrets, Gale? You may have been better off staying inside that boulder...

**Gale:** Unlikely. Had I stayed there much longer, the orb would have reduced it to rubble. Besides, think of all the fun I'd have missed out on.

**Shadowheart:** Fun? Well... yes. I suppose we did manage to make the best of things.
