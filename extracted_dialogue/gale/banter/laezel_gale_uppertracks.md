# Party Banter: Laezel Gale Uppertracks

*Party Banter for Laezel and Gale in Harborview Park/Upper Tracks*

---

**Lae'zel:** These flowers are quite vivid - not to mention, pungent. Not to my liking.

**Gale:** Are there no flowers in Tu'narath?

**Lae'zel:** *In the City of Death, the mlar cultivate the fruiting bodies that sprout from the corpses of the slain.*

**Gale:** I'd rather get them from my florist in Waterdeep, if it's all the same to you.
