# Party Banter: Gale Karlach Sorceroussundries

*Gale/Karlach banter at the Sorcerous Sundries.*

---

**Gale:** Look around you. Indulge your curiosity. Sorcerous Sundries is the finest purveyor of magical miscellany for miles around.

**Karlach:** Where's the axes?

**Gale:** What they sell is far more precious than mere sword or shield. They sell knowledge, ingenuity, the wisdom of mages past.

**Karlach:** Sounds like more your thing than mine.
