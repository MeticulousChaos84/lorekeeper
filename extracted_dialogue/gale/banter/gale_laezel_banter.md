# Gale & Lae'zel Banter

*Collected party banter between Gale and Lae'zel*

---

## Act 1

### Battle Stance

*Gale remarks on Lae'zel's battle stance. Lae'zel says it is a gith move and offers to teach him. He declines.*

**Gale:** Your prowess in battle is remarkable, as is your battle stance itself.

**Lae'zel:** *Hrath ajak - a technique known to few outside K'liir. Shall I teach you?*

**Gale:** I'll pass, thank you. I prefer Abjuration over acrobatics.

---

### Dialect

*Lae'zel mocks Gale for always talking like an old tome. He responds with a quite loquacious insult.*

**Lae'zel:** You've a particular way with words, Gale. Perhaps oration suits you more than battle.

**Gale:** They're not mutually exclusive. The Weave is served best with a dash of eloquence.

---

### The Astral Plane

*Lae'zel asks Gale what his interest is in the astral plane, and he equivocates.*

**Lae'zel:** Tell me, Gale: what is your interest in the Astral Plane?

**Gale:** Time. Or rather: the absence of it. In the Astral Plane, everything is eternal.

**Lae'zel:** It will be my home soon enough, should Vlaakith will it.

---

### Purification (Part 1)

*Gale asks Lae'zel about purification. What does that mean, exactly? Lae'zel mentions the Zaith'isk (device that removes it.)*

**Gale:** Tell me, Lae'zel, when you say we might be 'purified' at your crèche, what does that mean exactly?

**Lae'zel:** *A ghustil will affix the zaith'isk, the purifier, to our heads.*

**Lae'zel:** Its magic will quell the parasite in an instant.

---

### Purification (Part 2)

*Gale follows up on previous purification discussion. What is this device, exactly? Lae'zel says she can say no more, by covenant.*

**Gale:** *That zaith'isk you mentioned intrigues me. Care to tell me a bit more?*

**Lae'zel:** *An intricate device, crafted by mlar - our most gifted artisans. I am sworn to say no more.*

---

### Vlaakith (with Shadowheart)

*Gale asks Lae'zel about the lich queen Vlaakith. Lae'zel says she is as fearsome as he heard. If Shadowheart is there, she thinks Vlaakith sounds more gross than fearsome.*

**Gale:** I was wondering about your queen, Vlaakith. What tales of her reach us are terrifying, but I suppose that's not how you would describe her.

**Lae'zel:** Vlaakith is unity: fear and beauty, life and unlife. Eyes like onyx, teeth like daggers. There is none more perfect.

**Shadowheart:** Sounds vile. I assume the meaning of 'perfect' was lost in translation...

---

### Waterdeep (with Wyll)

*Lae'zel notes that Gale knows a lot about mind flayers. He responds with information about his training. If there, Wyll chimes in as well.*

**Lae'zel:** *You strike me cleverer than most istiki, Gale. Multiple tutors, I should guess.*

**Gale:** Many a wise man and woman indeed. Waterdeep is the home of myriad scholars.

**Wyll:** Ah, the City of Splendours. Spent a whole Fleetswake there with my father. What a delight.

---

### Romance (Act 1)

**Gale:** Indulge me, Lae'zel. As someone unfettered by Faerûnian beauty standards, how would you appraise my appearance?

**Lae'zel:** Your beard looks like the hairy tufts upon the psurlon, the largest of wormkind that slither our skies.

**Gale:** *I suppose that's a bad thing? No - don't answer that.*

---

## Act 2

### Moonrise Oubliette

*Party Banter for Lae'zel and Gale in Moonrise Oubliette*

**Lae'zel:** The right of these prisoners to die in mortal combat was stolen from them.

**Gale:** Hardly the worst atrocity the Absolute's committed.

**Lae'zel:** One of many, but by no means the least. To die properly is a matter of honour.

---

### Tadpoling Center

*Party Banter for Lae'zel and Gale in the Illithid Colony (Tadpoling Center)*

**Lae'zel:** A tadpole nursery, as on the nautiloid. We must not leave it intact.

**Gale:** Quite right. So long as the attempt won't leave us similarly dismantled...

**Lae'zel:** Caution is commendable. Boldness is extraordinary. In this case, I recommend the latter.

---

### Romance (Act 2)

**Gale:** *So, Lae'zel - have you ever been tempted to use psionics in your, erm, romantic endeavours?*

**Lae'zel:** Only once. Did you know, In low-gravity settings, githyanki can maintain aerial suspension for hours at a time?

**Gale:** *Fascinating - I think the archmage Tasha described a spell with similar effect. I really must look that up...*

---

## Act 3

### Cazador's Palace

*Gale/Lae'zel banter in Cazador's Palace.*

**Gale:** I always wondered what a vampire's lair would look like. Can't say I pictured it being quite this... theatrical.

**Lae'zel:** I find it surprisingly similar to Queen Vlaakith's aesthetic.

**Gale:** That makes sense. She does have a flair for the dramatic.

---

### Abandoned House

*Party Banter for Lae'zel and Gale in Abandoned House*

**Lae'zel:** What is this...? This place makes me feel sad. Melancholy.

**Gale:** Ah, so you're susceptible to the tragedy of a broken home. Maybe you've more in common with us weaker beings than you thought...

**Lae'zel:** There's no call to be insulting.

---

### Baldur's Mouth

*Party Banter for Lae'zel and Gale in Elfsong about Baldur's Mouth*

**Lae'zel:** Drink, dance, and song. Tu'narath's residents are known to partake in all three. Substantially.

**Gale:** Is that so? I assumed there to be little time for frivolity amongst all the fighting.

**Lae'zel:** Eternity is long, Gale. Long enough to pursue endeavours beyond combat.

**Lae'zel:** *Githyanki write symphonies, craft liquors, paint frescos. When they aren't in fierce battle with ghaik, of course.*

---

### Bloomridge Park

*Party Banter for Lae'zel and Gale in Bloomridge Park*

**Lae'zel:** These children and their pets lack discipline. Were they githyanki, I'd recommend further training.

**Gale:** Not everyone approaches the raising of their young with such militaristic vigour.

**Lae'zel:** That is the very purpose of training - to determine which children shall be warriors, and which are suited to other roles.

**Lae'zel:** As for the unruly animals - they would make for nutritious marching rations.

**Gale:** That's certainly one way to make them behave...

---

### Felogyr's Fireworks

*Party Banter for Lae'zel and Gale in Felogyr's Fireworks*

**Lae'zel:** Fireworks - a particularly gnomish field of art, no?

**Gale:** Indeed. More than simple craft, it's a way of life for some of them.

**Lae'zel:** That may explain why most gnomes possess such short fuses.

**Gale:** *Lae'zel! Was that a joke?*

**Lae'zel:** Only if you found it funny.

---

### Rivington

*Party Banter for Lae'zel and Gale in Rivington*

**Lae'zel:** Cowards at every turn in this community. In githyanki society, they would be retrained - or culled.

**Gale:** Condoning the slaughter of the weak? Not the most charitable perspective to take.

**Lae'zel:** I am observing, not condoning. A meaningful difference.

---

### Upper Tracks

*Party Banter for Lae'zel and Gale in Harborview Park/Upper Tracks*

**Lae'zel:** These flowers are quite vivid - not to mention, pungent. Not to my liking.

**Gale:** Are there no flowers in Tu'narath?

**Lae'zel:** *In the City of Death, the mlar cultivate the fruiting bodies that sprout from the corpses of the slain.*

**Gale:** I'd rather get them from my florist in Waterdeep, if it's all the same to you.

---

### Water Queen's House

*Party Banter for Lae'zel and Gale in Waterqueen's House*

**Lae'zel:** *Githyanki gish sail skiffs through the Astral Sea, an ocean far larger than Umberlee's.*

**Gale:** Does the Astral Sea come with an equally irritable goddess?

**Lae'zel:** Vlaakith holds dominion over the entire plane. And she is not 'irritable' - she is ruthless.

**Lae'zel:** Vlaakith holds dominion over the entire plane. And 'irritable' does not even begin to describe her.

---

### Romance (Act 3)

**Lae'zel:** Gale, I've heard you talking in your sleep. Your mate needs better rest for our journey.

**Gale:** And deprive them of the pleasure of hearing my nocturnal postulations? I'd never be so cruel.

**Gale:** The mind absorbs much while we believe ourselves dormant. To lie beside Gale of Waterdeep is positively educational.
