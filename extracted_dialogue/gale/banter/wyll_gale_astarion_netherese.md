# Party Banter: Wyll Gale Astarion Netherese

*Wyll recalls the hag said 'Netherese' and asks Gale what he knows. Astarion adds a thought if he is present.*

---

**Wyll:** Ethel mentioned Netherese magic. What in blazes does that mean?

**Gale:** Magic from the fallen empire of Netheril. Ancient, exceedingly dangerous, and quite unrivalled.

**Astarion:** Wonderful! I'd hate to be destroyed by any common old magic.
