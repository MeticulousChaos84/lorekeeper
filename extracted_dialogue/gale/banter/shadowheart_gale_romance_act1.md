# Party Banter: Shadowheart Gale Rom Act1

*Banter between SH and Gale in Act 1.*

---

**Shadowheart:** Isn't it so, that every time you speak as you cast a spell, you're endeavouring to call upon Mystra?

**Shadowheart:** I'm surprised she still listens to you.

**Gale:** *She has no choice - she's sworn to hear all magic users. Even me.*

**Gale:** I'm sure she at least stuffs her fingers in her ears to muffle my invocations.
