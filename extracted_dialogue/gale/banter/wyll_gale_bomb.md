# Party Banter: Wyll Gale Bomb

*Wyll points out that Gale has two ticking time-bombs inside him - but he's holding together pretty well.*

---

**Wyll:** I admire your courage, Gale.

**Gale:** Thank you. Any particular reason?

**Wyll:** Between the orb and the bug, you've got more than your fair share of unwelcome passengers.

**Gale:** What can I say? Mother always taught me to be a gracious host.
