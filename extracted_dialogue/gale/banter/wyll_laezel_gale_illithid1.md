# Party Banter: Wyll Laezel Gale Illithid1

*Wyll asks Lae'zel about mind flayers. Do they have a leader? A god? Lae'zel comments about elder brains. Gale adds a thought if he is present.*

---

**Wyll:** Who's in charge of the mind flayers, Lae'zel? Is there a squid king or something?

**Lae'zel:** *No. Each ghaik is servant to an elder brain. No king unites elders - only their collective tyranny.*

**Gale:** A mind flayer monarch, imagine that. Such a thing could shatter worlds.
