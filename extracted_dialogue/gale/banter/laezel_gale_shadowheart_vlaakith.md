# Party Banter: Laezel Gale Shadowheart Vlaakith

*Gale asks Lae'zel about the lich queen Vlaakith. Lae'zel says she is as fearsome as he heard. If Shadowheart is there, she thinks Vlaakith sounds more gross than fearsome.*

---

**Gale:** I was wondering about your queen, Vlaakith. What tales of her reach us are terrifying, but I suppose that's not how you would describe her.

**Lae'zel:** Vlaakith is unity: fear and beauty, life and unlife. Eyes like onyx, teeth like daggers. There is none more perfect.

**Shadowheart:** Sounds vile. I assume the meaning of 'perfect' was lost in translation...
