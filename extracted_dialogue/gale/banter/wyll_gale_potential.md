# Party Banter: Wyll Gale Potential

*Wyll tells Gale he's got potential, and suggests he rename himself something more... heroic. Gale finds Wyll quite the tryhard.*

---

**Wyll:** You're an impressive fighter, Gale. You should consider a new name.

**Gale:** I take it you have some suggestions?

**Wyll:** 'The Wizard Wonder!' Or how about, 'The Master of the Weave'?

**Gale:** Tempting. But I think we might already have the maximum number of theatrical titles.
