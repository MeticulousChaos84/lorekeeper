# Party Banter: Karlach Gale Rom Act1

*Gale had first stage of romance/attraction with player - not yet anything official*

---

**Gale:** Karlach... a hypothetical question for you:

**Gale:** If someone - not me, of course - detected a hint of romantic interest in them from another, unnamed individual, what might that someone do about it?

**Karlach:** Whoever it is, just talk to them, Gale. And leave out the hypotheticals.

**Gale:** Talking. Right. I'm good at that.
