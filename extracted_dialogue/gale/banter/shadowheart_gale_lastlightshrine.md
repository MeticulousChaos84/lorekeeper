# Party Banter: Shadowheart Gale Lastlightshrine

*Banter between SH and Gale*

---

**Shadowheart:** *Imagine being compelled to hide a shrine in a land that is actively hostile to you and your goddess. Utter pigheadedness.*

**Gale:** Tenacity might be a kinder word for it.

**Shadowheart:** I'll leave the kinder words to the softer hearts.

**Shadowheart:** A Selûnite shrine. It would've made my blood boil, once, just to look upon this...

**Gale:** You are lucky to have left that anger behind.

**Shadowheart:** I don't know... the anger was simple. I understood it, found comfort in it. Now I don't know what to believe.
