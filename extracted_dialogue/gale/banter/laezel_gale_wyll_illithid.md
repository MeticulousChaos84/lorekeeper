# Party Banter: Laezel Gale Wyll Illithid

*Lae'zel notes that Gale knows a lot about mind flayers. He responds with information about his training. If there, Wyll chimes in as well.*

---

**Lae'zel:** *You strike me cleverer than most istiki, Gale. Multiple tutors, I should guess.*

**Gale:** Many a wise man and woman indeed. Waterdeep is the home of myriad scholars.

**Wyll:** Ah, the City of Splendours. Spent a whole Fleetswake there with my father. What a delight.
