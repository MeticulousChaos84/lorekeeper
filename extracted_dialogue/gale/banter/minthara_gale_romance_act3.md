# Party Banter: Minthara Gale Rom Act3

---

**Nightwarden Minthara:** Do you have elder siblings, wizard?

**Gale:** You're about to say something awful, aren't you?

**Nightwarden Minthara:** In Menzoberranzan, after a house has two sons, every subsequent male-born child is slaughtered at birth, as it is useless, even for breeding.

**Nightwarden Minthara:** You have the aura of a third child about you.
