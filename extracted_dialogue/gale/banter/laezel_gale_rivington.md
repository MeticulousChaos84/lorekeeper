# Party Banter: Laezel Gale Rivington

*Party Banter for Laezel and Gale in Rivington*

---

**Lae'zel:** Cowards at every turn in this community. In githyanki society, they would be retrained - or culled.

**Gale:** Condoning the slaughter of the weak? Not the most charitable perspective to take.

**Lae'zel:** I am observing, not condoning. A meaningful difference.
