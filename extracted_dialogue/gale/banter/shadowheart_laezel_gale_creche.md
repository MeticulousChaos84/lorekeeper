# Party Banter: Shadowheart Laezel Gale Creche

*Shadowheart, Lae'zel and Gale converse while travelling. Shadowheart asks what happens if Lae'zel hopes of being cured at a gith creche don't work out. Lae'zel doesn't even want to consider such an option. Gale chimes in, saying that Baldur's Gate will be their best chance - many skilled people are drawn there.*

---

**Shadowheart:** What if this crèche doesn't work out, Lae'zel? What if your kin fail you?

**Lae'zel:** If I can reach the crèche, my kin will provide - any failure will be mine alone.

**Shadowheart:** If you say so. Just don't expect me to put all my eggs in the same basket.

**Gale:** That expression must sound curious to a githyanki ear, given the way they're birthed.
