# Party Banter: Karlach Gale Blightedvillage

---

**Karlach:** Looks like this town was ransacked - by soldiers, if my eyes don't deceive me.

**Gale:** Quite cruelly, too.

**Karlach:** Must've been an awful day for the people who lived here.

**Gale:** If nothing else, I hope it was a mercifully short one.
