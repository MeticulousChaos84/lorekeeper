# Party Banter: Wyll Gale Rom Act1

**Gale:** *Have you noticed any attachments of the more, erm, romantic variety flourishing in our camp, Wyll?*

**Wyll:** I think I'm not the right person to be asking.

**Wyll:** I can recognise a troll's silhouette on a far horizon, but I wouldn't know a flirtation if you whacked me alongside the head with it.
