# Party Banter: Gale Astarion Rom Act2

---

**Gale:** I fear I've been rather hasty to judge you, Astarion.

**Gale:** One heartbreak was quite enough for me, but to experience it as many times as you have must change a person.

**Astarion:** Thank you, Gale. Let us both hope that broken hearts are a thing of the past.
