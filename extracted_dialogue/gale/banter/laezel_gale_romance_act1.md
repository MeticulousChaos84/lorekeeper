# Party Banter: Laezel Gale Rom Act1

**Gale:** Indulge me, Lae'zel. As someone unfettered by Faerûnian beauty standards, how would you appraise my appearance?

**Lae'zel:** Your beard looks like the hairy tufts upon the psurlon, the largest of wormkind that slither our skies.

**Gale:** *I suppose that's a bad thing? No - don't answer that.*
