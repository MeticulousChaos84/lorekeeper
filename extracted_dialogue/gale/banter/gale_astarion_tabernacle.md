# Party Banter: Gale Astarion Tabernacle

*Gale/Astarion banter at the Basilisk Gate.*

---

**Gale:** Mystra has a shrine within the city. Located in the Stormshore Tabernacle, if my memory serves me.

**Astarion:** Do whatever you need to, but I shan't be paying my respects to any of the gods on show.

**Gale:** You never felt the call of the divine, Astarion?

**Astarion:** Oh, I tried them all. None of them answered.
