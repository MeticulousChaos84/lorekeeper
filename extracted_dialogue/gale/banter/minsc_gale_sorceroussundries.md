# Party Banter: Minsc Gale Sorceroussundries

*Gale offers protection to Minsc in the Sorcerous Sundries shop*

---

**Minsc:** Minsc has never trusted places such as this. Too much of a wizard's power can be simply packaged and picked up.

**Minsc:** *Well, picked up by all but Minsc. When he touches the many delicate little jars, oh how the wizards shout and stare!*

**Gale:** *Fear not, Minsc. You have a wizard at your side who positively encourages such curiosity. You'll fit right in.*

**Minsc:** Obliged, wizard. Should we find our way to a weaponsmith, Minsc will rough you up a little - so that you too can fit in.
