# Party Banter: Laezel Gale Tadpolingcenter

*Party Banter for Laezel and Gale in the Illithid Colony (Tadpoling Center)*

---

**Lae'zel:** A tadpole nursery, as on the nautiloid. We must not leave it intact.

**Gale:** Quite right. So long as the attempt won't leave us similarly dismantled...

**Lae'zel:** Caution is commendable. Boldness is extraordinary. In this case, I recommend the latter.
