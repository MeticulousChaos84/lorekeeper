# Party Banter: Laezel Gale Purification1

*Gale asks Lae'zel about purification. What does that mean, exactly? Lae'zel mentions the Zaith'isk (device that removes it.)*

---

**Gale:** Tell me, Lae'zel, when you say we might be 'purified' at your crèche, what does that mean exactly?

**Lae'zel:** *A ghustil will affix the zaith'isk, the purifier, to our heads.*

**Lae'zel:** Its magic will quell the parasite in an instant.
