# Party Banter: Laezel Gale Felogyrsfireworks

*Party Banter for Laezel and Gale in Felogyr's Fireworks*

---

**Lae'zel:** Fireworks - a particularly gnomish field of art, no?

**Gale:** Indeed. More than simple craft, it's a way of life for some of them.

**Lae'zel:** That may explain why most gnomes possess such short fuses.

**Gale:** *Lae'zel! Was that a joke?*

**Lae'zel:** Only if you found it funny.
