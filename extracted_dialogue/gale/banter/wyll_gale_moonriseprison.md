# Party Banter: Wyll Gale Moonriseprison

---

**Gale:** Not a devil in sight. How disappointing.

**Wyll:** I doubt a few iron bars are sufficient to hold one of Zariel's.

**Gale:** True enough. But an illithid pod? That would probably do the trick.

**Wyll:** I wager you're right. Ah, Gale - what a pleasure to see a genius' mind at work.

**Wyll:** *Of course Mizora was Zariel's captured asset. How did I not see it coming?*

**Gale:** It's in a devil's nature to conceal the truth - you can't fault yourself for that.

**Wyll:** I've been pacted for seven years on, Gale. I should be able to read between Mizora's lines by now, no matter how narrow the gap.

**Gale:** How long have you been pacted to Mizora, Wyll?

**Wyll:** Seven years. Seven years of hunting the monsters of the Sword Coast - and seven years of Mizora's tight leash.

**Wyll:** And seven years of wondering if I'd ever rid myself of her - or if I even should.
