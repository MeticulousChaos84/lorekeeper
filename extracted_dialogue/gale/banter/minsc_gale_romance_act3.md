# Party Banter: Minsc Gale Rom Act3

---

**Minsc:** Gale. Minsc worries you might send a fireball up his butt, with all of this stringy hair in your face.

**Gale:** Is that why you keep your head shaved? I assumed it was a custom of some sort.

**Minsc:** Oh, no! Most warriors of Rashemen wear long battle-braids, weighed down with stone. Minsc can show you, when next we camp?

**Gale:** Thank you, but I'm more wizard than warrior. I'm not sure my scalp would stand up to such a plaiting.
