# Party Banter: Wyll Gale Rom Act2

---

**Gale:** *I've heard that in Baldur's Gate, 'wizard' is also a term used for one who eschews their more, ahem, carnal desires. Is that true, Wyll?*

**Wyll:** Where are we going with this, Gale?

**Gale:** Oh, nowhere. I just think it a rather cruel misnomer. Not at all reflective of the glamour wizarding life affords.
