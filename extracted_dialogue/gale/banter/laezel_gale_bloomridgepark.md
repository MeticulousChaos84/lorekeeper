# Party Banter: Laezel Gale Bloomridgepark

*Party Banter for Laezel and Gale in Bloomridge Park*

---

**Lae'zel:** These children and their pets lack discipline. Were they githyanki, I'd recommend further training.

**Gale:** Not everyone approaches the raising of their young with such militaristic vigour.

**Lae'zel:** That is the very purpose of training - to determine which children shall be warriors, and which are suited to other roles.<br>

**Lae'zel:** As for the unruly animals - they would make for nutritious marching rations.

**Gale:** That's certainly one way to make them behave...
