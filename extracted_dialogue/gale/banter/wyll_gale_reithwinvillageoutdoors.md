# Party Banter: Wyll Gale Reithwinvillageoutdoors

---

**Wyll:** *I've known goblin raiders to slaughter entire villages and strip them for loot - but I've never seen one ravaged like this.*

**Gale:** *It's hard to imagine anyone who'd willingly inflict such devastation, be they zealots, marauders, invading armies... A sign of far worse to come, I fear.*
