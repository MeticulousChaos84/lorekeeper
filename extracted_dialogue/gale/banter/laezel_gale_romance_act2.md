# Party Banter: Laezel Gale Rom Act2

---

**Gale:** *So, Lae'zel - have you ever been tempted to use psionics in your, erm, romantic endeavours?*

**Lae'zel:** Only once. Did you know, In low-gravity settings, githyanki can maintain aerial suspension for hours at a time?

**Gale:** *Fascinating - I think the archmage Tasha described a spell with similar effect. I really must look that up...*
