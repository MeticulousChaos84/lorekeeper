# Gale & Astarion Banter

*Collected party banter between Gale and Astarion*

---

## Act 1

### Creche

*Gale/Astarion banter at the creche*

**Gale:** *I knew I should've attended the Blackstaff's lectures on githyanki tir'su.*

**Gale:** If I understood their script, who knows what secrets their texts would surrender...

**Astarion:** Why not ask one of the friendly bloodthirsty warriors? I'm sure they'd be happy to translate.

### Romance (Act 1)

*Romance banter reacting to player and Astarion Act 1 romance progression*

**Gale:** I see you waste no time pursing your quarry, Astarion.

**Gale:** Tell me, do you always woo your lovers with such patient attention?

**Astarion:** I rather thought I was a little slow this time. Usually, they're begging me to drain them on the first night.

## Act 2

### Romance (Act 2)

**Gale:** I fear I've been rather hasty to judge you, Astarion.

**Gale:** One heartbreak was quite enough for me, but to experience it as many times as you have must change a person.

**Astarion:** Thank you, Gale. Let us both hope that broken hearts are a thing of the past.

## Act 3

### Stormshore Tabernacle

*Gale/Astarion banter at the Basilisk Gate.*

**Gale:** Mystra has a shrine within the city. Located in the Stormshore Tabernacle, if my memory serves me.

**Astarion:** Do whatever you need to, but I shan't be paying my respects to any of the gods on show.

**Gale:** You never felt the call of the divine, Astarion?

**Astarion:** Oh, I tried them all. None of them answered.

### Romance (Act 3 - Spawn)

**Gale:** If you're feeling faint after your bout with Cazador, Astarion, I don't mind donating some blood.

**Astarion:** When you're still full of that Netherese bile? I'll pass, thank you.

**Astarion:** *Besides, I have someone else to nibble on. And they are delicious.*
