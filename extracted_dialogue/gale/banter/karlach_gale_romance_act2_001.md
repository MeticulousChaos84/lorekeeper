# Party Banter: Karlach Gale Rom Act2 001

---

**Karlach:** So, Gale - got any book recommendations for me?

**Gale:** You can read?!

**Karlach:** Very funny. Yes - I can read. School put me off big boring tomes. Sometimes I wonder what I'm missing.

**Gale:** Say no more - I'll find the perfect book for you. I might even lend it to you from my library in Waterdeep.

**Karlach:** Ooh! Something with magic, please. And no devils.
