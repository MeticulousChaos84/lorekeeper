# Party Banter: Gale Minthara Rom Act2

---

**Gale:** I'm glad to know you have a softer side, Minthara. I was beginning to think you rather heartless.

**Nightwarden Minthara:** Loving another is not soft, wizard. It is one of the hardest things a person can do.

**Gale:** So you admit you've found love! How delightful - I'm happy for you both.
