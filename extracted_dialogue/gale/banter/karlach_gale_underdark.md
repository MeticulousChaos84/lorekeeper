# Party Banter: Karlach Gale Underdark

**Karlach:** Just when I was getting used to the sky again...

**Gale:** Fear not, Karlach. Sun, moon and stars will still be there waiting for us.

**Karlach:** *Meanwhile, this place is pretty spectacular, isn't it?*

**Gale:** No book or painting could ever do its strange beauty justice. But perhaps our stories might, when we return to the surface.
