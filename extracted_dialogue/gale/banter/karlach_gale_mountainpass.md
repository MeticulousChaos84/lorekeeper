# Party Banter: Karlach Gale Mountainpass

---

**Karlach:** Man, adventuring is thirsty work.

**Gale:** There used to be a monastery in this region known for producing a wonderful ale.

**Karlach:** That sounds like heaven! Wait. Used to?

**Gale:** *Oh, yes - long ruined, I'm afraid. No chance of a frothing pitcher awaiting us there, but still - at least your thirst for knowledge is quenched.*

**Karlach:** *Ugh.*
