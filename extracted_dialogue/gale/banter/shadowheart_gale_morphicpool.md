# Party Banter: Shadowheart Gale Morphicpool

---

**Shadowheart:** The end must be near. No regrets, Gale? You may have been better off staying inside that boulder...

**Gale:** Unlikely. Had I stayed there much longer, the orb would have reduced it to rubble. Besides, think of all the fun I'd have missed out on.

**Shadowheart:** Fun? Well... yes. I suppose we did manage to make the best of things.
