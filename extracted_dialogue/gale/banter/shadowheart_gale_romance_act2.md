# Party Banter: Shadowheart Gale Rom Act2

*Banter between Shadowhear and Gale in Act 2*

---

**Gale:** When you've loved a goddess - as I have - people often think you less experienced in the ways of romance.

**Gale:** *It's true, for a time I neglected the physical in favour of celestial euphoria. But our relationship was no less real for it.*

**Shadowheart:** 'She just lives on another plane.'

**Shadowheart:** Only jesting. I'm in no position to judge - especially after what happened with Shar.

**Shadowheart:** Only jesting. I know all too well what it's like to pine after a goddess...

**Shadowheart:** Only jesting. I'm sure you're a force to be reckoned with.
