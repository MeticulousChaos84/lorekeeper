# Party Banter: Wyll Gale Guildhall

---

**Wyll:** It might seem a bit ramshackle, but this place has a boastworthy bar.

**Gale:** A bar is only as good as its cellars. Which vintages can we expect to find on their racks?

**Wyll:** Here, a bottle is judged more by its ability to crack heads than the quality of its contents.

**Gale:** Ah. If that's the main criteria then I shall reset my expectations accordingly. Water it is.
