# Party Banter: Laezel Gale Astral

*Lae'zel asks Gale what is interest is in the astral plane, and he equivocates.*

---

**Lae'zel:** Tell me, Gale: what is your interest in the Astral Plane?

**Gale:** Time. Or rather: the absence of it. In the Astral Plane, everything is eternal.

**Lae'zel:** It will be my home soon enough, should Vlaakith will it.
