# Party Banter: Wyll Gale Moonrisegeneral

---

**Wyll:** This is no aimless horde - the Absolute's forces are organised. What do you make of it, Gale?

**Gale:** All enemies have some chink in their armour, no matter how much they like to believe themselves invulnerable. That's what we must find.

**Wyll:** And if we don't find any clear weakness?

**Gale:** Then we hope our mutual strengths are enough to dominate them. Or, we die nobly in the attempt.
