# Gale & Karlach Banter

*Collected party banter between Gale and Karlach*

---

## Act 1

### Blighted Village

**Karlach:** Looks like this town was ransacked - by soldiers, if my eyes don't deceive me.

**Gale:** Quite cruelly, too.

**Karlach:** Must've been an awful day for the people who lived here.

**Gale:** If nothing else, I hope it was a mercifully short one.

---

### Toll House

**Karlach:** Whoa! Almost slipped there.

**Gale:** You wouldn't be the first, I'd wager. It's been some time since these walkways felt the carpenter's hammer.

**Karlach:** You gonna catch me if I eat a brick?

**Gale:** With my reflexes? I'd catch you before you so much as stubbed a toe.

---

### Mountain Pass

**Karlach:** Man, adventuring is thirsty work.

**Gale:** There used to be a monastery in this region known for producing a wonderful ale.

**Karlach:** That sounds like heaven! Wait. Used to?

**Gale:** *Oh, yes - long ruined, I'm afraid. No chance of a frothing pitcher awaiting us there, but still - at least your thirst for knowledge is quenched.*

**Karlach:** *Ugh.*

---

### Underdark

**Karlach:** Just when I was getting used to the sky again...

**Gale:** Fear not, Karlach. Sun, moon and stars will still be there waiting for us.

**Karlach:** *Meanwhile, this place is pretty spectacular, isn't it?*

**Gale:** No book or painting could ever do its strange beauty justice. But perhaps our stories might, when we return to the surface.

---

### Romance (Act 1)

*Gale had first stage of romance/attraction with player - not yet anything official*

**Gale:** Karlach... a hypothetical question for you:

**Gale:** If someone - not me, of course - detected a hint of romantic interest in them from another, unnamed individual, what might that someone do about it?

**Karlach:** Whoever it is, just talk to them, Gale. And leave out the hypotheticals.

**Gale:** Talking. Right. I'm good at that.

---

## Act 2

### Last Light Shrine

**Gale:** A hidden shrine, dedicated to the Moon Maiden herself. Even amidst this darkness, Selunites are stubborn enough to cling on.

**Karlach:** Pretty beautiful, isn't it?

---

### Shadow-Cursed Forest

**Karlach:** Doing all right, Gale?

**Gale:** Oh, you know... Still alive and kicking, despite being surrounded on all sides by an endless manifestation of darkness and decay...

**Karlach:** I feel it too. Here if you need a pick-me-up.

---

### Moonrise Approach

**Karlach:** Ready to enter the belly of the beast?

**Gale:** It's the stairs I'm dreading. I shall close my eyes, and pretend I'm climbing my own, far superior tower in Waterdeep.

**Karlach:** In that case, welcome home.

---

### Moonrise Docks

**Karlach:** We're not taking a boat to Baldur's Gate, right?

**Gale:** And give the Absolute free reign to use us as target practice from the banks? I think not.

**Karlach:** Phew. My mum always said the Chionthar was unlucky.

---

### Reithwin Brewery

**Karlach:** Huh. A brewery. Why does Reithwin Ale ring a bell?

**Gale:** It was known to be quite the tipple - a cask or two still exists, if you know the right alekeep...

**Karlach:** You must have good taste. Not me. Can't afford it.

**Gale:** A common misconception. Even the simplest of flavours are elevated by the choice to appreciate them. Don't deny yourself such pleasures.

---

### Romance (Act 2)

**Karlach:** So, Gale - got any book recommendations for me?

**Gale:** You can read?!

**Karlach:** Very funny. Yes - I can read. School put me off big boring tomes. Sometimes I wonder what I'm missing.

**Gale:** Say no more - I'll find the perfect book for you. I might even lend it to you from my library in Waterdeep.

**Karlach:** Ooh! Something with magic, please. And no devils.

---

## Act 3

### Sorcerous Sundries

*Gale/Karlach banter at the Sorcerous Sundries.*

**Gale:** Look around you. Indulge your curiosity. Sorcerous Sundries is the finest purveyor of magical miscellany for miles around.

**Karlach:** Where's the axes?

**Gale:** What they sell is far more precious than mere sword or shield. They sell knowledge, ingenuity, the wisdom of mages past.

**Karlach:** Sounds like more your thing than mine.

---

### Blushing Mermaid

**Karlach:** Man, it's good to be home. First round on who?

**Gale:** She who thirsts buys drinks the first.

**Karlach:** You won't pin me down with a rhyme, wizard!

**Gale:** She who declines gets the worst of the wines.

---

### Romance (Act 3)

**Karlach:** How's the orb treating you, Gale?

**Gale:** Oh, quite well as a matter of fact. Since it was stabilised, it's been humming along nicely.

**Gale:** I have noticed one adverse side-effect. I seem to be losing hair in some, er, unexpected places.

**Karlach:** I can only imagine.
