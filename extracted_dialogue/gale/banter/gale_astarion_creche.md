# Party Banter: Gale Astarion Creche

*Gale/AStarion banter at the creche*

**Gale:** *I knew I should've attended the Blackstaff's lectures on githyanki tir'su.*

**Gale:** If I understood their script, who knows what secrets their texts would surrender...

**Astarion:** Why not ask one of the friendly bloodthirsty warriors? I'm sure they'd be happy to translate.
