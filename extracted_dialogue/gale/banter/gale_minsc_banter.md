*Collected party banter between Gale and Minsc*

## Act 3

### House of Hope

*Minsc and Gale enter House of Hope*

**Minsc:** Gale! You will perhaps able to explain where Boo has not - what exactly is the difference between a devil and a demon?

**Gale:** A fascinating question, one that boils down to which criteria we choose to apply. Are we speaking about the physiological? Theological? Etymological?

**Minsc:** *Eh. Just how-to-kill... -ical.*

**Gale:** Oh. Then for your purposes, they are exactly the same.

### Sorcerous Sundries

*Gale offers protection to Minsc in the Sorcerous Sundries shop*

**Minsc:** Minsc has never trusted places such as this. Too much of a wizard's power can be simply packaged and picked up.

**Minsc:** *Well, picked up by all but Minsc. When he touches the many delicate little jars, oh how the wizards shout and stare!*

**Gale:** *Fear not, Minsc. You have a wizard at your side who positively encourages such curiosity. You'll fit right in.*

**Minsc:** Obliged, wizard. Should we find our way to a weaponsmith, Minsc will rough you up a little - so that you too can fit in.

### Water Queen's House

*Minsc remembers how he tried to blow the Waterdeep conch*

**Minsc:** Umberlee - her clerics possess a nasty streak as wide as her oceans.

**Gale:** So their reputation suggests - especially among the good folk of Waterdeep. I'm curious to learn how you fell foul of them...

**Minsc:** *'Blasphemy', said the temple priestess. But Minsc says: do not give horns to your statues if you do not wish the visitors to try and make them toot.*

**Gale:** Yes, that would probably do it.

### Romance (Act 3)

**Minsc:** Gale. Minsc worries you might send a fireball up his butt, with all of this stringy hair in your face.

**Gale:** Is that why you keep your head shaved? I assumed it was a custom of some sort.

**Minsc:** Oh, no! Most warriors of Rashemen wear long battle-braids, weighed down with stone. Minsc can show you, when next we camp?

**Gale:** Thank you, but I'm more wizard than warrior. I'm not sure my scalp would stand up to such a plaiting.
