# Party Banter: Karlach Gale Brewery

---

**Karlach:** Huh. A brewery. Why does Reithwin Ale ring a bell?

**Gale:** It was known to be quite the tipple - a cask or two still exists, if you know the right alekeep...

**Karlach:** You must have good taste. Not me. Can't afford it.

**Gale:** A common misconception. Even the simplest of flavours are elevated by the choice to appreciate them. Don't deny yourself such pleasures.
