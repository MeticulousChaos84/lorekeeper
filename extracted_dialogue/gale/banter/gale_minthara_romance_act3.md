# Party Banter: Gale Minthara Rom Act3

---

**Gale:** I found an empty bottle of venom in camp, Minthara. Safe to assume it was yours?

**Nightwarden Minthara:** Indeed. I have been dosing my partner while they sleep by my side.

**Nightwarden Minthara:** They refuse to take it in their food, but I must build up their immunity in case we ever visit Menzoberranzan together.

**Gale:** Let's never speak of this again.
