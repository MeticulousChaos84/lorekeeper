**Context:** Automated dialogue when Gale Avatar's condition worsens after traveling without consuming magic items. These are fallback barks if he's in combat and can't have a full cinematic dialogue.

## First Time Worsening

**Gale:** Ugh... I'm fading. I need a pick-me-up. Something with the essence of the Weave.

## Second Time Worsening

**Gale:** Ah... can't go on much longer. I need to feel the Weave... a magic item - *something*.

## Repeated Worsening

**Gale:** Hells, I need a magic item - *now*. Anything that the Weave flows through.
