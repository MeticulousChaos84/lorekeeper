## Pain and Discomfort Barks

**Gale:** I'm feeling rather unsteady...

**Gale:** Deep breaths, Gale. Hold it together.

**Gale:** I'd be rather enjoying this journey, were I not wracked with pain.

**Gale:** One step in front of the other, Gale.

**Gale:** Ugh, I feel rotten.

**Gale:** I don't feel right. Not even close.

**Gale:** Getting weaker by the moment.

**Gale:** Feeling more unwell than ever.

**Gale:** What I wouldn't give for some respite.

**Gale:** Gods, this is bloody uncomfortable.

**Gale:** I hope I don't deteriorate further.

**Gale:** Struggling more with every moment.

**Gale:** My condition's only getting worse.
