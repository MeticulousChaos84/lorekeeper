## Early Stage Relief (First Item)

**Narrator:** *The magic you just consumed floods your body, dampening the necrotic power lurking within. You exhale in relief.*

**Narrator:** *You breathe a little easier. The magic you consumed has staved off the dark hunger within you - for now.*

## Moderate Relief (Second Item - Early)

**Narrator:** *The magic you just consumed quells the necrotic hunger lurking within. You let out a sigh of relief.*

## Moderate Relief (Second Item - Later Stage)

**Narrator:** *The orb settles within you. It is sated, yet dissatisfied - a disturbing development, but one you need not act on, for now.*

## Diminishing Returns (After Multiple Items)

**Narrator:** *The magic you consumed offered some relief, but the necrotic power within you is still hungry. You need more.*

**Narrator:** *The magic you consumed gives a small amount of relief, but the necrotic power within shall soon gnaw at you again.*

## Ineffective (Late Stage)

**Narrator:** *The magic you consumed did almost nothing to help you. Something's wrong.*

**Narrator:** *Though the item was enough to quell the orb's complaints, it remains disturbed, disjointed. It will not be appeased by such fare much longer.*
