# Gale Origin: Magic Item Consumption Relief (Automated Dialogue)

**Context:** Automated dialogue barks when Gale Avatar consumes a magic item while in combat (fallback for when full cinematic can't play).

## Relief After Consumption (Early Stage)

**Gale:** Ah... much better. The Weave makes me feel like a new man.

## Reduced Effectiveness (After Two Items)

**Gale:** A little relief... but not much. The Weave seems *fainter* somehow. Is something amiss?

## Ineffective (After Three Items)

**Gale:** Hells, I felt almost *nothing* - the flow of the Weave was barely a trickle. There must be another solution.
