## Narrator Reminders (Cycling)

**Narrator:** *Given Gale's adamant insistence that he not be allowed to die, he's making quite a habit of it. Thank goodness he has you to bring him back...*

**Narrator:** *Gale's corpse is silent, but his silence speaks a thousand words: most of them to the tune of 'why haven't you resurrected me yet?'*

**Narrator:** *To say Gale keeps a tenuous grasp on his mortality would be an understatement. You know what he expects of you - to resurrect him. If only it didn't need to happen quite so often.*

**Narrator:** *Gale lies on the precipice of his own mortality once more. As might you, if you don't resurrect him soon.*

**Narrator:** *Gale's never been so quiet. Peaceful as it may be, you'd best not leave him like that for too long, or you'll never hear the end of it.*

**Narrator:** *If Gale were alive right now, he'd impress upon you the urgency of his resurrection. You might want to look into that.*

**Narrator:** *Gale's lifeless body hardly seems like the source of a cataclysmic, world-ending event, but it is beginning to smell a little.*

*(Follow-up:)* *The best resurrections are timely ones. Best not leave him there too long.*

**Narrator:** *Whatever death means for others, you know it means something far, far worse for Gale. And yourself, if he is not brought back to life.*
