## If Player Knew the Protocol

**Gale (when playing as Gale):** Hmm. Interesting workaround.

**Gale (companion reaction - protocol known):** Interesting workaround... though not one that can be counted on in all circumstances.

## If Player Didn't Know the Protocol

**Gale (companion reaction - surprised):** Interesting workaround... though not one that can be counted on in all circumstances.
