# Gale Origin: Death Protocol - The Flute and K'ha'ssji'trach'ash

**Context:** Using Gale's magical flute to summon the magma mephit K'ha'ssji'trach'ash, who will breathe fire on the letter to transform it into a scroll of true resurrection. The correct melody is D-E-A-D. The mephit speaks Ignan (fire elemental language).

## Attempting to Play a Tune (Performance Check)

### Success

*(Companion reactions vary:)*

**Lae'zel:** Inoffensive enough.

**Shadowheart:** Pretty tune. You're better with your mouth than I would have figured.

**Karlach:** Handsome *and* talented. Goodness me, I'm a goner.

**Astarion:** Bravo! I didn't think you had it in you.

**Wyll:** How lovely - a natural tunesmith!

### Failure

*(Companion reactions vary:)*

**Lae'zel:** Enough. I've heard sweeter sounds from a dying vrock.

**Shadowheart:** *Oofh*... wonderful rendition of a dying crow.

**Karlach:** That was... expressive?

**Astarion:** Just be grateful that my ears can't bleed.

**Wyll:** Ah, yes, that classic tune: 'Ode to a Shrieking Owlbear'.
