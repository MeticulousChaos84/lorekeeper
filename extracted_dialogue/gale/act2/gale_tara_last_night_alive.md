## The Conversation

**Tara:** Mr Dekarios! There you are!

**Tara:** I was curled up here quite comfortably when I was suddenly overcome with uneasiness. A tressym's intuition is rarely wrong. What's happened?

### If Gale crafted the Shadow Lantern

**Gale:** I indulged in some dark magic to create a Shadow Lantern.

**Tara:** You did *what*? What the devil has gotten into you?

**Tara:** You may as well leave your life lessons in a bucket, for all the good they do you.

**Gale:** You sound just like Mystra.

**Tara:** Good. Then she's speaking sense, at last.

**Tara:** Be *very* careful, Mr Dekarios. You're on a terrifying road. One misstep could be your last. And then I'd be - oh, terribly cranky.

### If Gale absorbed shadow power from a corpse

**Gale:** You've a keen eye, Tara. I drew power from a source of shadow magic.

**Tara:** You did *what*? What the devil has gotten into you?

**Tara:** You may as well leave your life lessons in a bucket, for all the good they do you.

**Gale:** I promise - these shadow powers will help us, even if they are... impure.

**Tara:** I'll believe it when I see it, and not a moment before.

**Tara:** Be *very* careful, Mr Dekarios. You're on a terrifying road. One misstep could be your last. And then I'd be - oh, terribly cranky.

### Alternative: If Gale explains he felt Mystra's presence

**Gale:** I think I felt Mystra's presence...

**Tara:** You did? Well that *is* a turn-up for the books. And what led her to grace you with her presence?

**Gale:** I indulged in some dark magic to create a Shadow Lantern. *[if crafted lantern]*

*or*

**Gale:** I drew power from a source of shadow magic. A corpse, to be specific. *[if absorbed power]*

**Tara:** You did *what*? What the devil has gotten into you?

**Tara:** You may as well leave your life lessons in a bucket, for all the good they do you.

**Gale:** The lantern will be useful to us. And I'll be sure to wield it carefully. *[if crafted lantern]*

*or*

**Gale:** Just because Mystra demands my life, doesn't mean I do her dirty work. I make my own choices. *[if resisted temptations]*

*or*

**Gale:** I know exactly what I'm doing. Taking the power I *deserve* to wield.

**Tara:** Is that so? Then we'd best hope you don't make any further miscalculations. We both know what happened the last time you took something you thought you deserved.

**Tara:** Be *very* careful, Mr Dekarios. You're on a terrifying road. One misstep could be your last. And then I'd be - oh, terribly cranky.

### Alternative: If Gale thinks Mystra misses him

**Gale:** I think she misses me.

**Tara:** Well, she has a funny way of showing it, doesn't she, considering what she's asked of you?

**Tara:** I trust you'll treat whatever she had to say with the required lashings of salt. Better to keep your own wisdom than hers, Mr Dekarios. Or better yet, keep mine.

---

### Alternative: If Gale deflects

**Gale:** A private matter. Nothing to concern yourself with.

*or*

**Gale:** Nothing you need to be concerned about.

**Tara:** Oh, but I do concern myself, Mr Dekarios. Even when you're being as annoying as you are now.

**Tara:** I trust you'll treat whatever she had to say with the required lashings of salt. Better to keep your own wisdom than hers, Mr Dekarios. Or better yet, keep mine.

*or*

**Tara:** I'll leave you to your secrets, Mr Dekarios, but allow me to remind you of a simple fact. We rarely hide that which we know is right.

---

### Alternative: If Gale resisted the temptations

**Gale:** I passed up an opportunity to serve Mystra's will. To give her a sign I've changed.

**Tara:** You did *what*? What the devil has gotten into you?

**Tara:** You may as well leave your life lessons in a bucket, for all the good they do you.

**Gale:** I have a strategy in mind. One that involves not willingly provoking Mystra's anger.

**Tara:** Is that so? Then we'd best hope you don't make any further miscalculations. We both know what happened the last time you took something you thought you deserved.

**Tara:** Be *very* careful, Mr Dekarios. You're on a terrifying road. One misstep could be your last. And then I'd be - oh, terribly cranky.
