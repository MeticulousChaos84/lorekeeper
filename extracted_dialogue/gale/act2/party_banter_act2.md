## Shadow-Cursed Lands - Forest

### With Karlach

**Karlach:** Doing all right, Gale?

**Gale:** Oh, you know... Still alive and kicking, despite being surrounded on all sides by an endless manifestation of darkness and decay...

**Karlach:** I feel it too. Here if you need a pick-me-up.

---

### With Wyll

**Wyll:** What a dismal forest. Monsters could be lurking behind any and every tree.

**Gale:** We'd be wise to fear the trees themselves. It feels like the forest itself longs for our destruction.

**Wyll:** Frustrating, that. Monsters, I can fight. But I can no more sever these shadows than I could the wind or the sun.

## Last Light Inn - Selûnite Shrine

### With Karlach

**Gale:** A hidden shrine, dedicated to the Moon Maiden herself. Even amidst this darkness, Selunites are stubborn enough to cling on.

**Karlach:** Pretty beautiful, isn't it?

---

### With Shadowheart (Loyal to Shar)

**Shadowheart:** Imagine being compelled to hide a shrine in a land that is *actively hostile* to you and your goddess. Utter pigheadedness.

**Gale:** Tenacity might be a kinder word for it.

**Shadowheart:** I'll leave the kinder words to the softer hearts.

---

### With Shadowheart (Rejected Shar)

**Shadowheart:** A Selûnite shrine. It would've made my blood boil, once, just to look upon this...

**Gale:** You are lucky to have left that anger behind.

**Shadowheart:** I don't know... the anger was simple. I understood it, found comfort in it. Now I don't know what to believe.

## Moonrise Towers - Approach

### With Karlach

**Karlach:** Ready to enter the belly of the beast?

**Gale:** It's the stairs I'm dreading. I shall close my eyes, and pretend I'm climbing my own, far superior tower in Waterdeep.

**Karlach:** In that case, welcome home.

---

## Moonrise Towers - General

### With Wyll

**Wyll:** This is no aimless horde - the Absolute's forces are organised. What do you make of it, Gale?

**Gale:** All enemies have some chink in their armour, no matter how much they like to believe themselves invulnerable. That's what we must find.

**Wyll:** And if we don't find any clear weakness?

**Gale:** Then we hope our mutual strengths are enough to dominate them. Or, we die nobly in the attempt.

---

### With Astarion

**Astarion:** Can't say I love what they've done with the place.

**Gale:** Unsurprising, really. Fanatical cultists tend to care more for ambience than aesthetics.

**Astarion:** Reason enough to put them all to the sword, I say.

---

## Moonrise Towers - Docks

### With Karlach

**Karlach:** We're not taking a boat to Baldur's Gate, right?

**Gale:** And give the Absolute free reign to use us as target practice from the banks? I think not.

**Karlach:** Phew. My mum always said the Chionthar was unlucky.
