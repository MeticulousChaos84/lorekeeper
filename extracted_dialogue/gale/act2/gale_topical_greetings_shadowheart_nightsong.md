## Shadowheart Spares Nightsong

**Gale:** What secrets does the aasimar promise to reveal, I wonder?

**Gale (to Shadowheart):** For your sake, I hope they are secrets worth their price. I wouldn't care to have Shar's wrath at my back.

**Gale (about Shadowheart):** Whatever they are, Shadowheart will pay dearly for them. Shar will make sure of it.

## Shadowheart Rejects Shar - Parents Saved

**Gale (to Shadowheart):** Your parents will soon be well again, and you will have much to catch up on. Something to look forward to, once the world is safe again.

**Gale (about Shadowheart):** A privilege to witness such a reunion. Shadowheart deserves to have her family restored, when Shar has taken so much from her already.

## Shadowheart Nightsong Meeting

**Gale (to Shadowheart):** Your head must be spinning, to learn such a truth. Dame Aylin's revelations can't have been easy to stomach, but know that you will not be alone, when the time comes to act upon them.

**Gale (about Shadowheart):** At least Shadowheart is armed with the truth now. May its keen edge draw forth whatever vengeance she desires.

## Shadowheart New Hairstyle

**Gale:** There's no more radiant sight than that of someone who's learned to love themselves anew.

**Gale (to Shadowheart):** Shadowed in name, but no longer in spirit. It suits you.

**Gale (about Shadowheart):** Shadowed in name, but no longer in spirit. It suits her.

## Shadowheart - Shar's Wrath

**Gale (to Shadowheart):** Shar may punish you, but she does not have claim on you any longer. Resisting her is a triumph in itself, however much it hurts.

**Gale (about Shadowheart):** Poor Shadowheart. The gods are nothing if not vindictive in their vengeance.

## Shadowheart Left Party After Temple

**Gale:** A pity Shadowheart chose to depart our company. I'd grown quite fond of that Sharran wit of hers.
