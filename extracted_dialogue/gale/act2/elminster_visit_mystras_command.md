# Elminster's Visit: Mystra's Command
*Act 2 - Camp Scene*

**Context:** After giving Gale at least one magic item and entering the Shadow-Cursed Lands, Elminster Aumar appears in camp bearing a message from Mystra.

## The Arrival

**Elminster:** Hmm, yes. This shall suffice.

*If Gale previously defeated Elminster (recognizing the simulacrum):*

**Narrator:** *Your previous encounter with the old wizard was most likely a simulacrum - the figure before you may well be too.*

*If Elminster arrives during camp rest:*

**Elminster:** Ah, finally he stirs. True adventurers get up with the lark, I always say, but if there are larks to be found in these lands, they must fancy themselves akin to nightingales. I took the liberty of enlisting your cadaverous co-traveller to revive you. You truly should take much better care of yourself, m'boy.

**Gale:** Elminster?

**Elminster:** The very same, Gale. And a fair bit miffed he is, too, finding himself forced to expose his best pair of boots to so many miles of country road on your behalf.

*Alternative: If Gale remains silent*

**Elminster:** Don't just gawp at me like the dregs of the fishmonger's stall - I've worn out quite some boot leather in order to track you down.

## Mystra's Message

**Elminster:** I was bid to spare neither time nor my own self to find you. *She* sent me, Gale. You know of whom I speak.

**Gale:** Mystra sent you? Why?

**Elminster:** Young man, has your sojourn away from Waterdeep washed away your decorum as well as your patience? But I suppose, after all the calamity that's been laid at your feet, you can be forgiven raw nerves and a sharp tongue...

*Alternative reaction:*

**Gale:** You underestimate me, Elminster. 'She' could be any number of acquaintances.

**Elminster:** But there is only one who truly counts, no? One whose favour you crave. One who knows the catastrophe that lurks 'twixt your ribs.

## The Charge

**Elminster:** Gale, m'boy, I've come to address a most pressing matter. I'll speak as plainly as I can, forswearing the accustomed frills that decorate my speech. Mystra - the message and the charge I bring you are hers.

You know where you went wrong, Gale. We needn't dwell on that here and now. But even so, you're to be given a chance of redemption.

**Gale:** Mystra would consider... forgiveness?

**Elminster:** She would consider what she considers to be forgiveness. Mystra is aware of the misadventures that have befallen you both. She knows of your strife with the Absolute, that most insidious of evils.

You must know that the Absolute is more dangerous than you can possibly conceive. It threatens all who live - even those who are undying. It threatens the gods, the Weave, the very fabric of the universe itself.

That is why I have come here to charge you, Gale, with its destruction. It is Mystra's belief that only you can.

**Gale:** You mean the orb. You mean I sacrifice myself.

**Elminster:** As you say.

*Alternative:*

**Gale:** You promised me plain talk, Elminster. Make it plainer still, or we're done here.

**Elminster:** The orb. That constant reminder of your past failings. The instrument of your slow, sad, *inevitable* destruction. It can instead redeem you.

*Alternative:*

**Gale:** I could possibly put an end to the Absolute - if you aided me.

**Elminster:** Alas, not the role I've been given in this particular tale. I am but a bare cameo compared to the part that you must play. You and the orb.

## The Orb's New Purpose

**Elminster:** Mystra has granted me the power to stop the clock, as it were, on the orb's rush to overpower you. Instead, you will be able to unleash its lethal combustion at will.

You must find the Heart of the Absolute, whatever that may be, and use yourself as the catalyst that will burn it from this world.

### Gale's Responses

**Option: Acceptance**

**Gale:** I am Mystra's servant. If this is what she asks of me, so be it.

**Elminster:** Your clear-mindedness is a testament to yourself, Gale.

**Option: Questioning the Cost**

**Gale:** That's the cost of Mystra's good graces? *Martyrdom?*

**Elminster:** Remember who she is, Gale. Mortal death is but a passing chapter to a goddess - and to those who win her favour. Whatever she can grant unto you is infinitely better than whatever you cling to now.

**Option: No Choice**

**Gale:** What other choice do I have?

**Elminster:** You could flee from Mystra's calling. Live the life of a hermit once again, and succumb to the orb all the same. Only, it will be a death without purpose.

It brings me no pleasure saying this, my friend, but such is Mystra's will. Yours must be the sacrifice that will undo the Absolute. And for your sacrifice, you will be redeemed - such is Mystra's promise.

**Option: Suspicion**

**Gale:** That's more magnanimous of her than I've grown accustomed to. The catch being?

**Elminster:** The catch being the exact definition of redemption in Mystra's eyes, and the labour you must undertake in order to attain it.

## The Charm

**Elminster:** With that, I've said my sorry piece, and need only bestow unto thee the charm I was bid.

My'Nahastra Mystra'Ryl. E'Deelion Thras'Anas'Tthra.

*[Elminster gestures towards Gale's heart with an open palm, moving his hand in a small circular motion, soothing the orb within with Mystra's charm.]*

It is done. Both charge and charm have been committed into your care.

*If Gale was late in providing magic items:*

A shame that we did not cross paths sooner. The orb's thirst for magic is now quenched, yet it already inflicted some damage while you tried to forge ahead. The ill effects may linger, I'm afraid. Not enough to hamper your mission, I hope.

---

## Parting Words

**Elminster:** Like moons make swell and wane the nescient seas, so too the sky-strewn gods ordain the tidal fates of mortal days.

And yet - a notion born in lonely hours - come ebb, come flow, come all that is beyond the breadth of our dominion: be a moon unto yourself.

Even the waves of fate can break upon the shores of will.

Farewell, my friend.
