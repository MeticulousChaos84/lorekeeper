## Entering the Shadow Cursed Lands

**Gale:** I've never seen such a concentration of shadow magic. We must forge on, but *carefully*. It will corrupt any who lack the power to control it.

**Gale:** It is the very antithesis of all the Weave stands for, a magic of confusion and corruption, drawn forth only by those desperate or damned enough to accept its degradations. Followers of Mystra - those who call on the true Weave - are expressly forbidden to indulge it.

---

### On Mystra's Domain vs Shadow Weave

**Gale:** Mystra's domain is the Weave, and the magic that courses through it. These shadows were drawn from another source, created by another goddess: Shar. Mystra cannot destroy it, even if she wishes to, but she can try to ensure her followers resist its temptations. Now, I think it's time we moved on to lighter subjects, before we too are lost to the darkness. Was there anything else?

---

### Could Gale Use Shadow Magic?

**Gale:** Aha. What an interesting question... *Technically*, of course I could dabble in such practices. I've yet to find a form of magic I'm not a born natural in wielding. As for whether I *should* wield it... that would rather depend on the circumstances. And how closely I felt Mystra was watching...

---

### On Magic's Inherent Morality

**Gale:** Not necessarily. Magic has no inherent morality - it's effect is entirely down to the inclinations of the wielder. Even Mystra herself abstains from passing judgement on those who use the Weave. Her job is to ensure magic *exists*, not to dictate the purposes to which it is applied. There's no denying a certain perfume of decay hangs over such dark magic, but that isn't to say it can't be put to good use. Or at the very least, neutral use.

## Last Light Inn / Haven

**Gale:** At last, we find a beacon of light amongst the darkness. And not a moment too soon - I'm quite ready for some respite.

---

## Moonrise Towers - Entering (Bomb Disarmed)

**Gale:** This is the seat of the Absolute's power. Whatever the 'Heart' is, it's connected to this place somehow. We must find out.

---

## Moonrise Towers - Entering (Bomb Still Active)

**Gale:** So, this is the seat of the Absolute's power? Every bit as vile as the cultists who flock here, by the looks of it.

---

## Moonrise Assault Begins

**Gale:** We must reach Ketheric. He will lead us to the Heart of the Absolute.

---

## Ketheric Escapes to Mind Flayer Colony

**Gale:** Time for us to take a rather literal 'leap of faith'.

---

## Entered Oubliette Through Prison

**Gale:** A fascinating structure. Made of living flesh, or merely a simulacrum? A question for another time - for now, we'd best focus on finding a way out.

---

## Mind Flayer Colony

**Gale:** Fascinating as our surroundings are, we must press on. If our runaway general is down here, the Heart of the Absolute will be too.

---

## Mizora in Pod - Released

**Gale (to Wyll):** Not entirely sure that was a wise decision. Better the devil you know, I suppose.

**Gale (about Wyll):** Not entirely sure that was a wise decision. Better the devil you know, I suppose. The one Wyll knows, at least.

---

## Mizora in Pod - Wyll Dies

**Gale:** I imagine Wyll thought he'd have longer to enjoy the perks of his powers. Such pacts always collect their dues in the end. His suffering has only just begun.

---

## Shar's Temple

**Gale:** I feel the Weave growing more distant by the moment. We walk Shar's path now - best we don't spend too long in her shadow.

---

## Shadowfell

**Gale:** Shar's domain is a far cry from Mystra's. The Weave's light is truly extinguished by such darkness.

---

## Lifted the Shadow Curse

**Gale:** I think we've done rather a good thing here. A welcome change, to gift this land a sliver of hope amongst so much despair.

---

## Halsin Leaves (Failed to Lift Curse)

**Gale:** Druids will always follow nature's purpose over any mortal threat. Halsin goes where he is needed, as must we.

---

## Halsin Recruited

**Gale:** A savvy move, recruiting Halsin to our cause. While I'm adept at *most* forms of Weave manipulation, druidic magic is not my area of expertise. He will make for a most useful option to have in reserve.

---

## Following the Drider

**Gale:** Gods, I hate spiders.
