# After Elminster's Visit

**Context:** Gale's internal reflections after receiving Elminster's message from Mystra - that he should destroy the Absolute by detonating the orb, sacrificing himself in the process.

---

**Narrator:** *Elminster's visit weighs heavy on your mind. His is a face you did not expect to see again.*

**Narrator:** *When you last saw him, you were in your prime. No orb. No tadpole. A mage of growing renown, all power, pride and potential - beloved by the goddess of magic herself.*

**Narrator:** *It's one thing to have fallen from such heights, but to have Elminster himself now witness your humilation is almost unbearable.*

## How Gale Processes His Feelings About Elminster

**Alternative 1: His disappointment cuts deeper**

**Gale:** *His disappointment cuts deeper even than Mystra's. He was your hero...*

**Narrator:** *While most know of Elminster the legend, few know him as you have. He plucked you from obscurity. Offered you his guidance. His faith. And most recently, his pity.*

**Alternative 2: Did he even try to intervene?**

**Gale:** *You wonder, did he even try to intervene on your behalf?*

**Narrator:** *Elminster has served Mystra loyally for centuries. If he has any doubts, he's keeping them close to his chest.*

**Alternative 3: Mystra must have forced his hand**

**Gale:** *He would never inflict such cruel terms on you. Mystra must have forced his hand.*

**Narrator:** *Mystra would no more forgive Elminster for defying her than she was willing to forgive you. His hands are tied. As, it seems, are yours.*

**Alternative 4: Doddering old fool**

**Gale:** *Doddering old fool. Trust him to leave the hard work to you.*

**Narrator:** *Elminster's a relic concerned only with preserving his own legend. He couldn't care less if this mission would rob you of your own legacy.*

**Narrator:** *Or, perhaps it's Mystra who fears she will be erased. The Heart of the Absolute not only threatens mortal life. It threatens her too.*

## The Stakes of the Task

**Narrator:** *The stakes of the task ahead are clear. The Absolute threatens more than Faerûn. It threatens the goddess of magic herself.*

## How Gale Responds to His Mission

**Alternative 1: Academic reflection on Netherese magic**

**Gale:** *You think on the Netherese magic affecting your tadpole. A magic Mystra abhors...*

**Narrator:** *The last great threat to Mystra's role as protector of the Weave was at the hands of the Netherese wizard, Karsus.*

**Narrator:** *His empire, Netheril, has long since crashed and burned, but traces of its magic still remain, if you know what to look for. Spells. Artefacts. Weapons...*

**Narrator:** *Whatever lies at the Heart of the Absolute, it's powerful enough to inspire the fear of the gods themselves. What else could it be capable of?*

**Alternative 2: Temptation and curiosity**

**Gale:** *To wield enough power to threaten a god. That would be quite something...*

**Narrator:** *Somewhere in these shadow-cursed lands lies a power great enough that Mystra dare not speak its true name.*

**Narrator:** *'The Heart of the Absolute'... You will find it where it beats, and learn exactly what she's afraid of.*

**Alternative 3: Dutiful acceptance**

**Gale:** *The Absolute must be stopped. If this is the only way, so be it.*

**Narrator:** *You've witnessed first-hand the Absolute's depravity. It's quite something to know you now have the power to wipe it from existence with a snap of your fingers.*

**Narrator:** *You'd die too, of course, but your name would live on. 'Gale of Waterdeep, the Light of Faerûn.' If only you might live to see it.*

**Alternative 4: Seeking redemption**

**Gale:** *You failed her once. You will not fail her again.*

**Narrator:** *Destroy the Heart of the Absolute, and you may yet turn your greatest mistake into your greatest triumph.*

**Narrator:** *Something stirs within you. Hope. There may yet be a chance of redemption for Gale of Waterdeep after all.*
