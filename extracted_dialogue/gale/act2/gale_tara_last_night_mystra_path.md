# Gale & Tara: Elminster's Letter (Mystra's Path)

**Context:** After Gale obeyed Mystra's sign and resisted using the dangerous shadow magic at the Shadowfell, Tara delivers a letter from Elminster that changes everything.

---

**Tara:** There you are, Mr Dekarios. I've been champing at the proverbial bit. I've something for you. A letter from Elminster himself. He was most insistent I give it to you immediately upon your return.

[Gale reads the letter]

**Narrator:** *The letter is written in Elminster's crabbed hand. And, given his usual verbosity, is rather succinct...*

**Elminster's Letter:**

*I see remaining optimistic as my duty - especially when I am not the one being asked to do the seemingly impossible.*

*Think carefully - exceedingly so. You know Mystra, as do I. I was not born an old man. I am all too familiar with what it's like to have a goddess fill your heart with longing.*

*If there is another way, I trust you can find it. It is not in your nature or mine to stop looking, to accept the first answer to any dilemma. Do what you can - put that mind to work.*

*Perhaps... perhaps that should have been your mission right from the start.*

**Narrator:** *Reading between Elminster's cramped lines, you can draw only one conclusion. He thinks you should defy Mystra's instruction, and refuse to use the orb.*

**Tara:** What is it, darling? You look rather pale.

## Alternative Conversation Paths

### Path 1: Gale shares the truth

[When Gale tells Tara that Elminster's changed his mind about the orb]

**Tara:** Aha! Mr Aumar can always be relied upon to bring a dash of good sense to proceedings. A shame he didn't *start* with that, but still. I hope you plan to heed his advice. Carefully, though. He seemed rather fidgety when he delivered his message. Mystra will have both of you in her bad books before long.

### Path 2: Gale deflects

[When Gale dismisses the letter as nothing important]

**Tara:** And I'm a displacer beast. However, I will not press you further. Your private correspondence is just that, technically. What kind of companion would I be were I to sneak a peek?

### Path 3: Gale expresses uncertainty

[When Gale says it's good news but sounds uncertain]

**Tara:** Good news. Well. That's good. Yes. Quite. I admit I was dreading what might be in that letter. There's been so much dreadful news lately. I won't pry for specifics, Mr Dekarios. Not when I can sneak a peek at your letter while you sleep. Speaking of which - you ought to get your rest. Quite another day ahead of you, I'm sure.
