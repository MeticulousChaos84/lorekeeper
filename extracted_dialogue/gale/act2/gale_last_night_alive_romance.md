---

## Opening - The Starlit Grove

*The player arrives in a secluded grove. Despite being somewhere in the Shadow-Cursed Lands, Gale has conjured a spectacular night sky streaked with aurora borealis. He sits on the ground gazing upward, then gestures to summon purple, pink, green, and yellow will-o-wisps that bathe the scene in mysterious light. The player approaches and sits beside him.*

**Gale:** I love this time of night. There's an almost reverent silence that accompanies the peak of darkness, when you'd almost believe the dawn will never break. The cradle of eternity. The timelessness of lovers. That most beautiful of fantasies.

It's breathtaking, is it not? The curse is still present of course - just veiled and at arm's length for now. Not a trick I can repeat often, but tonight? Tonight is different.

This may be my last night alive. I wanted it to be under a canopy of beauty and wonder... and with company to match.

I thought this place might bring me peace. I thought it might make the weight of what I must do feel a little lighter... but I am not so sure.

## On Death and Meaning

**Gale:** Babe or crone, coward or hero, death is assured. Mystra's forgiveness is not. If you knew the end was near, would you not want to ensure it had meaning?

*or*

**Gale:** I am trying. Believe me, I am. The path is set, and I will not stray from it - even as my heart quakes.

**Gale:** I am terrified - I will not claim otherwise. My face could scarcely conceal it even if my words sought to deny it. There is no point in running from the inevitable. Better to meet it, on my own terms.

### If challenged about his sacrifice:

**Gale:** Resigned to it, rather. But that is not to say I am without fear. Far from it.

*or*

**Gale:** I can only hope that there are few innocents within the Absolute's reach, when the time comes... and that you will seek safety, far away from me.

**Gale:** Stay with me a while, will you? Day will come all too soon, even in this place.

## Declaration of Love (Dating Path)

**Gale:** One moment with you could sate me for a lifetime, and prise the fear from my heart. I'm so very glad you came, to share this with me.

I know this is all unreal, but I created it for you. You must know that you're... That you're very special to me. If things were different, if we were home, I'd have taken the time to do things properly. To say it all better. But time is short.

I'm in love with you.

### Player response: *Lean in for a kiss.*

*The player and Gale kiss seated on the ground. It's relatively chaste.*

**Gale:** And you're a bad liar. I lived the life of a hermit for some time before I met you - safer for all, but not conducive to pleasures of the flesh.

*or*

**Gale:** A fair assessment - I wish we had more time to practice together.

*or*

**Gale:** Not if I have any say in the matter.

**Gale:** I want it to be perfect - to bond with you in the way that gods do... intertwining our spirits in visions of the Weave.

*Gale stands, a little animated as he describes the possibilities of magic love. The player stands.*

## The Choice: Illusion or Reality

### Path 1: Show me the magic ("Show me.")

**Gale:** How about the perfect night in Waterdeep? Yes... Let's imagine how it would be.

*Gale reaches out his hand to his side—fingers expanding on an invisible surface. Aurora-like energy spreads from Gale's hand, forming a wall. The player turns following the glow as it arcs around them until the shape of a room housing an expansive library is fully realized. There's furniture for study, a chaise lounge for rest, and a piano. Closed doors lead to a balcony with an as-yet-unseen view of Waterdeep. This is Gale's home and the heart of his studies.*

**Gale:** The scene is this: you and I stand in the room that is the centre of my universe. The sculptures, the paintings, the walls enlivened by the spines of a thousand books. The grand piano plays the Lliirian Suites all by itself, and as we look out beyond the arches that lead to the terrace, we see the weary sun take its daily dive into the sea.

*Gale strolls toward the balcony doors, past the piano. The piano starts to play as Gale passes, and the doors open as he approaches. He walks out onto the balcony, overlooking a Waterdeep marina silhouetted by a purple-skied twilight.*

**Gale:** My favourite spot. Many times, evening turned to night and back to daybreak once more while I sat here, lost in words.

*The player sits on a bench on Gale's balcony, enjoying the conjured sunset. Gale joins them, sitting on the player's left. A book and bottle of wine sit on a side table next to the bench.*

**Gale:** It's called 'The Art of the Night', and it details the first thousand nights of a newlywed king and queen.

*or*

**Gale:** On the contrary. No one is lonely when they have books - except perhaps the illiterate. This one here is called 'The Art of the Night'. It details the first thousand nights of a newlywed king and queen.

**Gale:** They turned everything they did into an art. The art of conversation. The art of taste, time honoured and newly acquired. The art of the body. The exploration and acceptance of the self and the other. The art of the night itself. I say we take a page from their book.

**Gale:** Then let's set the book aside and be blank slates on blank sheets, delightfully new.

*or*

**Gale:** I'm many things, but coy's not one of them.

*or*

**Gale:** Then we'll start writing the prequel.

**Gale:** What do you say?

**Gale:** The stars will be our bed. Come here.

*Gale leans over and grabs the book from the side table, opens it, and places it between himself and the player, then puts his hand on the open page closest to the player. The player follows suit by placing their hand on the page closest to Gale. Arms crossing, they stare into each other's eyes which, after a blink, glow with magic. A spectral third eye opens up on each of their foreheads.*

*Spectral fingers (belonging to a projection of Gale) emerge from the page between the player's fingers. When the magical hand makes contact with the player's, their physical hand remains on the page, and their own spectral hand is picked up.*

*Spectral Gale pulls the player's projection off the bench and into the air above their physical bodies. Buried in the heart of Gale's projection sits a dark orb.*

**Gale:** Why confine ourselves to the pleasures of mortal flesh? It is but one stitch in a vast tapestry. Let me show you more.

#### Option A: "Show me more. Show me it all."

**Narrator:** *Your bodies and minds weave together in a masterpiece of intimacy. Never have you felt such wonder, such love - as vast as the universe itself, and just as heavenly.*

*[Fade to black]*

#### Option B: Full scene continues

*Gale pulls the player's spectral form in for a kiss.*

**Gale:** When you wake, it will be back at our camp, back in our small, dirty, bloody patch of existence. But stay with me now. There are endless worlds out there. Countless ways to declare love. Infinite ways to express it. Too much for one night... but we shall try.

*The player kisses the dark orb at the heart of Gale, then kisses him passionately on the lips. Their fingers spread, their hands merge into one another. The two spectral figures are a tangle of arms caressing more perfect forms, exploring, merging into a singular shape, a divine being slowly spinning in the twilight air.*

*[Fade to black]*

### Path 2: The grounded choice ("I want to be with the real Gale - the man, not the fantasy/illusion.")

**Gale:** Are you sure...? I could conjure up any sight that you could dream of, and a few you could not. I could use the Weave to make us feel sensations beyond reckoning. I could do more than woo you. I could wow you.

**Gale:** Yes, you are. Trust me, I would know. Let's do it your way then. So long as it's with you.

*or*

**Gale:** The old ways then. If that is what you wish, so be it.

*Gale's finger snaps. The player and Gale have returned to a quiet night in the secluded grove. All illusions dispelled.*

*Gale gestures for the player to stand next to him and sit on what must be an invisible piece of furniture. The player walks over to him and looks at where they're supposed to sit and playfully feigns doubt before throwing their weight into the empty space. Below them a four-poster bed materializes in the same aurora-like magic materialization Gale used to produce his room.*

**Gale:** A small gesture towards your comfort.

*The player sits, pats the bed next to them inviting him to join. Gale joins the player on the bed. He puts his knee on the bed and goes for a kiss while lying down and putting the player on their back.*

*[Fade to black]*

## Alternative: High Approval, Non-Romance Path

**Gale:** Yes... but there is so much to live for, and so few moments in which to house it all. Damn you. Damn you for giving me so much to care about. Our friends, our adventures... this would have been so much easier if it was just me. But it isn't.

If there is a way - any way - to save all that's grown dear to me, I want to seize it. I just can't fathom what that might be, other than to fail Mystra and condemn the world.

Stay with me, will you? I don't want to think of it any more, but I don't want to be alone either.

*The player and Gale silently watch the stars. The scene fades out.*

## Additional Dialogue Variations

### On the inevitability of death:

**Gale:** I can feel it - ever since we set foot in this strange, corrupted land. The closer we get, the heavier my own heart becomes.

### On collateral damage:

**Gale:** Fewer than if the Absolute goes unchecked. I don't want to kill, and I don't want to die... but inaction will lead to bloodshed all the same.

### On fear:

**Gale:** Afraid? No, I am *terrified*. But fear or courage or reason cannot change the charge I've been given.

### On hope:

**Gale:** Thank you. But even if we do find another way, perhaps this is the *right* way. The end fate wishes for me.

**Notes:**
- If playing as Karlach before her second upgrade, some romance options lead to alternative dialogue acknowledging physical limitations
- Multiple player response options often lead to the same narrative outcome (consolidated with "or")
- The scene emphasizes Gale's fear of death contrasted with his acceptance of what he believes is his fate
