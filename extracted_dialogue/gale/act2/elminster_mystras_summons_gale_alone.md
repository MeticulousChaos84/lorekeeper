## The Encounter

**Weary Traveller:** Ho there, wanderer. Stay thy course a moment to indulge an old man.

**Gale:** Elminster?

**Weary Traveller:** The very same, Gale. And a fair bit miffed he is, too, finding himself forced to expose his best pair of boots to so many miles of country road on your behalf.

**Gale:** My sympathies for your wearied soles. Care to explain what you're doing? *or* Well, boots are made for walking. I believe a bard once said something similar. *or* Spare me the chagrin - I didn't ask for you to track me down.

**Weary Traveller:** I was bid to spare neither time nor my own self to find you. *She* sent me, Gale. You know of whom I speak.

**Gale:** Mystra? What does she want of me? *or* Don't keep me in suspense, Elminster.

**Weary Traveller:** Mystra, aye, m'boy. But what she wants is a matter better discussed in more comfortable environs. Knowing you, I'll wager your camp is a veritable home away from home. Lead the way - then I can rest these bones of mine for a spell, and you can learn all I have to share.

**Gale:** All right, let's go. *or* Head to my camp yourself. I'll join when I can.

**Weary Traveller:** Marvellous. Onward, then. *or* Perhaps I didn't convey the gravity of the situation, if you think you have better things to be doing. But very well, I shall see you there.

**Note:** This encounter leads directly to Elminster joining the camp, where he will deliver Mystra's command to Gale.
