# Last Night Alive - Gale's Internal Monologue

**Context:** Gale lies on his bedroll, restless. After receiving Elminster's letter with Mystra's instructions to detonate the orb, he re-examines his position regarding his own death.

---

## Path 1: If Gale Never Succumbed to Temptation

**Narrator:** *Another restless night beckons. Your mind flits from memory to memory, the deeds you've done and left undone in the wake of Mystra's instruction. Her presence haunts your every decision - the ones she would endorse, and those she would disdain. Defy her doctrines while she watches, and you would not be merely disobedient. You would be dangerous.*

---

## Path 2: If Gale Followed Mystra's Path (No Tadpole Powers)

**Narrator:** *Though the night is still, your heart feels quite the opposite. Elminster's letter has given you much to digest. Can it really be true? Does he believe Mystra's instruction is wrong?*

**Gale:** *He defies Mystra himself in saying so. He wouldn't do that without good reason.*

**Narrator:** *In all the years you've known Elminster, he's never once questioned his goddess' wisdom. For him to do so now... there must be something to this.*

### Alternative Response

**Gale:** *Elminster's an enigma. Who knows what games he's playing.*

**Narrator:** *None can truly know what goes on beneath Elminster's tattered old hat. Just because he has centuries worth of wisdom, doesn't mean he's direct, or honest, in sharing it.*

### Another Alternative

**Gale:** *Impossible. Elminster's utterly devoted to her.*

**Narrator:** *Elminster's life has been spent in unwavering service to Mystra. He worships her devoutly, as you once did. So why would he plant such doubts in you now?*

### Or

**Gale:** *It could be sabotage, an attempt to deny you your chance at redemption...*

**Narrator:** *Mystra chose you for this task, not Elminster. Could jealousy lie at the heart of his insistence that you intentionally fail in your duty?*

### Continuing

**Narrator:** *You finally appear to be winning back Mystra's favour, even her blessings. But appearances are not everything, and after all - she does not give without expecting in return.*

**Gale:** *She gives what she can. And you receive her aid gratefully.*

**Narrator:** *It brings you comfort, knowing that Mystra's hand rests on your shoulder. Though she remains aloof, she does not send you to your fate alone.*

#### Alternative Response

**Gale:** *Her gifts have their uses, but she still leaves the hard work to you.*

**Narrator:** *If the Heart of the Absolute is within reach, it's not because of her intervention. It's because of your efforts. Your struggle. Your life being put on the line.*

#### Or

**Gale:** *She forced her favours upon you. You owe her nothing.*

**Narrator:** *Your obedience cannot be guaranteed by such piecemeal rewards as Mystra deigns to give. She offers you only the chance, the hope of redemption. Would you really give your life on such flimsy promises?*

#### Or

**Gale:** *Useless trifles. She still keeps the Weave's true power for herself.*

**Narrator:** *Perhaps these favours are intended to appease you. To make you hunger for the even greater reward she will bestow if you continue to obey. She offers you only the chance, the hope of redemption. Would you really give your life on such flimsy promises?*

### The Critical Question

**Narrator:** *Are you truly ready to sacrifice yourself for her?*

#### Option 1: Refusing to Die

**Gale:** *No. If Elminster believes there's another way, so do you.*

**Narrator:** *Mystra's conclusion is based on a flawed assumption. The orb cannot be the only means of destroying the Absolute, though she may think it the most convenient. What that alternative may be, you have yet to discover. But you will discover it. Whether Mystra wants you to or not.*

#### Option 2: Defying Her Entirely

**Gale:** *You'll die on nobody's orders. Especially not hers.*

**Narrator:** *Mystra has forgotten how carefully mortals tend to their brief and fragile lives. And what lengths they will go to to protect them. You may yet have cause to remind her.*

#### Option 3: For Others, Not For Her

**Gale:** *Not for her, but for everyone else.*

**Narrator:** *Mystra's fate is none of your concern. But you will not allow mortal innocents to die by the Absolute's hand. Not when it lies in your power to prevent it. If the orb is the only way to ensure victory, you'll have no choice but to use it.*

#### Option 4: Accepting the Sacrifice

**Gale:** *You are.*

**Narrator:** *Your resolve is steady. It is not just Mystra you save with your sacrifice. Faerûn itself depends on you. You will not fail. Not again.*

## Path 3: If Gale Crafted the Shadow Lantern

**Narrator:** *For the first time since the orb sank its claws into your chest, you feel your pulse quicken with a familiar sensation. Power. In crafting the shadow lantern, you recaptured a taste of what you once had - the power to create, to compel, to imagine. It was exhilarating. And in Mystra's eyes, dangerous.*

**Narrator:** *Her presence haunts your every decision - the ones she would endorse, and those she would disdain. Defy her doctrines while she watches, and you would not be merely disobedient. You would be dangerous.*

## Path 4: If Gale Absorbed Shadow Magic from a Boss

**Narrator:** *For the first time since the orb sank its claws into your chest, you feel your pulse quicken with a familiar sensation. Power. Though the shadow magic you consumed is nothing compared to your old mastery of the Weave, it is novel. Exciting. And in Mystra's eyes, dangerous.*

**Gale:** *She has no right to interfere. You don't answer to her.*

**Narrator:** *That you still live and breathe is a miracle in itself. A sign that Mystra may be unwilling to directly intervene. Or is her silence merely the hope that you may yet follow the self-destructive path she desires, without the need to force your hand?*

### Alternative Response

**Gale:** *Dangerous or not, you need all the help you can get.*

**Narrator:** *Though the powers you gained are not savoury in their origin, that will matter little if they keep you, and the orb, in one piece.*

### Or

**Gale:** *You've been indulging yourself. No harm in that.*

**Narrator:** *Following your curiosity, wielding unknown magic... You feel more like yourself than you have in months. And who knows how long your 'self' has left?*

### Or (Guilt Path)

**Gale:** *She might be right. You've drawn powers from a grim source.*

**Narrator:** *The magic you called on will have its uses, but you can't shake the feeling you lost something of yourself in the bargain. Still, there is time yet to set your course straight. All may be forgiven, if you serve her as Elminster instructed.*

### Continuing After Shadow Magic

**Narrator:** *Each day brings you closer to finding the Heart of the Absolute. The source of Mystra's fear. And, for you, perhaps her forgiveness...*

#### Option 1: Refusing to Die

**Gale:** *She's going to be disappointed. You've no intention of dying.*

**Narrator:** *Mystra has forgotten how carefully mortals tend to their brief and fragile lives. And what lengths they will go to to protect them. You may yet have cause to remind her.*

#### Option 2: Learning More First

**Gale:** *You'll learn more about the Heart. Only then will you decide.*

**Narrator:** *You would not simply destroy something so valuable. To do so would be foolish, irresponsible even. You must learn more about the Heart of the Absolute. After all, such power could come in useful, in the right hands. Your own, for example.*

#### Option 3: For Others

**Gale:** *You will destroy the Absolute. Not for her, but for everyone else.*

**Narrator:** *Mystra's fate is none of your concern. But you will not allow mortal innocents to die by the Absolute's hand. Not when it lies in your power to prevent it. If the orb is the only way to ensure victory, you'll have no choice but to use it.*

#### Option 4: Accepting Sacrifice

**Gale:** *You will reward her faith in you. When the time comes, you will be ready.*

**Narrator:** *Your resolve is steady. It is not just Mystra you save with your sacrifice. Faerûn itself depends on you. You will not fail. Not again.*

## Path 5: If Gale Used Tadpole Powers

**Narrator:** *You try to rest, but the tadpole within you has other plans. It writhes and stretches, comfortable within your skull. As comfortable as you've become wielding it. Even at the height of your powers, you'd never have dreamed of commanding such a creature, or using its will to amplify your own. It's exhilirating, and in Mystra's eyes, dangerous.*
