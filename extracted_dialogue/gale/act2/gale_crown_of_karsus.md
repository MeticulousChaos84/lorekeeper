## The Discovery

**Narrator:** *You read the words, written in Karsus' own hand, and yet you can still scarcely believe it. The Crown of Karsus... You've read of such an artefact, but always in veiled terms, couched in myth and rumour. Never as a reality.*

**Narrator:** *Could this truly be the crown you saw on the brain, surging with corrupted Netherese magic? If it is indeed Karsus' fabled creation, what else could it be capable of?*

## Alternative Responses

### Path 1: Temptation

**Gale:** *A familiar feeling rises within you. Temptation...*

**Narrator:** *This could be the answer to your prayers. A gift unlike any your goddess has been willing to give.*

**Narrator:** *Reforge it, and you would carry the most powerful artefact in the realms. A better fate than the one Mystra offered you.*

**If Gale has met Elminster:**

**Narrator:** *She's aware of your discoveries - Elminster's visit betrays that much. What else does she know? What else hasn't she told you?*

**If made a deal with Raphael:**

**Narrator:** *Between the Heavens and the Hells, the fate of the Crown hangs in the balance, and you will be the one to decide it.*

**Otherwise:**

**Narrator:** *It's time you sought out her shrine. There, she will acknowledge the secrets she's kept from you. And this time, she will not deny you anything.*

**If has NOT met Elminster:**

**Narrator:** *It's time the Mother of All Magic heard what you have to say. Time for you to find her shrine, and claim a long-witheld audience.*

**Narrator:** *Whatever secrets Mystra keeps from you, she will surrender them. She has no choice, now the Crown of Karsus is almost within your reach.*

### Path 2: Recognizing Corruption

**Gale:** *Such power leads to only one outcome. Corruption...*

**Narrator:** *In taking control of the Crown, the Dead Three's Chosen enslaved an elder brain, infecting half the Sword Coast with tadpoles. And that was without a true understanding of Karsus' powers.*

**If made a deal with Raphael (and contract not destroyed):**

**Narrator:** *Destroy the crown without first destroying your contract with Raphael, and there will be hells to pay. The devil will make sure of that.*

**Narrator:** *Destroy it, and the world would be a safer place. No doubt this is the course Mystra hoped you would follow, while keeping you ignorant of your true purpose.*

**Narrator:** *It's time you sought out her shrine. There, she will acknowledge the secrets she's kept from you. And this time, she will not deny you anything.*

### Path 3: Pragmatic Assessment

**Gale:** *Nothing, unless you can find a way to defeat the elder brain...*

**Narrator:** *Whatever the Crown's potential, for now it is impossible to detach from its wearer. So long as the elder brain lives, Karsus' Crown will never be yours.*

## The Path Forward

**Narrator:** *The orb, the parasite, and now the Crown... Netherese magic haunts you at every turn. It's time you understood its full potential.*

**Narrator:** *Sorcerous Sundries must be your next port of call.*

**Narrator:** *If there is more to discover about Karsus' creations, their shelves are your best hope of finding it. And once you've learned his secrets, your prayers may finally be answered.*
