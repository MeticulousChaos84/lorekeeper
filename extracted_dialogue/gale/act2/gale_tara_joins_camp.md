**Synopsis:** Tara rejoins Gale, offering him a magic item and reminding him of his plight.

---

**Narrator:** *Sleep is a hazy oasis on the far side of a desert of worry.*

**Narrator:** *You know exactly what this illithid parasite will do to you. Within seven days, you'll become a mind flayer.*

**Narrator:** *But what about the bomb in your chest? Ceremorphosis is likely to destabilise it. What then?*

**Gale:** *Consider that it'll explode, flattening an area larger than Waterdeep.*

**Narrator:** *You imagine the explosion. Thousands will die. You have to stop it - ceremorphosis and the orb itself.*

**Narrator:** *You'll need to drain magical energy from a powerful artefact soon. As you contemplate your hubris, your eyelids grow heavier and heavier...*

**Tara the Tressym:** Excuse me, Mr Dekarios. Mr Dekarios. Yoo-hoo!

**Tara the Tressym:** Destiny is at your door; won't you at least twitch the curtain?

**Gale:** Tara! Is that you?!

**Tara the Tressym:** Well, it isn't the Mother of All Magic, lucky for you. You look terrible. Are you eating?

**Gale:** I can look after myself, Tara. *OR* Goodness, I'd forgotten. Thank the gods you reminded me before I starved to death. *OR* In fact, I think I feel as bad as I look.

**Tara the Tressym:** I have my doubts. But first things first... *OR* I won't be teased, heckled, pestered, or vexed, Mr Dekarios. Not before I've had my due. *OR* No matter, Mr Dekarios. Tara's here now, and she'll sort you out. But first, my payment.

**Tara the Tressym:** Ahhh, that's it. No one manages the nuances quite like you.

**Gale:** Dare I ask what you're doing here?

**Tara the Tressym:** Making sure you keep on the straight and narrow, as is my task in this weary life.

**Tara the Tressym:** I looked away for a moment, just once, and look where it got us. You, a living doomsday device. The shame.

## Alternative: It's Good to See You

**Gale:** It's good to see you, Tara. I've missed you very much.

**Tara the Tressym:** And I you, of course. The tower just isn't the same without you stomping about in the background.

**Tara the Tressym:** So here I am, come to re-insert myself. After all, remember what happened last time I let you out of sight?

**Tara the Tressym:** Of course you do. You're still paying the price with that ticking time bomb in your gullet. Ugh, the indignity.

---

## Alternative: Don't Get Used to It

**Gale:** Don't get used to it. You need to go back to Waterdeep. Now.

**Tara the Tressym:** Wizards ask questions, they don't issue imperatives. You ought to know that by now, Mr Dekarios.

**Tara the Tressym:** But I suppose your case is worse than I thought. All the more reason for me to stay and keep an eye on things. We wouldn't want you to make another apocalyptic mistake, would we?

## Continues from All Paths

**Narrator:** *Nestled amongst your books and papers, Tara bore witness to your greatest triumphs... and your greatest failure.*

**Narrator:** *You made yourself a walking cataclysm, the annihilation brewing within you just about held at bay by your constant consumption of magical objects. Tara saw it all, but never left your side.*

**Tara the Tressym:** Speaking of which - I brought you something. For your tummy troubles.

**Narrator:** *A ring, coursing with magic. The Netherese orb within you shudders, longing to consume, to devour... It must be satisfied.*

**Tara the Tressym:** We have a great deal of catching up to do. Eat that, have a wash and, for the love of all that's dear, a shave. Then you can fill me in on what I've missed.

### Option 1: Thank You

**Gale:** Thank you, Tara. I really needed this.

**Tara the Tressym:** Of course, Mr Dekarios. What else are friends for?

**Tara the Tressym:** Now eat up! If you explode and kill us all, I'll be furious.

---

### Option 2: It's Dangerous

**Gale:** I'm not sure, Tara. It's dangerous out here.

**Tara the Tressym:** All the more reason I ought to be looking after you.

**Tara the Tressym:** Anyway - incidentally - I was getting very bored without my friend.

**Tara the Tressym:** Now eat up! If you explode and kill us all, I'll be furious.

---

### Option 3: How Did You Find Me?

**Gale:** How did you find me?

**Tara the Tressym:** Handy little spell I've been working on. 'Tara's Catflap of Displacement.' I haven't worked out all the kinks, but I'm starting to be able to find my way around.

**Tara the Tressym:** It is terribly good to see you, Mr Dekarios.

**Tara the Tressym:** Now eat up! If you explode and kill us all, I'll be furious.

## Alternative Opening Responses to Tara

### Well, Well, Well

**Gale:** Well, well, well. Look what the tressym dragged in.

**Tara the Tressym:** I know, I'm looking exceptionally well. You, on the other hand - how the tidy have fallen. Are you eating?

*(Continues to scratching scene)*

### You Promised

**Gale:** You promised to stay in Waterdeep. 'Promise,' verb, meaning *to swear something will or will not be done.*

**Tara the Tressym:** And I decided 'will not'. And a good thing, too. You look like you haven't had a good meal in days.

**Tara the Tressym:** Well, it isn't the Mother of All Magic, lucky for you. You look terrible. Are you eating?

*(Continues to scratching scene)*

## Hostile Path (Excluded from extraction but noted for reference)

**Gale:** You need to go home - now. And that's final.

**Tara the Tressym:** I don't take orders from my masseuse. Eat up, now. And chat soon.

*(Scene ends)*
