## The Encounter

**Weary Traveller:** Ho there, wanderer. Stay thy course a moment to indulge an old man.

**Gale:** Elminster?

**Weary Traveller:** The very same, Gale. And a fair bit miffed he is, too, finding himself forced to expose his best pair of boots to so many miles of country road on your behalf.

### Optional: Introductions

**Player:** I think some proper introductions are in order.

**Gale:** Meet Elminster Aumar. A good friend of mine, but rather more significantly, he's the most famed and respected wizard in the realms.

**Weary Traveller:** Am I, indeed? Most famed and respected errand boy, more like.

### Optional: Origins

**Player:** Many miles, you say. Where do you hail from?

**Gale:** Originally? Shadowdale. Lately? The fanciest inns of Waterdeep.

## The Purpose Revealed

**Gale:** Yes, yes, yes, be that as it may, you said you came all this way on my behalf, did you not? For what purpose?

**Weary Traveller:** I was bid to spare neither time nor my own self to find you. *She* sent me, Gale. You know of whom I speak.

**Gale:** But why? Out with it, Elminster. Please!

**Weary Traveller:** Young man, has your sojourn away from Waterdeep washed away your decorum as well as your patience? Nigh a tenday I've gone without honest fare worthy of the name - drank naught but what the sky entitled my thirst. Why, some bread, cheese, and a cup of wine would appear unto me a feast! Surely you won't begrudge me a mite of rest and repast before I get 'out with it'?

**Player:** Yes, Gale. Where *is* your decorum? *or* I suppose we could part with a few of our rations.

**Gale:** Oh, for the love of...

**Weary Traveller:** This way, then, hmmm, to your camp? Don't dawdle now, lad. You're the one who's in such a frightful hurry. *or* And a great kindness that would be! See, Gale? Even in these barren parts, the art of hospitality begets inspired new works if one only keeps up the practice.

**Gale:** *[Aside to player, low enough that it wouldn't be heard by the departing Elminster]* Nigh on thirteen centuries old and he still thinks with his stomach. We'd best follow, and see if he's more disposed to speak plainly once it's stopped its grumbling.

**Player:** Very well. I suppose I'm as curious as you are to hear what he has to say. *or* We'll meet him in camp later. Let him have his rest and repast in the meantime.

**Gale:** A wise choice. Better to indulge our curiosity than Elminster's appetite. *or* There go our best supplies.

**Note:** This encounter leads directly to Elminster joining the camp, where he will deliver Mystra's command to Gale.
