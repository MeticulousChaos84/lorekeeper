**Gale:** My condition likes being ignored as little as I do. I must consume another artefact. And soon.

**Gale:** My condition is worsening again. I need to consume some powerful magic, or it may become volatile.

**Gale:** I know we have other things on our mind, but please - do not neglect my request. It is most, *most* urgent.
