# Gale's Reactions to Astarion's Vampire Reveal

**Source:** `Gale_InParty2_Nested_AstarionReveal.html`

**Context:** Various scenarios where Gale discovers or confronts Astarion about being a vampire.

---

## Scenario 1: Witnessed Astarion Bite Someone Else in Combat

**Gale:** I've had my suspicions about you for some time now. And there you go, confirming them with truly audacious gusto. You're a *vampire.*

---

## Scenario 2: Gale Was Bitten by Astarion in Combat

**Gale:** Aha! I *knew* it. I knew you'd try something like that eventually. Though I wish you'd done it with a bit less enthusiasm. Still, I can hardly blame a vampire for being true to its nature. You *are* a vampire, are you not?

**Astarion:** I am. But I'm a friendly one - I promise.

**Gale:** There was nothing friendly about what you just did to me. But I'll humour you - we'll call that a momentary lapse in good sense, shall we?

---

## Scenario 3: Astarion Attempted to Bite Gale During Camp Night

**Gale:** I thought I'd awaken feeling, well, *drained*. But I seem to be quite as well as ever. Admittedly, that's not saying much given our ongoing predicament. Nonetheless, I'm glad I woke up when I did. As I said, I'm willing to move past the whole exsanguination issue, so long as you can promise to keep that hunger of yours in check.

### If Astarion Thanks Him for Trust

**Astarion:** Thank you for trusting me.

**Gale:** I know what it is to have an uncontrollable hunger within you. You can hardly be blamed for your desperation in trying to satisfy it.

**Gale:** So, we move forwards. And when the occasion arises, we show our enemies *exactly* how sharp those teeth of yours can be.

### If Astarion Promises to Feed Only on Foes

**Astarion:** I promise you - I'll sate myself on our foes alone from now on.

**Gale:** A choice both efficient and pragmatic. Most unlike you.

**Gale:** So, we move forwards. And when the occasion arises, we show our enemies *exactly* how sharp those teeth of yours can be.

### If Astarion Promises to Resist

**Astarion:** I'll resist with all my strength.

**Gale:** Well then - let's hope you've strength to spare.

**Gale:** So, we move forwards. And when the occasion arises, we show our enemies *exactly* how sharp those teeth of yours can be.

## Scenario 4: Astarion Attempted to Bite Another Companion During Camp Night

**Gale:** And how are you this morning, my blood-thirsty friend? If you'd had your way our number would be one fewer by now. We're fortunate you were caught red-fanged. Still, there was no real harm done. So long as you can keep that craving of yours in check, I'm happy that our paths remain aligned.

### Response Options

**Astarion:** Thank you for trusting me.

**Gale:** I know what it is to have an uncontrollable hunger within you. You can hardly be blamed for your desperation in trying to satisfy it.

**Gale:** So, we move forwards. And when the occasion arises, we show our enemies *exactly* how sharp those teeth of yours can be.

*[Alternative responses lead to same conclusion as Scenario 3]*

## Scenario 5: Gale Confronts Astarion in Act 2 (No Prior Reveal)

**Gale:** I think it's about time you and I had a little chat. An honest one. At first I wasn't sure. Some of your behaviour doesn't exactly match what my traveller's tomes describe of one of your... disposition. The ability to walk in broad daylight, for example, with not a burn in sight. I suppose we have your parasite to thank for that. But as for the rest - well, there can be only one conclusion. You're a *vampire.*

### If Astarion Clarifies He's a Spawn

**Astarion:** *Technically* I'm a vampire spawn.

**Gale:** Do not undersell yourself, you may not have the grand lair nor loyal swarm but a vampire spawn is still part of the vampire family. *Technically.* The real conundrum here is why weren't you honest with me? I'm quite open-minded. It's one of my finer qualities, and there's some stiff competition in that department.

#### Option A: Astarion Explains Caution

**Astarion:** There's open-minded, and then there's 'happy to sleep next to a vampire spawn.' I didn't think you'd like it much.

*[Persuasion Check - DC 14]*

**Success:**

**Gale:** Nothing wrong with a bit of caution, I suppose. Better to sound out friends and enemies alike before revealing that kind of secret. With that said, I'm more than happy to continue onwards. But no more hiding things from me. Agreed?

**Astarion:** I can promise you *fewer* secrets?

**Gale:** *Sigh.* I suppose that will do for now. But none that pose the threat of imminent death or destruction, for me, or yourself, or anyone else for that matter. Now, unless you've any other deep, dark secrets to own up to, shall we continue on?

*Or:*

**Astarion:** No more secrets, on my honour.

**Gale:** You almost said that without smiling. Now, unless you've any other deep, dark secrets to own up to, shall we continue on?

*Or:*

**Astarion:** *Say nothing. Stare into Gale's eyes, unblinking.*

**Gale:** I'll take that as a no, shall I? *Sigh*. It was worth a try. Now, unless you've any other deep, dark secrets to own up to, shall we continue on?

**Failure:**

**Gale:** I can tell you what I don't like. Unwittingly sleeping next to someone with a taste for blood and a tendency to lie about it. I'm happy to draw a line under the matter and move forward. But from here on, no more hiding things from me. Agreed?

*[Proceeds to same options as Success path]*

#### Option B: Astarion Claims Master's Curse

**Astarion:** I had no choice. My old master put a curse on me. Forbade me ever revealing my true nature.

*[Deception Check - DC 18]*

**Success:**

**Gale:** How tragic. Well, lucky for you your master couldn't predict the observational cunning of our troupe's resident Waterdhavian wizard. Your silence spoke volumes. With that said, I'm more than happy to continue onwards. But no more hiding things from me. Agreed?

*[Proceeds to response options from Option A]*

**Failure:**

**Gale:** I'm sure you could have found your way around that with a bit of imagination. I'm happy to draw a line under the matter and move forward. But from here on, no more hiding things from me. Agreed?

*[Proceeds to response options from Option A]*

#### Option C: Astarion Cites Trust Issues

**Astarion:** Most people don't react as well as you.

**Gale:** I can see the truth in that. But you and I aren't 'most people'. I don't care if you eat blood or boiled eggs for breakfast, but if we're to survive this parasitic adventure of ours, we have to trust each other. With that said, I'm more than happy to continue onwards. But no more hiding things from me. Agreed?

*[Proceeds to response options from Option A]*

### If Astarion Asks How Gale Figured It Out

**Astarion:** ...How did you figure that out?

**Gale:** Oh, it was quite easy, really. I took note of certain abilities you possessed, certain aspects of your behaviour depending on our environment. And those *teeth* of yours. Quite the pair of canines. The real conundrum here is why weren't you honest with me?

*[Proceeds to open-minded discussion and response options]*

### If Astarion Denies Being a Vampire

**Astarion:** Couldn't be further off the mark.

**Gale:** No need to deny it. The bat's out of the bag, so to speak. But why weren't you honest with me? I'm quite open-minded. It's one of my finer qualities, and there's some stiff competition in that department.

*[Same response options as "Open-minded" branch]*

**Astarion:** I'm telling you, I'm not a vampire.

**Gale:** I see. You're a *dishonest* vampire, and that's far worse. As you're not willing to engage in a frank conversation on the matter, I think we'll leave it there.

## Notes

- Gale consistently frames his acceptance around understanding "uncontrollable hunger" - a clear parallel to the orb
- He values honesty and openness, but is willing to be pragmatic about Astarion's secrecy
- He emphasizes the tactical advantage of having a vampire as an ally
- The "bat's out of the bag" line is peak Gale
- Persistent denial results in approval loss and conversation termination
