**Gale:** *Indistinct humming.* *(Duped and mirrored Performance Data)*

**Gale:** Be with you in a moment! *(Duped and mirrored Performance Data)*

**Gale:** Indulging in a spot of vanity. Handsome devil, aren't I? *(Duped and mirrored Performance Data)*

**Gale:** Not a trick, my friend. Magic! *(Duped and mirrored Performance Data)*

**Gale:** Be that as it may. *(He dispels the double with a flourish.)*

**Gale:** Ceremorphosis. What does it make you think of?

**Gale:** Spot on. Day one: fever and memory loss. Day two: hallucinations and greying skin. Day three: hair loss and blood leaking from all orifices. Need I go on?

**Gale:** Day four: excruciating pain as the skeleton and organs reform and reposition. Day five: the host's personality has disappeared. Fingers, toes and limbs elongate. I take it you get the picture?

**Gale:** Day six: the flesh around the mouth splits to make way for tentacles. Day seven: a mind flayer is born. This is the abridged version of course.

**Gale:** My point is this: our orifices remain blissfully unbloodied. Our heads remain clear, and our blood temperature normal. Any expert will agree: this is... abnormal.

**Gale:** I'll toast to that. The pragmatic in me, however, sees only the silence before the storm. Something to sleep on. We should get some rest.

## Alternative: If Player Dismisses the Explanation

**Gale:** Long story short then: Thanks to the tadpole, we should have developed more than invasive symptoms by now, but we haven't. Our orifices remain blissfully unbloodied. Our heads remain clear, and our blood temperature normal. Any expert will agree: this is... abnormal.

## Alternative: If Lae'zel Already Discussed This
---

**Gale:** I saw Lae'zel giving you a look-over. Great minds think alike. No doubt she came to the same conclusion: we're healthier than we should be. Any expert will agree: this is... abnormal.

## Alternative: Player Questions Gale's Expertise
---

**Gale:** Study. But what is happening, or rather not happening to us, is entirely undocumented. Uncharted territory. The silence before the storm.
