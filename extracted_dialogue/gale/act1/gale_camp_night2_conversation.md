---

**Gale:** *Indistinct humming.* *(Duped and mirrored Performance Data)*

**Gale:** Be with you in a moment! *(Duped and mirrored Performance Data)*

**Player:** What are you doing?

**Gale:** Indulging in a spot of vanity. Handsome devil, aren't I? *(Duped and mirrored Performance Data)*

---

## Alternative opening responses:

**Player:** Neat trick.

**Gale:** Not a trick, my friend. Magic! *(Duped and mirrored Performance Data)*

---

**Player:** All that wizardry makes me uncomfortable. *(Sorcerer/Warlock/Wizard)*

**Gale:** Whatever for? Look at him! Never too much of a good thing, I say. *(Duped and mirrored Performance Data)*

---

**Player:** Why are you studying your own mirror image? *(Warlock/Wizard)*

**Gale:** Indulging in a spot of vanity. Handsome devil, aren't I? *(Duped and mirrored Performance Data)*

---

**Player:** Typical. A wizard using magic just to admire his own beard. *(Sorcerer)*

**Gale:** A gentleman's only as dashing as his least groomed locus. *(Duped and mirrored Performance Data)*

---

**Player:** Make it dance. Oh, or breathe fire! *(Wild Magic Sorcerer)*

**Gale:** It's done all that and more at plenty a soirée, I can tell you. *(Duped and mirrored Performance Data)*

---

## Main Conversation Begins

**Gale:** Be that as it may. *(He dispels the double with a flourish.)*

**Gale:** Ceremorphosis. What does it make you think of? *(If Lae'zel hasn't been talked to yet)*

**Gale:** I saw Lae'zel giving you a look-over. Great minds think alike. *(If Lae'zel has been talked to)*

**Gale:** No doubt she came to the same conclusion: we're healthier than we should be.

---

## Alternative conversation openings:

**Player:** First and foremost: that damn tadpole.

**Gale:** Spot on.

---

**Player:** Until quite recently, nothing at all.

**Gale:** Ah, yes. The good old days.

---

**Player:** If you're about to start a lecture, I'm not interested.

**Gale:** Long story short then:

**Gale:** Thanks to the tadpole, we should have developed more than invasive symptoms by now, but we haven't.

*(Jumps to abnormal conclusion)*

---

**Player:** A githyanki's worst fate. *(Githyanki)*

**Gale:** Not the prettiest of transmutations, is it?

---

## The Seven Days of Ceremorphosis

**Gale:** Day one: fever and memory loss.

**Gale:** Day two: hallucinations and greying skin.

**Gale:** Day three: hair loss and blood leaking from all orifices.

**Gale:** Need I go on?

**Player:** *Nod.*

**Gale:** Day four: excruciating pain as the skeleton and organs reform and reposition.

**Gale:** Day five: the host's personality has disappeared. Fingers, toes and limbs elongate.

**Gale:** I take it you get the picture?

**Player:** I do, but you might as well finish the picture. *(Non-githyanki)*

**Gale:** Day six: the flesh around the mouth splits to make way for tentacles.

**Gale:** Day seven: a mind flayer is born.

**Gale:** This is the abridged version of course.

---

### Alternative: Githyanki knowledge

**Player:** I do, but I'd like to see if you get the rest right. *(Githyanki)*

**Gale:** Day six: the flesh around the mouth splits to make way for tentacles.

**Gale:** Day seven: a mind flayer is born.

**Gale:** A faultless if abridged version of the facts.

---

### Alternative: Player wants to end the lecture

**Player:** I've heard enough.

**Gale:** Can't say I blame you.

**Gale:** My point is this: our orifices remain blissfully unbloodied. Our heads remain clear, and our blood temperature normal.

---

### Alternative: Player guesses ahead

**Player:** We should be having a fever by now. Greying skin even.

**Gale:** Exactly.

**Gale:** Our orifices remain blissfully unbloodied. Our heads remain clear, and our blood temperature normal.

---

### Alternative: Draconic Sorcerer response

**Player:** Dragon blood is hardy stuff. I'm not surprised I'm immune. *(Draconic Sorcerer)*

**Gale:** Yes, but that doesn't quite explain little old me, now does it?

**Gale:** What is happening, or rather not happening to us, is entirely undocumented.

---

## The Abnormality

**Gale:** Any expert will agree: this is... abnormal.

**Player:** Long live the abnormal.

**Gale:** I'll toast to that.

**Gale:** The pragmatic in me, however, sees only the silence before the storm.

**Gale:** Something to sleep on. We should get some rest.

---

## Alternative responses to abnormality:

**Player:** Can you explain why the symptoms aren't showing?

**Gale:** That, alas, is where my knowledge fails me.

**Gale:** A rogue might call it luck; a priest might call it fate.

**Gale:** As for myself: I'm a pragmatic. I see the silence before the storm.

**Gale:** Something to sleep on. We should get some rest.

---

**Player:** And what makes you the expert?

**Gale:** Study.

**Gale:** But what is happening, or rather not happening to us, is entirely undocumented.

**Gale:** Uncharted territory. The silence before the storm.

**Gale:** Something to sleep on. We should get some rest.

---

**Player:** Agreed. This is not the version I learned by heart. *(Githyanki)*

**Gale:** What is happening, or rather not happening to us, is entirely undocumented.

**Gale:** Uncharted territory. The silence before the storm.

**Gale:** Something to sleep on. We should get some rest.
