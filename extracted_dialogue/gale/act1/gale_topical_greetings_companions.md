## Companion Recruitments

### Astarion Recruited

**Gale:** Another joins our merry band. We'll need to keep our wits sharp around him, I think.

---

### Lae'zel Recruited

**Gale:** A githyanki joining our company. Not a collaboration I'd have anticipated, but a welcome one nonetheless.

---

### Shadowheart Recruited

**Gale:** Beneath her forbidding countenance, I sense this cleric will prove quite the companion. A wise decision to let her join us.

---

### Wyll Recruited

**Gale:** I've known a few warlocks in my time. Talented, of course, though sometimes too eager to listen to the devils on their shoulders. Comes with the territory, unfortunately.

---

### Karlach Recruited (No Wyll)

**Gale:** An ally fresh from the Hells themselves. Our company grows stranger by the minute - and all the better for it.

---

### Karlach Recruited (Wyll Convinced)

**Gale:** A devil and devil hunter, standing shoulder to shoulder against a common enemy. Rather poetic, I think.

---

### Karlach and Wyll Confrontation Resolved

**Gale:** Thank goodness that's all dealt with. The odds are stacked high enough against us already. No need to turn on each other.

---

### Wyll Becomes a Devil

**Gale (to Wyll):** You look, erm... Well the main thing is, you're alive. Plenty to be grateful for, horns or no horns.

**Gale (about Wyll):** I can't help feeling Wyll got off lightly. The wrath of the hells is second only the wrath of the heavens. Having a devil in our camp will certainly make things interesting. Never a dull day, is there?

---

## Companion Conflicts

### Shadowheart and Lae'zel Settle Peacefully

**Gale:** I'll say one thing for our troupe - we're not short on drama. I'm glad Shadowheart and Lae'zel settled their differences peacefully. Eventually.

---

### Lae'zel Kills Shadowheart

**Gale:** Our githyanki companion thinks little of killing those who deny her. An admirable quality, so long as her desires align with our own.

---

## Companion Quest Moments

### Astarion - Raphael Reveals the Scars

**Gale:** Raphael revealed a cruel truth, but believe me when I say it is one you are more powerful for learning. My opinion on such matters would be an uninformed one, I'm afraid. But is there anything within my expertise you wished to discuss?

---

### Astarion - Learning About Cazador's Ritual

**Gale:** I can't imagine how Astarion must be feeling. The terms of your own condemnation carved into your skin... A monster's actions. And monsters do not deserve such power as that ritual promised. When the time comes, Astarion will have his revenge I'm sure. And it will be richly deserved. But not yet, so what can I do for you?

---

### Astarion - Spawn Siblings Reveal Ritual

**Gale:** Your siblings could use a dose of your cynicism. Anyone cruel enough to pursue such a means to power has no intention of sharing it. But you don't need me to tell you this. You're here about something else, I'll wager?

---

### Astarion - Stayed a Vampire Spawn

**Gale:** You possess great strength of will, to resist the lure of such powers as Cazador sought to wield. An admirable choice, if not one that will make achieving our purpose any easier.

---

### Astarion - Companion Stayed a Spawn

**Gale:** You did a good thing back there. I won't dwell on the matter - I know that's not a sentiment you're accustomed to revelling in, but rest assured - your actions have spoken for themselves.

---

### Karlach - Second Engine Upgrade

**Gale:** I know well the pain of seeing your life's hourglass running empty, grasping at any means of slowing the grains as they slip inexorably through your fingers. Your fate may be ordained, but your actions are not. Make each breath count, and what time you have with us will never be wasted.

**Gale (about Karlach):** I know well the pain of seeing your life's hourglass running empty, grasping at any means of slowing the grains as they slip inexorably through your fingers. Karlach's fate may be ordained, but her actions are not. She will make each breath count - we can be sure of that.

---

### Karlach - Infernal Rage

**Gale:** I've not seen infernal flames like that in quite some time. Why go to Avernus, when you can bring Avernus to us?
