# Gale's Magic Item Requests

*Throughout Act 1, Gale periodically asks for magic items to consume. This file contains the dialogue around giving or denying him these items.*

---

## When Offering to Give Gale a Magic Item

**Player:** *Give Gale a magic artefact.*

**Gale:** Thank you! *(grateful)*

*[Gale absorbs the magic from the item]*

---

## When Player Offers Multiple Items

*If you try to give Gale more than one item at a time:*

**Gale:** I might need you to be more specific there. Just one artefact will suffice. *or* I'm glad to see you're so well-stocked on suitable relics, but I only need one. *or* Please - just one artefact will be enough for now. *or* My condition requires a delicate touch. Just one item will suffice to keep it in check.

**Player:** Understood. I'll give you what you need.

*[Proceeds to trade interface]*

## When Gale Desperately Needs an Item

*If you've denied Gale items before, he becomes more urgent:*

**Gale:** Perhaps I'm not conveying the urgency of the situation. It's incredibly, world-shatteringly important you give me a suitable artefact. *Please.* *(urgent but remaining calm)*

**Player:** *Give Gale a suitable artefact.*

*[Proceeds to trade]*

---

## Asking What Will Happen to the Item

**Player:** What will happen to this item should I give it to you?

**Gale:** I will consume the magic inside. What was a powerful artefact will be rendered no more than a trinket. But it will save my life - even if only temporarily.

## Declining to Give Items (First Time)

**Player:** I can't spare anything at the moment. But you'll get what you need - just give me time. *or* I can't help just now. Bear with me, please.

*[Persuasion check - DC 10]*

**Success:**
**Gale:** Of course. I would hate for you to think me impatient, or ungrateful. I shall persevere, for now. *(gracious/patient)*

**Failure:**
**Gale:** I see. Let me remind you that this is not something that can be ignored forever. Artefacts are of little use if you don't live to enjoy them. *(peeved/impatient)*

---

## Declining Multiple Times

**Player:** The items you want are more use to me unconsumed. You can't have anything yet.

**Gale:** I see. Let me remind you that this is not something that can be ignored forever. Artefacts are of little use if you don't live to enjoy them. *(peeved/impatient)*

---

## Declining After Multiple Denials (Second Time)

**Player:** You must be patient, Gale. I *will* help, but I can't do it right now. *or* I'll give you the item you need when I'm ready, and not before. *or* I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do just now.

*[Persuasion check - DC 15]*

**Success:**
**Gale:** Very well. A little longer won't hurt... Actually, it might, but I shall try all the same. *(gracious/patient)*

**Failure:**
**Gale:** I sense you don't quite appreciate the urgency of the matter. Dawdling may cost us dearly. *(peeved/impatient)*

---

## Refusing Completely (Gale Leaves)

**Player:** I'm not giving you anything. Not now, not ever. *or* I can't do that. You'll simply have to go and find what you need yourself.

**Gale:** Well, there was an invitation to leave if I ever heard one. Good luck in your endeavours - you shall certainly need it. *(catty/leaving permanently)*

*or*

**Gale:** Most unhelpful. In that case, I shall have to seek my own salvation. Elsewhere. *(annoyed, in a huff - about to leave party)*

*[Gale leaves the party permanently]*
