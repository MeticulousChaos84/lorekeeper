**Gale:** Tiring business, isn't it? All this travelling and adventuring. Why don't we take a little break? Allow ourselves a few moments of rest. Gives me a chance to talk to you about something, well, rather important. *(Suddenly quite serious.)*

**Gale:** We've been on the road together for a while now, haven't we? Survived some perils, overcame some obstacles. Ever since you were kind enough to free me from that stone, I've seen you demonstrate remarkable guile and courage.

**Narrator:** *Gale recounts specific good deeds the player has performed - resolving conflicts peacefully, protecting the innocent, showing mercy.*

**Gale:** These deeds attest to a strong and noble character. They attest to prime leadership qualities as well. In short: I've grown to trust you.

**Gale:** The reason I make a point of saying this is that I've grown confident enough to tell you something I've yet to tell another living soul. Except for my cat.

**Gale:** You see, I have this... condition. Very different from the parasite we share, but just as deadly.

**Gale:** The specifics are rather personal, but suffice it to say that it is a malady I have learned to live with - though not without some effort.

**Gale:** No, no - nothing like that. Though if I fail to treat it then the consequences would not be contained to me alone.

**Gale:** No, it cannot be cured. And I assure you I've left no page unturned in reaching that conclusion. I can keep this condition under control, as indeed I've done for a significant amount of time, but that was under different circumstances altogether. Home, in Waterdeep.

**Gale:** What it comes down to is this: every so often I need to get my hands on a powerful magical item and absorb the Weave inside.

**Gale:** I can say no more on the matter - not now anyway. Just trust me when I say it's all of vital importance.

**Gale:** Staffs, tomes, cowls - the form doesn't matter, so long as it's brimming with Weave.

**Gale:** Trust me when I say - the loss of the occasional wizard's staff or tome of enchantment is a bargain given the cost of allowing me to deteriorate.

**Gale:** I'll spare you the finer details, but it begins with a simple biological deterioration. Muscle spasms, disorientation, a slight ringing in the ears. And if left for too long... Catastrophe. *(Matter of fact. With a levity you don't expect to hear the word spoken.)*

**Gale:** It's been days since I last consumed an artefact - since before we were abducted. It is time. And by that I mean it's *imperative* that I find and consume strands of Weave at the earliest possible juncture.

**Gale:** That is why I turn to you. I need you to help me find magic items to consume. It is vital. Dare I say it, critical.

**Gale:** As luck would have it, Faerûn is full of them, though I do feel obliged to point out that items of power tend to be in the hands of the powerful. There will be danger involved - or great cost.

**Gale:** Splendid. A bit of boldness will serve us well.

**Gale:** As luck would have it, you're already primed to give me exactly what I need... *(If player has suitable magic item)*

**Gale:** Thank you. I see my trust in you was not misplaced! I'm sure we won't have to look very far to find what I need: Faerûn overflows with magic-infused treasure.

**Gale:** I know the allure magic artefacts hold. I understand their value and their power. All this to say: I understand the sacrifice I ask of you. But if I may be so bold: it's for a very good cause indeed. I hope I can count on you.

## Alternative Path: Player Demands Explanation Before Agreeing
---

**Gale:** Valid question. If not out of the simple goodness of your heart, then perhaps your own self-interest might be sufficient motivation. Having a wizard like me around is quite the boon when facing the perils that stalk these lands. It will be far harder for me to assist you if I can barely stand upright.

**Gale:** I know that what I ask may seem unreasonable, but I promise I only make such a request because it is so *incredibly* important. Please - trust me. Your help could be the difference between life and death.

## Alternative Path: Player Questions Why Gale Can't Do This Alone
---

**Gale:** A fair point - however, until recently I was able to rely on a supply of artefacts stored in my tower in Waterdeep. A supply that has now run dry.

**Gale:** The reality of the matter is that a lone wizard with a chronic impairment such as my own is not in the most ideal of situations with regards to self-defence. The manner of artefacts I need are not often found waiting patiently on a shop-keep's shelf. One usually has to lift them delicately from trap-filled tombs or prise them from the hands of violent ne'erdowells.

## Alternative Path: Player Initially Refuses, Gale Persists
---

**Gale:** I understand that I'm asking for a lot, but I can't tell you everything. Not yet anyway. Please reconsider.

**Gale:** No. *(In response to "You aren't going to drop this, are you?")*

**Gale:** I don't know how else I can explain the imperative nature of this issue. You can't simply dismiss it. *(Getting annoyed/hint of disbelief that you're refusing him so adamantly)*

## Alternative Path: Player Uses Tadpole to Probe (Success)
---

**Narrator:** *You become one with Gale's mind and you can feel something sinister oppressing you.* *(Mind meld)*

**Narrator:** *It's... inside of you, a mighty darkness radiating from your chest.* *(Mind meld)*

**Narrator:** *You could try to push further, but your hold over Gale feels brittle. It won't be easy delving deeper without him noticing.* *(Mind meld)*

**Narrator:** *You see through Gale's eyes, staring down the corridors of a dread memory. A book, bound, then suddenly opened.* *(Mind meld)*

**Narrator:** *Inside there are no pages, only a swirling mass of blackest Weave that pounces.* *(Mind meld)*

**Narrator:** *It's teeth, it's claws, it's unstoppable as it digs through and becomes part of you. And gods, is it ever-hungry...* *(Mind meld)*

**Gale:** Keeping me in suspense, are you? Come on, tell me, do we have an agreement or not?

## Alternative Path: Player Admits Using Tadpole (Gale Discovers)
---

**Gale:** What?! *(Surprised and angry.)*

**Gale:** You used that thing against me? And you saw! After I told you... *(Angry)*

**Gale:** You had no right! None at all! I've a good mind to turn around and depart this little company of ours immediately. I'd rather be alone than spend another moment in the presence of someone inclined to such unjustified invasions of privacy.

**Gale:** The need remains debatable, but I recognise your responsibility. *(Still angry, but the player convinced him to stay, so slightly softer.)* Perhaps my reaction was a tad volatile, the irony of which is not lost on me. Though it needs remain so on you, for the time being.

**Gale:** I hope that the glimpse you caught on my condition convinced you of the urgency in treating it. Can I count on you to give me the artefacts I need?

---

## Alternative Path: Low Approval/Previously Refused
---

**Gale:** Spare me a moment, if you please. I've something important to discuss with you. *(A bit more sombre and serious here. In this intro he feels compelled to speak out of necessity, but he doesn't really want to.)*

**Gale:** We've been travelling together for a while now and I think it's safe to say we don't always see eye to eye. That said, necessity compels me to set aside my reservations. I have no choice but to speak.

**Gale:** You see, I have this... condition. Very different from the parasite we share, but just as deadly.

*(Conversation continues as above)*
