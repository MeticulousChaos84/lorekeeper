# Gale's First Magic Item Request: A Matter of Trust
**Location:** Camp or during travel
**Act:** 1
**Participants:** Player, Gale
**Triggers:** After gaining sufficient approval (20+) and before Gale has mentioned his need for magic items

---

**Gale:** Tiring business, isn't it? All this travelling and adventuring.

**Gale:** I was wondering if I could have a word? There's something rather important I'd like to discuss.

---

## Player responses to the opening:

**Player:** 'Rather important' no less? All right, go ahead.

---

**Player:** I assume this might have something to do with that mysterious protocol of yours? *(If Gale died previously)*

**Gale:** Putting two and two together I see.

---

**Player:** Whatever it is, do make it brief. [Gale -1]

**Gale:** As you wish.

---

**Player:** No rest for the likes of us, Gale.

**Gale:** What, no rest for the dashing? Pish posh.

---

## The Trust Speech

**Gale:** We've been on the road together for a while now, haven't we? Survived some perils, overcame some obstacles.

**Gale:** Ever since you were kind enough to free me from that stone, I've seen you demonstrate remarkable guile and courage.

**Gale:** The way you defused the tension between Zevlor and Aradin. *(If applicable)*

**Gale:** The way you got Kagha to release the girl. *(If applicable)*

**Gale:** The way you got that boy out of a harpy's clutches. *(If applicable)*

**Gale:** In short: I've grown to trust you.

---

### Player responses:

**Player:** That's very gratifying to hear. [Gale +1]

**Gale:** The reason I make a point of saying this is that I've grown confident enough to tell you something I've yet to tell another living soul. Except for my cat.

---

**Player:** Enough with the flattery. Where is this going? [Gale -1]

**Gale:** I was being quite sincere, I assure you.

**Gale:** The reason I make a point of saying this is that I've grown confident enough to tell you something I've yet to tell another living soul. Except for my cat.

---

**Player:** Can't say the feeling's exactly mutual.

**Gale:** Be that as it may, my trust is yours.

**Gale:** The reason I make a point of saying this is that I've grown confident enough to tell you something I've yet to tell another living soul. Except for my cat.

---

## The Condition

**Gale:** You see, I have this... condition. Very different from the parasite we share, but just as deadly.

**Player:** What kind of condition?

**Gale:** The specifics are rather personal, but suffice it to say that it is a malady I have learned to live with - though not without some effort.

---

### Alternative responses:

**Player:** Is it contagious?

**Gale:** No, no - nothing like that. Though if I fail to treat it then the consequences would not be contained to me alone.

---

**Player:** Can it be cured?

**Gale:** No, it cannot be cured. And I assure you I've left no page unturned in reaching that conclusion.

**Gale:** I can keep this condition under control, as indeed I've done for a significant amount of time, but that was under different circumstances altogether. Home, in Waterdeep.

---

## The Treatment: Consuming Magic

**Gale:** Out here I'm afforded no such luxury. I'm in need of powerful artefacts - items suffused with the Weave - that I can consume and repurpose for my own ends.

---

### Player questions:

**Player:** Your illness causes you to consume raw magic? I'm going to need the details...

**Gale:** I can say no more on the matter - not now anyway.

**Gale:** Just trust me when I say it's all of vital importance.

---

**Player:** What kind of items are we talking about exactly?

**Gale:** Staffs, tomes, cowls - the form doesn't matter, so long as it's brimming with Weave.

---

**Player:** Wouldn't that ruin the item?

**Gale:** Trust me when I say - the loss of the occasional wizard's staff or tome of enchantment is a bargain given the cost of allowing me to deteriorate.

---

**Player:** What happens if you don't consume these artefacts?

**Gale:** I'll spare you the finer details, but it begins with a simple biological deterioration. Muscle spasms, disorientation, a slight ringing in the ears. And if left for too long...

**Gale:** Catastrophe. *(Matter of fact. With a levity you don't expect to hear the word spoken.)*

---

**Player:** Are you telling me you're *addicted* to magic?

**Gale:** No - no, it's nothing like that. Magic isn't a narcotic to me, it's quite literally a life-saver.

**Gale:** I would not burden anyone other than myself with this were the stakes not so high, and the means of obtaining such artefacts challenging for a humble wizard to face alone.

---

**Player:** So you've been lying to me this whole time. Wonderful.

**Gale:** I am what I am - I never lied to you, I've merely been economical with the truth.

---

### Healing-related responses:

**Player:** I think I might have a dock leaf in my bag, or some medicinal berries... *(Ranger)*

**Player:** Nature provides the cure to most ailments. Tell me your symptoms, and I might prepare a poultice or potion. *(Druid)*

**Player:** I could pray on your behalf. My god may offer some guidance on how you might be cured. *(Cleric)*

**Gale:** Thank you for the offer, but the treatment for my condition is very specific.

---

## The Request

**Gale:** That is why I turn to you. I need you to help me find magic items to consume. It is vital. Dare I say it, critical.

---

### Player responses:

**Player:** Where do you suggest we find the artefacts you need?

**Gale:** Anywhere and everywhere. The druids might well have something of utility stowed away in this grove. The goblins may be monstrous creatures, but I bet they can point us in the direction of something valuable.

**Gale:** Treasure is as treasure does - and a magic trinket can be plucked from any manner of deadfalls, barrow-mounds, and forgotten cellars.

**Gale:** Trust me: when the time comes and you have a magic item you think you could live without, you'll know.

---

**Player:** I fail to see why you need me to help you with this. You've done fine without me so far.

**Gale:** A fair point - however, until recently I was able to rely on a supply of artefacts stored in my tower in Waterdeep. A supply that has now run dry.

**Gale:** The reality of the matter is that a lone wizard with a chronic impairment such as my own is not in the most ideal of situations with regards to self-defence.

**Gale:** I would not burden anyone other than myself with this were the stakes not so high, and the means of obtaining such artefacts challenging for a humble wizard to face alone.

---

**Player:** I'd be happy to help.

**Gale:** Thank you. I appreciate it.

*(Player agrees to help)*

---

**Player:** Sounds like no 'condition' I've ever heard of. I'd say you're just fishing for loot. [Gale -1]

**Gale:** Believe what you will, but when the time comes and the world starts collapsing around your ears, I imagine you'll reconsider your position.

---

**Player:** Honestly, that sounds terrible. I see no upside to this for me. [Gale -2]

**Gale:** Then I suggest you look closer.

**Gale:** If I may be so bold as to jog your memory, do you happen to recall the charred husk known as the Sword Coast? That's what awaits us if my condition remains untreated.

---

## Conclusion: Agreement to Help

**Gale:** It's a strange way of earning one's trust, I know. Concealing a truth and then slamming you in the face with it. But I hope you understand that I had no other option.

**Gale:** Now that you do know the truth, I hope you'll keep your eyes open for suitable items as we explore the area. I'm quite sure we'll find the necessary goods. That is, if you're still willing to help me.

**Player:** Very well. I'll help you manage this condition of yours.

**Gale:** Thank you. I appreciate it.

**Gale:** But I suspect it's best I say no more on the matter for the time being. I'll notify you when I need something.

---

## Alternative: Refusal

**Player:** No. I do not.

**Gale:** I am a fool. A fool to have trusted you. *(Angry)*

---

## Alternative: Demanding Explanation

**Player:** Let us agree on actions first and explanations later. Yes?

**Player:** Very well. I'll help you, though I expect an explanation eventually.

**Gale:** Thank you. I appreciate it.

**Gale:** But I suspect it's best I say no more on the matter for the time being. I'll notify you when I need something.

---

**Player:** Sorry - that's not going work for me. I need an explanation.

*(Conversation continues with Gale being forced to explain further or ending negatively depending on player's persistence)*
