## First Encounter: The Beard Complaint

**Tara the Tressym:** Ah! Oh, goodness. That thing on your face is even worse than I remember.

**Tara the Tressym:** Mr Dekarios, if you have to ask, there's no hope for you at all. Please tell me you've at least made inroads when it comes to finding someone to settle down with. Myself and Mrs Dekarios are starting to think you intend to die alone.

**Tara the Tressym:** Naturally. After you abandoned her, there was only me left to keep her company. She's very good company, though. Ah, the stories we've traded over toast and tea. You're a highly entertaining source of speculation. But speculation only goes so far! Tell me, Mr Dekarios - how have you been?

**Tara the Tressym:** Doing what, exactly? Last I checked, that orb is still pulsating inside you, vulgar as ever. Oh. Well. That is... hm. How long do you have? *DAYS?!* Mystra preserve us.

**Tara the Tressym:** Mr Dekarios. Gale. You are the finest mind - the finest wizard - I have ever had the pleasure to know. If anyone can beat this thing, *it is you*. When you tried to control the Weave - when it all went, pardon my language, belly up - I was terrified. Scared you'd be hurt. Scared Mystra would punish you for your transgression. But do you know what never crossed my mind? That you wouldn't figure a way out of it. My clever friend never leaves a knot knotted. This parasite is one more knot, so get to tugging threads. And - Mr Dekarios - please. The beard. I'd cut it down myself if I could hold a razor.

## Conversations About Waterdeep & His Mother

**Tara the Tressym:** What is it, Mr Dekarios? or All right, Mr Dekarios? or Well, if it isn't my favourite fellow himself.

**Tara the Tressym:** More or less the same - though news of some mad faction calling themselves 'Absolutists' is starting to trickle in. I told your mother not to worry. That if they were anything to worry about, Baldur's Gate would handle things quick-sharp. Keep them from spreading their tendrils north. She still wants to know when she'll see you again, sir. I avoid giving any answers. But she misses you.

**Tara the Tressym:** I'll tell her. With my catflap of displacement, I can afford the occasional visit. I'd bring you along, if I could. Perhaps some day.

**Tara the Tressym:** I know that, but she doesn't. She'd keel over if she knew just how you'd tried to manipulate the Weave. Or maybe she'd just say something like, 'My Gale always was one to make the impossible possible.' Oh, but she adores you.

**Tara the Tressym:** But then whatever will we talk about? Anyhow - I'm keeping my senses pricked for any sign of another item that might be of use to you. Hopefully something will turn up soon. You focus on that parasite. I daresay turning into a mind flayer may set that bomb off as quick as anything. No time to waste.

## Romance Revelation

**Tara the Tressym:** Rrriaow! AHEM! That is, you must tell me every detail, Mr Dekarios. About many things, actually. You left the tower in such a hurry, and you didn't leave an address.

---

## Scritches & Affection

*(Gale gives Tara a good scritch)*

**Tara the Tressym:** Oh yes, yes, yes - quite nice. or That's the spot, sir - thanking you. or Blessed Mystra, that's lovely.

---

## Ongoing Check-Ins

**Tara the Tressym:** A-slinking and a-stalking, of course. This is a fascinating area of the Realms - this cult of the Absolute is taking over like a bad rash. That parasite in your head seems to be quiet enough, thank the gods.

**Tara the Tressym:** Attaboy! Keep doing what you're doing, then. We'll have this whole business sorted in no time. I'll be sure to let your mother know you'll be home before she knows it - for a nice long visit.

**Tara the Tressym:** Away with you, then! I have no desire to bear witness to such a distasteful process. But if you've still a warm lap on you when all's said and done, we can still be friends. I suppose.

**Tara the Tressym:** Depends. Are mind flayers warm-blooded? If so, my prize napping spot on your lap won't be compromised. In which case, I suppose we could find an accord. And, of course, your mother would still think you a prince, no matter how many tentacles you had. And with a nautiloid, you may even manage to visit her more often.

## After Moonrise Towers: Return to Camp

**Tara the Tressym:** Mr Dekarios, sir! Why - you're back! I was... I was quite terrified you wouldn't return. What happened in there? You've got that quite the wrong way around, Mr Dekarios. She has lost *you*, and is a poorer goddess for it. So? What led to this decision?

**Tara the Tressym:** We *are* heading to Baldur's Gate, aren't we? You've always been very positive about the selection of books in Sorcerous Sundries. An opportunity for research, perhaps. You get all your best ideas from books, don't you, sir? Your worst ones, too... but it's worth the risk. For now, I'm terribly glad you're all right. If I'd lost you to a giant brain, the irony would have been intolerable.

**Tara the Tressym:** I won't ask for more details. All I know is we can lick this thing. Rough-tongued and ready. We're heading to Baldur's Gate, aren't we? You've always been very positive about the selection of books in Sorcerous Sundries. An opportunity for research, perhaps.

**Tara the Tressym:** That's quite all right, sir. Quiet company is more my specialty, anyway. How about a little love?

## Act 3: The Crown of Karsus

**Tara the Tressym:** There's a glint in your eye, Mr Dekarios. Explain. I imagine that's going to be somewhat difficult to retrieve. But you're quite fond of accomplishing difficult feats, aren't you? Like winning my unwavering affection, for instance. And oh, you did a very good job of that. Shoo then, Mr Dekarios. That crown isn't going to retrieve itself.

**Tara the Tressym:** I never thought I'd have to convince you to prioritise a trip to a bookshop. Go on, then. Out with you!

**Tara the Tressym:** Hup hup, sir! Go on and have a read - I'd very much like to know this saga had a happy ending for my favourite fellow. Get to it, hmm?

**Tara the Tressym:** I can't fathom why you're speaking in the past tense, sir. If you've lost the damn thing, I expect you to get busy finding it. It could be the key to your salvation. If I have to go search for it myself, I'm going to take it out on the legs of your leather chaise.

**Tara the Tressym:** Well! We are in Baldur's Gate, aren't we? You've always been very positive about the selection of books in Sorcerous Sundries. An opportunity for research, perhaps. Search carefully, sir. The good things are usually either behind glass, or buried under a stack of loathsome picture papers. And if you can't find what you're looking for in Sorcerous Sundries, I'll go check them all. But for now - get on with it!

## The Boyish Charm Exchange

**Tara the Tressym:** Boyish charm and knees that creak like rusted hinges! Quite the combination.

---

## Elminster's Second Visit (Wyrm's Crossing)

**Tara the Tressym:** I know that look. Come on - out with it. What's happened? Elminster? And what did he have to say for himself? I hope he apologised for that horrid message he brought the last time he graced us with his presence.

## Mystra's Command: The Confrontation

**Tara the Tressym:** You are <i>not</i> going to blow yourself up. Forgive me, Mr Dekarios. As endlessly charming as you are, you're not so charming that your death would have no consequences. I won't have it. You're important. You matter. Not just to me and your mother and all the people you know and cherish. But to people who haven't even met you yet. Countless might-have-beens that live in the future and whose existence depends on your choices - they matter too. So I will ask you again: do you promise me you won't blow yourself up?

**Tara the Tressym:** I didn't say 'try'. I said 'promise'! Ghastly boy. But fine. I'll take what I'm given and be grateful for it. Now go on. We don't want to make a scene, do we? There's a good lad.

**Tara the Tressym:** Thank heavens! I thought I was going to have to claw some sense into you. You are too precious to meet your end splattered all over an illithid monstrosity. No no. I won't allow it. I'm glad you aren't considering such a ridiculous proposition. You've a good head on your shoulders, Mr Dekarios. No matter what anyone says.

**Tara the Tressym:** Mystra is a god, Gale. We pay her her due, but not with our lives. Your duty isn't to Mystra. Your duty is to return to Waterdeep. To continue your research, to live your *life*! She really wants to kill you, Gale? To squander your life? Is that really a god you want to serve? Gods! At this rate I'll have to give up the Weave and take up a crossbow. Get the gods out of our business entirely.

**Tara the Tressym:** Consider this, Gale Dekarios: I forbid you to undertake this fool's errand. It isn't your job to do the gods' dirty work for them. If Mystra wants to intervene, let her do so at her own peril.

## If Gale Commits to the Detonation

**Tara the Tressym:** Damn the Absolute. Damn Mystra. Damn it all, if you go through with this, Gale. Go! I don't want to look at you anymore! Go on!

**Tara the Tressym:** What's that? For a moment I thought my friend Mr Dekarios was near, but now I see it's only the ghost of one of Mystra's playthings.

**Tara the Tressym:** This disobedience of yours had best continue once you find this Heart of the Absolute, Gale. That's all I have to say to you.

## Other Dialogue Variations

**Tara the Tressym:** You <i>are</i> my pet. And I'm yours. A perfect circle of companionship. I don't know about you, but I wouldn't have it any other way.

**Tara the Tressym:** I'm not one to pry. I'd rather make up all the juicy details myself over tea with your mother.

**Tara the Tressym:** You've a Netherese orb in your belly, a tadpole in your head, and you've been sleeping in what amounts to a very well-appointed ditch. So go on - explain yourself. Don't be silly. What is it really?

**Tara the Tressym:** Hello, sir.

**Tara the Tressym:** Well, sir? How goes the search?

**Tara the Tressym:** Chin up and keep at it, sir. And don't forget to pet your favourite tressym for good luck.

**Tara the Tressym:** Unless you've got Mr Dek- erm, *Gale* in your pocket, I don't believe we have terribly much to say to one another. *(If player is not Gale)*

**Notes:**
- Tara visits camp periodically throughout Acts 1-3
- She can be spoken to for check-ins, affection (scritches), and updates on the quest
- Her dialogue varies based on story progression (tadpole revelation, Moonrise events, Act 3 Crown quest, Mystra's command)
- The most emotionally significant conversation revolves around Mystra's command for Gale to detonate himself
- Tara serves as Gale's emotional anchor and voice of reason, advocating for his life and autonomy against divine commands
