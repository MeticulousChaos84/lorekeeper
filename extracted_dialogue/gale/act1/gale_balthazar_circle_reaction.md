# Gale: Balthazar's Circle Reaction

*Gale reacts to the player successfully using or failing with Balthazar's necromantic circle in the Mind Flayer Colony.*

---

## Player Successfully Used the Circle (Sorcerer/Warlock/Wizard)

**Gale:** A fine job you did back there. Not *exactly* how I would have approached it, but we all have our quirks when it comes to using magic. Some more than others. *(trying to feel happy for the player - they did something Gale wanted to do himself, and succeeded at it)*

**Gale:** Now, given my magical expertise is of limited use to you, was there something else you wanted to ask me about? *(hint of sass, but not too stroppy)*

## Player Successfully Used the Circle (Mystra Cleric)

**Gale:** You served your goddess well. Not as well as *I* might have, but the end cares not for the means, and the work was done. *(trying to feel happy for the player - they did something Gale wanted to do himself, and succeeded at it)*

**Gale:** Now, given my magical expertise is of limited use to you, was there something else you wanted to ask me about? *(hint of sass, but not too stroppy)*

## Player Successfully Used the Circle (General)

**Gale:** There's the makings of a fine follower of Mystra within you, give or take a few decades of studying the Weave. *(trying to feel happy for the player - they did something Gale wanted to do himself, and succeeded at it)*

**Gale:** Now, given my magical expertise is of limited use to you, was there something else you wanted to ask me about? *(hint of sass, but not too stroppy)*

## Player Crafted Dark Lantern (Alternative Success)

**Gale:** If you'd prefer to rely on beginner's luck than my myriad experiences in studying such magics, who am I to judge? *(trying to feel happy for the player - they did something Gale wanted to do himself, and succeeded at it)*

**Gale:** Now, given my magical expertise is of limited use to you, was there something else you wanted to ask me about? *(hint of sass, but not too stroppy)*

## Circle Exploded on the Player

**Gale:** Nothing like a good singeing to teach us the perils of dabbling with magic we don't understand. And the wisdom of stepping aside for those who do.

**Gale:** So - assuming you're more willing to take my words to heart from now on - what can I do for you?
