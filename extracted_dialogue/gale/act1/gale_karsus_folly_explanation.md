# Gale: The Tale of Karsus and Karsus' Folly

## Context
When asked about Karsus, Gale recounts the catastrophic moment in Faerûnian history known as Karsus' Folly - the fall of Netheril and the death of Mystryl. This story has profound relevance to Gale's own situation with the Netherese orb.

## Karsus was perhaps the most powerful wizard that ever lived. The-child-who-would-be-a-god, the elves called him.

And he tried. With a spell of his own devising he endeavoured to usurp in one fell swoop the power of the goddess of magic. Mystryl, she was called then. Imagine what it must have felt like. To be a god. To know yourself to be untouchable. To be mistaken.

As Karsus aimed his spell at her, she began to unravel, and with her, the entire Weave. Too late did he realise what he had unleashed. It would have been the end of everything had not Mystryl sacrificed herself. The goddess of magic *is* all magic. By dying, the entire Weave was lost, and the spell that challenged a god failed.

It was the end of Mystryl, the end of Karsus, and the end of an entire civilisation. As the-child-who-would-be-a-god was turned to stone, his empire came crashing down around him. The floating cities of Netheril were no more. An event that came to be known as Karsus' Folly.

## On the Weave's Restoration

Mystryl was reborn as Mystra. Upon her return, the Weave returned with her.

Now, so many centuries later, I tried to follow in the footsteps of Karsus, not to destroy Mystra, but to prove my love for her. I tried to control only a fraction of the magic that was unleashed that fateful day. I merely sought to return one tiny diamond to an imperfect crown.

Gale's Folly one might call it. History. Repetition. It's the way things go.
