# Gale: Condition Deteriorating - Leaving the Party

**Context:** If the player has not provided Gale with magical items to stabilize his condition, his orb eventually deteriorates beyond his capacity to manage. He must leave the party to protect them from the explosion. This is a failure state that occurs after Act 2 if Gale never received magic items.

## Forced Departure

**Gale:** I'm afraid this is where we part ways - my condition's deteriorated beyond even my capacity to salvage.

It would be selfish of me to stay, when in doing so I'd be putting you, and everyone else within spitting distance in catastrophic peril.

---

### Please Don't Leave Me, Gale. I Love You.

*[If partnered with Gale]*

**Gale:** It's too late for that, I'm afraid. My condition has shifted somehow - its hunger for the Weave can no longer be satisfied.

Oh, I wouldn't say that. Just a man who's been living with the consequences of his actions for a tad too long.

If you recall nothing else of my time with you, let it be this: you were *most* special to me. And it will be your face I picture, when the end comes.

### You Can't Leave. We've Only Just Begun To Grow Closer...

*[If dating Gale]*

**Gale:** It's too late for that, I'm afraid. My condition has shifted somehow - its hunger for the Weave can no longer be satisfied.

Oh, I wouldn't say that. Just a man who's been living with the consequences of his actions for a tad too long.

### A Noble Decision. You're A Good Man, Gale.

**Gale:** Oh, I wouldn't say that. Just a man who's been living with the consequences of his actions for a tad too long.

A shame. This is a journey I'd have liked to see through to the end, but I've my own finale to face. And it's best I face it alone.

### Wait. I Can Still Give You The Artefacts You Need.

**Gale:** It's too late for that, I'm afraid. My condition has shifted somehow - its hunger for the Weave can no longer be satisfied.

### Make Sure You're Nice And Far Away Before You Keel Over, Won't You?

**Gale:** Don't tempt me.

## Magic Item Reminders (Before Deterioration)

**Context:** These conversations occur when Gale's condition is worsening but not yet critical, as reminders that he needs magical items.

---

### High Approval Reminder

*[In Shadow Cursed Lands, high approval]*

**Gale:** Whatever lurks in the darkness ahead, I can hardly face it in my present condition. I need my full strength to stand against such shadows.

We've already found enough magic to soothe its disquiet, if you'll just give me what I need.

---

### Low Approval / Not Dating Reminder

*[In Shadow Cursed Lands, lower approval or not dating]*

**Gale:** I cannot keep throwing myself headlong into such danger while I am so unstable. If it my condition is not treated soon, I will be compelled to leave.

---

### General Reminder

**Gale:** I trust you'll treat the matter with the appropriate exigency. The moment we find a suitable item, please - give it to me.

---

## First Magic Item Request (Urgent)

*[When Gale's first item request becomes critical]*

**Gale:** Ah, I'm glad you've a moment for me.

My predicament has become rather urgent. I need a magical artefact to consume, right now.

Whatever lurks in the darkness ahead, I can hardly face it in my present condition. I need my full strength to stand against such shadows.
