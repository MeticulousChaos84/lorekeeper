## Dialogue

**Gale:** That scamp reminds me of myself when I was a nipper. Always getting into trouble.

*Gale reflects on his mischievous past:*

**Gale:** One time my parents denied me a kitten, so I summoned myself a tressym. Dear old Tara. Beautiful creature. Benefits of a wizard's education, you see. Of course my considerable talent didn't hurt either.

**Gale:** Well... That depends on who you ask, I suppose. I may have summoned things rather more exotic than a winged cat.

*On the topic of his childhood summoning mishaps:*

**Gale:** There was that magma mephit once. Nice fellow - we kept in touch.

*Or, if the party has encountered K'ha'ssji'trach'ash:*

**Gale:** There was that magma mephit once. K'ha'ssji'trach'ash, in fact. You met him.

**Gale:** Of course, in walked the housekeeper. Screaming, yelling, panic, and before you knew it: fire everywhere.

**Gale:** Anyway, I'm glad we got that boy out of his predicament. Poor lad would have been harpy feed if it wasn't for you.

## Alternative: Sorcerer Player Dialogue

*If the player is a Sorcerer:*

**Player:** The idea of a magic education is bizarre to me. I had to learn or die.

**Gale:** Whether the source is blood or books, magic is hard to master. Do or die indeed.

*If the player is a Sorcerer who boasts about preparation:*

**Player:** Bet that took hours of preparation. I can do it without thinking.

**Gale:** And I can pass water without thinking, but that hardly makes it magic.

## Alternative: Wild Magic Sorcerer Player Dialogue

*If the player is a Wild Magic Sorcerer:*

**Player:** At least when you summoned a winged cat, that's what actually appeared...

**Gale:** Ha! Go on...

*The player can share their own wild magic mishaps:*

**Player:** I accidentally summoned an infant aboleth. It was... not friendly.

**Gale:** Well, well, quite the scamp yourself, aren't you? Luckily they're more fins than fangs at that age.

*Or:*

**Player:** I turned blue with orange stripes. Took a tenday to change back.

**Gale:** At least you were never in want of pyjamas.

*Or:*

**Player:** A cow dropped out of the sky. Her name was Stephanie.

**Gale:** So you made a cow drop out of the sky, which presumably killed it, and yet somehow you found out her name was Stephanie... I think I'll need a drink with the rest of that story.
