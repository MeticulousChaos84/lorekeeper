## High Approval: Trusting in Gale

*Narrator: The bond you share with Gale is remarkable, considering the short time you've known each other. Risk honesty, and you're almost certain he'll accept you as you are.*

**Gale:** I knew you had some dark secret to hide, but a vampire spawn? It wouldn't have been my first guess, I'll put it that way. But what does this revelation of yours mean for us going forward?

## Medium Approval: Simple Declaration

**Gale:** A vampire spawn? I'd hazard that's an attribute you're well justified in keeping to yourself. I'm glad you felt you could trust me with it. My neck's puncture-free, I've not experienced any overwhelming desire to exsanguinate my nearest and dearest... I can only conclude there's no harm done. But what does this revelation of yours mean for us going forward?

### If Astarion Claims Nothing Has Changed

**Gale:** Now with added bite. For now, let's consider that particular matter settled. Was that the only thing on your mind?

### If Astarion Mentions the Tadpole's Role

**Gale:** Is that so? Well let's hope that continues to be the case. There's no guarantee our cure will be found lurking in the darkness, after all. For now, let's consider that particular matter settled. Was that the only thing on your mind?

### If Astarion Mentions His Master

**Gale:** And if he does, he'll not find you alone. For now, let's consider that particular matter settled. Was that the only thing on your mind?

## Notes

- This dialogue requires positive approval with Gale; low approval paths result in significantly colder responses
- Gale's response to the Master warning ("he'll not find you alone") shows his willingness to stand by Astarion against Cazador
- The "now with added bite" quip demonstrates Gale's characteristic dry humor about the situation
- Unlike the confrontation scenarios, Gale here appreciates Astarion's initiative in being honest
