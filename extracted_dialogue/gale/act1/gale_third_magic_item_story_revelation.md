# Third Magic Item Story Revelation

*After Gale consumes the third magic item, he realizes it's not enough and decides he must reveal the truth about himself to the party.*

---

**Gale:** Good gods. *(relief)*

**Gale:** I don't know what to make of this. Three artefacts is a positive glut of magic, yet my hunger only grows. It hardly has any effect. Mystra have mercy on us all.

**Gale:** Listen, I need to speak to you, to all of you. It would be unconscionable of me to remain silent.

**Player:** Go on. You're among friends. *or* There's no need. I trust you, Gale.

**Gale:** I might just be about to remedy that. *or* I appreciate it greatly, but I can no longer keep you in the dark.

**Gale:** You have to know who I was. You have to know who I really am.

**Gale:** What I am is a walking shadow of the promise I once held.

**Gale:** I'm what one might call a wizard prodigy, who from an early age could not only control the Weave, but compose it, much like a musician or a poet.

*[This leads into Gale's full backstory revelation, which continues in a nested dialogue - the complete story of Mystra, the orb, and his fall from grace]*

## Alternative: Player Challenges Gale

**Player:** This better be good. We wasted a small fortune on you already.

**Gale:** And a waste it might have been.

*[Continues to same backstory revelation]*

## Follow-Up Question

*After the third magic item has been consumed, you can ask Gale to continue the story:*

**Player:** You were going to tell me about your past - who you are.

**Gale:** What I am is a walking shadow of the promise I once held...
