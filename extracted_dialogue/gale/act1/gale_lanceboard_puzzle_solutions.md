## Puzzle Solution 1

**Gale:** The white queen moves up and right, diagonally, two squares, so that she threatens the black king and is covered by her white knight. The king can only respond by capturing the knight, but in doing so gets trapped by his own pawn and bishop, so the queen can checkmate by moving one more square up and to the right.

## Puzzle Solution 2

**Gale:** Queen to H8 - that's the upper right corner - then to D8, four squares left. The king can only withdraw to one square after the first move, and after the second has nowhere to retreat.

## Puzzle Solution 3

**Gale:** Let's see... the white queen moves all the way across and captures the black pawn. The black king is in check, so he has to retreat a square left. Then, the queen takes the other pawn, one square up and left, while moving in the protection of the bishop.

## Puzzle Solution 4

**Gale:** You threaten the black king with your rook by moving it one square right. That gives black two choices: The black bishop can take the white rook, in which case your queen is free to move three squares to the right, and checkmate the king under cover of your knight... or, the king can retreat up and right, but then your knight can move two squares left and one up to mate the king while the rook covers all escapes.
