## The Thrill of Combat

*[If dating Gale, not partnered, and fought undead in SCL]*

**Gale:** It's quite thrilling, to fight off such grim creatures as this region throws at us. Especially being at your side.

I once read a book that explained in some detail the effect a brush with danger has on one's desire for... other forms of stimulation.

Have you ever read anything on that subject?

---

### What Are You Saying Exactly?

**Gale:** Only that I find you quite irresistible. Even illuminated by such rotten light as this place produces.

Perhaps it's just the thrill of our near-undead experience talking. But standing at your side through such darkness and disrepair, it only makes me want you more.

Unfortunately this is neither the time nor place to indulge such feelings. So, we must be patient and push all such thoughts aside. For now.

### Read It? I Could Have *Written* The Thing

**Gale:** I believe you. You never look so beautiful as at the end of a stirring battle, your cheeks flushed, gaze bright, muscles glistening...

Perhaps it's just the thrill of our near-undead experience talking. But standing at your side through such darkness and disrepair, it only makes me want you more.

Unfortunately this is neither the time nor place to indulge such feelings. So, we must be patient and push all such thoughts aside. For now.

### You're Drawn To Me, Even In A Place Like This?

**Gale:** I can't imagine anywhere that could turn my heart from you, cursed or otherwise. You'd always be as beautiful, and as impressive.

Perhaps it's just the thrill of our near-undead experience talking. But standing at your side through such darkness and disrepair, it only makes me want you more.

Unfortunately this is neither the time nor place to indulge such feelings. So, we must be patient and push all such thoughts aside. For now.

### I'm Not Much Of A Reader, But I've Seen Some Very Informative Diagrams...

**Gale:** You have? Then I might suggest we pool our knowledge. No sense in letting valuable first-hand experience go to waste, after all.

### Actually, There's A More Interesting Subject I Want To Discuss

**Gale:** Of course. Such distractions are hardly the most important thing to discuss at present.

## "Be My God" Rejection Follow-up

*[If partnered with Gale and rejected his proposal to seize the Crown]*

**Gale:** My love. I hope you enjoyed our voyage through the cosmos? I was hoping you might have a moment to talk about it...

---

### You Showed Me Eternity. I Haven't Stopped Thinking About It.

**Gale:** Neither have I - the closest thing to a deserving canvas on which to place your beauty. But I've also not forgotten why I took you there.

I hope you don't think less of me. Great ambition should not come at the expense of what you already hold dear. I see that now.

---

#### You Listened To Me. You Understood My Concerns. How Could I Think Less Of You?

**Gale:** What divine calculus plucked each of us from the ether, and thrust us together?

I don't deserve you, truly. But I will do my utmost to earn the right.

---

#### Good. Because I Won't Follow Blind Ambition. It Leads Nowhere.

**Gale:** I suppose I invited that caution I hear in your voice. And I will do my best to ease any lingering misgivings.

The highest ambition I harbour now is to see you smile, always.

---

#### I've No Wish To Stifle Your Dreams. But Pursuing The Crown Is A Nightmare Waiting To Happen.

**Gale:** True. Perhaps my notions leaned too optimistic. I would not wish Karsus' past to become my future. Not while I have you.

---

### Are You Questioning My Feelings, Or Your Own?

**Gale:** You know me too well. I'm second-guessing things, as usual.

That's the trouble with being quite clever - you always have to be *right*. Probe all avenues, consider all possibilities.

When I indulge impulsivity... as you know, the results can be quite catastrophic. But any path we walk together is the right one. I'm sure of that.

---

### Don't Tell Me... You're Having Regrets.

**Gale:** No, no. I've never been more sure of anything.

I hope you don't think less of me. Great ambition should not come at the expense of what you already hold dear. I see that now.

---

### Perhaps... Perhaps I Was Caught Up In The Moment.

**Gale:** I see. Then we should rest the topic for now, then. Perhaps the dream will yet prove true... or I will have to wake and face reality.

Thank you, for your candour, and your company. That night was still... very special for me.
