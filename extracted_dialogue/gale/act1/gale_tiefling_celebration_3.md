# Tara and Connections: Tiefling Celebration Conversation

**Location:** Camp - Tiefling Celebration Party
**Act:** 1
**Participants:** Gale, Player
**Triggers:** After defending the grove and celebrating with the tieflings; evening conversation with Gale at the party; requires decent approval; not yet dating Gale
**Synopsis:** After the party, Gale reflects on the night sky and shares memories of his tressym companion Tara, revealing how she saved his life during his year of isolation. This conversation can lead to the beginning of romance.

---

**Gale:** A beautiful night, don't you think? Nothing like a brush with destruction to make one appreciate the majesty of the celestial canvas. *(Wistful, missing an old friend.)*

**Gale:** It's a view I would once have shared with my companion. Though definitely unaccompanied by such revelry. *(Wistful, missing an old friend.)*

**Gale:** She preferred it when we were alone, curled up before a crackling hearth with some ancient, esoteric tome between us, ink glinting in the firelight... *(Recalling a rich, warming memory.)*

**Gale:** Not everyone is comfortable being alone with their thoughts. Though I never felt alone with a book in my hand. Or with her for company. *(Being generous towards the player's lack of interest, then returning to his reflective mood.)*

**Gale:** By Ahghairon's lost nose - no! *(Shocked at the player's suggestion. Note: this is a statue in Waterdeep's religious burial district.)*

**Gale:** Tara is not any cat. She's a *tressym*. And given your confusion, I'm guessing you've never met one. They're brilliant creatures - fine company for any self-respecting wizard.

**Gale:** I speak of Tara, my tressym, assistant, my constant companion through all the ills and tribulations my hubris has thrust upon me.

**Gale:** She'd be most impressed by our efforts saving these tieflings. Proud, even. And I've given her little to be proud of recently.

**Gale:** After I was afflicted with my condition, I locked myself in my tower for an entire year. I was inconsolable, wallowing in my self-inflicted tragedy.

**Gale:** I'd given up on myself, but Tara never did. It was her encouragement, her research that led me to my treatment. Once we knew that magically-infused items were the key, she went out to find them for me. She saved my life.

**Gale:** After so long being cared for by someone else, it feels good to have repaid the favour. Not directly to Tara, but to these poor tieflings. I'm sure she would approve.

**Gale:** 'Smart' does her a disservice. She's a fine wizard in her own right, though somewhat held back by her lack of opposable thumbs.

**Gale:** You remind me of her somewhat. There's a steeliness to you, an unwavering tenacity even in the face of, to be frank, quite dire odds.

**Gale:** I wish she were here for me to make a formal introduction, but I would never ask her to undertake such a journey. She is safer at home.

**Gale:** Besides, she was always telling me I needed to spread my wings, so to speak. Find mortal friends, instead of hanging onto Mystra's coattails. So that's what I'm doing. I hope.

## Variation: "Bad Luck on That Front" (Playful Deflection)

---

**Gale:** Very funny. But as we all know, nymphs are sticklers when it comes to their bathing routines. You, my friend, haven't been near a fresh spring in a tenday or more. *(Good humoured ribbing.)*

**Gale:** Not that I don't appreciate your musk. I actually rather like it... *(Getting carried away, accidentally revealed he's kind of interested in the player romantically.)*

**Gale:** Well, this seems as good a time as any for me to stop babbling on. *(Being awkward.)*

---

## Variation: "So I Remind You of Your Pet?"

---

**Gale:** I assure you, were you to meet Tara you would see the comparison for the flattery it is. But perhaps that's not a point worth labouring further.

**Gale:** Suffice it to say, I think rather a lot of you. And there aren't many on this plane who I'd give such high praise.

---

### Path 1: "Don't Stop There"

---

**Gale:** Were I to recite that list, I fear we'd still be here at dusk tomorrow. Many things, I assure you, but a conversation better saved for another time. *(Cheerfully deflecting your question, though it's clear he would have more to say.)*

---

### Path 2: "I'm Flattered"

---

**Gale:** One doesn't become the most powerful archmage in Waterdeep *and* lover to the goddess of magic herself by having low standards.

**Gale:** I assure you, when I tell someone they're wonderful - I mean it. And you are wonderful. *(Sincere, giving way the depth of his growing feelings fro the player.)*

---

### Path 3: "Being Mentioned in the Same Breath as Your Pet..."

---

**Gale:** Then let me say it more plainly -

**Gale:** I think you're rather wonderful. And that's not a word I waste on anyone unworthy of it.

---

## Romance Path: "Don't Stop Now" / "We'd Be Wonderful Together"

---

**Gale:** Were I to recite that list, I fear we'd still be here at dusk tomorrow. Many things, I assure you, but a conversation better saved for another time. *(Cheerfully deflecting your question, though it's clear he would have more to say.)*

or

**Gale:** Wait. Are you saying... *(Realising that the player was flirting, getting flustered.)*

**Gale:** I see. Then perhaps we see each other in the same light after all. A resplendent one, flush with warmth and anticipation, but one which I must shy away from, for now. *(Still flustered, but pleased to learn you like him romantically. Then getting to the point - he can't do anything until the orb is dealt with.)*

**Gale:** With my condition as volatile as it is, I fear any undue, er, excitement, may tip it over the edge. So to speak.

**Gale:** Go - enjoy your evening. Nothing better for the heart than a good night's rest, and mine is gladdened to know I'll have the pleasure of your company again come morning.

---

## Friendship Path

---

**Gale:** Wine is to wit as meat is to... to... oh, I can't bloody remember it. There I go, then, proving your point. *(Trying to sound impressive, a bit flustered.)*

**Gale:** Perhaps we'd better leave it at that. My ineloquent tongue isn't worthy of your ear at present. *(Cheerfully accepting the brush off, not taking it personally.)*

**Gale:** With my condition as volatile as it is, I fear any undue, er, excitement, may tip it over the edge. So to speak.

**Gale:** Go - enjoy your evening. Nothing better for the heart than a good night's rest, and mine is gladdened to know I'll have the pleasure of your company again come morning.

or

**Gale:** Go, indulge in the frivolities - they're good for the heart. And mine will be all the lighter, to see you enjoying yourself.

---

## Alternative: Asking About Tara's Belly Rubs (Romance Trigger)

---

**Gale:** She'll love you. So long as you don't rub her belly. She *hates* it when anyone does that.

**Gale:** The pleasures I experienced in Mystra's embrace go far beyond the thrill of having one's tummy tickled. I remember once, she took the smallest piece of the Weave and made it into - *(Taking the question seriously, missing the flirtatious side of it.)*

**Gale:** Wait. Are you saying... *(Realising that the player was flirting, getting flustered.)*

**Gale:** I see. Then perhaps we see each other in the same light after all. A resplendent one, flush with warmth and anticipation, but one which I must shy away from, for now. *(Still flustered, but pleased to learn you like him romantically. Then getting to the point - he can't do anything until the orb is dealt with.)*

**Gale:** With my condition as volatile as it is, I fear any undue, er, excitement, may tip it over the edge. So to speak.

**Gale:** Go - enjoy your evening. Nothing better for the heart than a good night's rest, and mine is gladdened to know I'll have the pleasure of your company again come morning.

or

**Gale:** You know what, I think I've clearly had far too much wine. And you've had nowhere near enough. I think this is a conversation best held back on - for now. *(Flustered, hesitating to explicitly say what he thinks you were offering, then backtracking altogether.)*

**Gale:** With my condition as volatile as it is, I fear any undue, er, excitement, may tip it over the edge. So to speak.

**Gale:** Go - enjoy your evening. Nothing better for the heart than a good night's rest, and mine is gladdened to know I'll have the pleasure of your company again come morning.

---

## Alternative: Asking About Loneliness

---

**Gale:** Sadly not. If I'm being entirely honest, my social circle is rather small. More of a dot. Or a pinhead.

**Gale:** I've got aquaintances, certainly. Plenty of colleagues. But friends? Those are precious indeed.

**Gale:** I hope, though we've only known each other for a short time, I might be able to count you among that number?

---

### Romance Branch: "I Hoped We Might Be More Than Friends"

---

**Gale:** Wait. Are you saying... *(Realising that the player was flirting, getting flustered.)*

**Gale:** I see. Then perhaps we see each other in the same light after all. A resplendent one, flush with warmth and anticipation, but one which I must shy away from, for now. *(Still flustered, but pleased to learn you like him romantically. Then getting to the point - he can't do anything until the orb is dealt with.)*

**Gale:** With my condition as volatile as it is, I fear any undue, er, excitement, may tip it over the edge. So to speak.

**Gale:** Go - enjoy your evening. Nothing better for the heart than a good night's rest, and mine is gladdened to know I'll have the pleasure of your company again come morning.

---

### Romance Branch: "That Depends. What Do You Like About Me?"

---

**Gale:** Were I to recite that list, I fear we'd still be here at dusk tomorrow. Many things, I assure you, but a conversation better saved for another time. *(Cheerfully deflecting your question, though it's clear he would have more to say.)*

**Gale:** With my condition as volatile as it is, I fear any undue, er, excitement, may tip it over the edge. So to speak.

**Gale:** Go - enjoy your evening. Nothing better for the heart than a good night's rest, and mine is gladdened to know I'll have the pleasure of your company again come morning.

---

## Alternative: Isolation and Social Struggles

---

**Gale:** Sometimes. But I imposed it upon myself, after all. I set up enough wards to keep an army at bay, never mind the few colleagues who sought to inquire about my welfare.

**Gale:** Tara did her best to keep my spirits up, of course, but there's only so much one tressym can make up for one's entire social circle. And she was often gone seeking items to treat my condition.

**Gale:** You're the first person I've spent any significant time with in a year or more. Spending time in your company, I realise that I may have left behind the greater part of my wit, and sensitivity, in my tower.

**Gale:** I'm glad. To know you enjoy my company is, well, it's rather wonderful actually. I'd be loathe to waste the time of someone who's become rather important to me.

**Gale:** I think you're rather wonderful. And that's not a word I waste on anyone unworthy of it.

---

### Romance Branch: "I Rather Like the Gale Stood in Front of Me"

---

**Gale:** Wait. Are you saying... *(Realising that the player was flirting, getting flustered.)*

**Gale:** I see. Then perhaps we see each other in the same light after all. A resplendent one, flush with warmth and anticipation, but one which I must shy away from, for now. *(Still flustered, but pleased to learn you like him romantically. Then getting to the point - he can't do anything until the orb is dealt with.)*

**Gale:** With my condition as volatile as it is, I fear any undue, er, excitement, may tip it over the edge. So to speak.

**Gale:** Go - enjoy your evening. Nothing better for the heart than a good night's rest, and mine is gladdened to know I'll have the pleasure of your company again come morning.

## Alternative Opening: Non-Celebration Version

---

**Gale:** Even in such fraught times as these, there is peace to be found in the stillness as evening draws in. *(Wistful, missing an old friend.)*

**Gale:** I used to while away many hours just like these with my companion, though in far comfier surrounds. *(Wistful, missing an old friend.)*

*(Continues as main conversation from "She preferred it when we were alone...")*
