## Dialogue

**Gale:** Believe it or not, but I witnessed a similar standoff back at the Yawning Portal. Of course, an establishment like that invites all sorts of outlandish entertainments.

*On what the Yawning Portal is:*

**Gale:** An inn in Waterdeep. Never a dull moment there. Adventurers come from all over Faerun to try their luck down the well: Leads into the Undermountain, you see - full of death, danger, and vast amounts of treasure. Hard to resist.

*On what the standoff was about:*

**Gale:** Oh, a drow, a dragonborn, and a cleric of Cyric walk into a bar. Your standard fare. Maybe someone was cheating at cards, maybe it was some weird lovers' quarrel. In any case, out came the crossbow, and a hush fell over the entire room.

*Continuing the story:*

**Gale:** I stood up and yelled: 'Shadowdark ale for everyone!' The crowd cheered, the tension drained into five dozen tankards, and soon all was well again. In a place like the Yawning Portal, the most powerful magic is calling for a round of drinks.

*If the player stepped in front of the crossbow:*

**Gale:** Mind you, all I did was call for ale, but you went and stood in front of that crossbow. I'd drink to that.

*If someone else in the party did:*

**Gale:** Mind you, all I did was call for ale, but one of ours went and stood in front of that crossbow. I'd drink to that.
