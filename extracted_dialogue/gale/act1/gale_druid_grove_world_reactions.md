# Gale - Druid Grove World Reactions

## Nettie's Poison (After Receiving Antidote)

**Gale:** I can't believe she poisoned you, tried to put you down like a dying dog without as much as a whisper of consent!

*If defending Nettie, or noting she came around, or threatening her:*

**Gale:** Right? She had no right! *or* Yes - against her will, without rhyme or reason! *or* A taste of her own medicine is what she deserves!

**Gale:** How dare she snuff out life with as much thought as snuffing out a bloody candle?

*If asked if he's all right, or told to calm down:*

**Gale:** Yes. Yes, I am. It's just that, had it been me... Had it been... *or* I know. I know you are. And yet... A few moments more, a few different words spoken...

**Gale:** But you handled it, and you handled it well! As for myself, I could quite do with a tumbler full of Waterdeep Whiskey. Anyway. We live. For the moment. How about we go find that chap Halsin little miss Poison Ivy mentioned? With a bit of luck he has the means to offer us a cure rather than a coffin.

### Alternative: Dismissive Response

*If told to move on:*

**Gale:** It's not right to feel the cold breath of death in your neck, then move on as if it was nothing but a soothing breeze. One respects life by fighting for it, and one respects death by fearing it. Anyway. We live. For the moment. How about we go find that chap Halsin little miss Poison Ivy mentioned? With a bit of luck he has the means to offer us a cure rather than a coffin.

## Harpy Child Rescue (Saving Mirkon)

**Gale:** That scamp reminds me of myself when I was a nipper. Always getting into trouble.

*Various responses lead to:*

**Gale:** And worse. *or* Comes with the territory. *or* The straight and narrow is a boring road to walk, my friend.

**Gale:** One time my parents denied me a kitten, so I summoned myself a tressym. Dear old Tara. Beautiful creature. Benefits of a wizard's education, you see. Of course my considerable talent didn't hurt either. Well... That depends on who you ask, I suppose. I may have summoned things rather more exotic than a winged cat.

*If asked what else he summoned:*

**Gale:** There was that magma mephit once. Nice fellow - we kept in touch. *or if the mephit has appeared:* There was that magma mephit once. K'ha'ssji'trach'ash, in fact. You met him.

**Gale:** Of course, in walked the housekeeper. Screaming, yelling, panic, and before you knew it: fire everywhere. Anyway, I'm glad we got that boy out of his predicament. Poor lad would have been harpy feed if it wasn't for you.

### Sorcerer Responses

**Player:** *(Sorcerer)* The idea of a magic education is bizarre to me. I had to learn or die.

**Gale:** Whether the source is blood or books, magic is hard to master. Do or die indeed.

---

**Player:** *(Sorcerer)* Bet that took hours of preparation. I can do it without thinking.

**Gale:** And I can pass water without thinking, but that hardly makes it magic.

### Wild Magic Sorcerer Responses

**Player:** *(Wild Magic Sorcerer)* At least when you summoned a winged cat, that's what actually appeared...

**Gale:** Ha! Go on...

**Player:** I accidentally summoned an infant aboleth. It was... not friendly.

**Gale:** Well, well, quite the scamp yourself, aren't you? Luckily they're more fins than fangs at that age.

---

**Player:** *(Wild Magic Sorcerer)* At least when you summoned a winged cat, that's what actually appeared...

**Gale:** Ha! Go on...

**Player:** I turned blue with orange stripes. Took a tenday to change back.

**Gale:** At least you were never in want of pyjamas.

---

**Player:** *(Wild Magic Sorcerer)* At least when you summoned a winged cat, that's what actually appeared...

**Gale:** Ha! Go on...

**Player:** A cow dropped out of the sky. Her name was Stephanie.

**Gale:** So you made a cow drop out of the sky, which presumably killed it, and yet somehow you found out her name was Stephanie... I think I'll need a drink with the rest of that story.

### Alternative: Dismissive Response

*If told to stop chattering:*

**Gale:** Right. Bound to be more urchins to save around here.

## Kagha's Snake (Saving Arabella)

**Gale:** That woman has more venom in her heart than a snake in its fangs, but at least the child is safe. What is youth if not a time to be forgiven for one's transgressions?

*If agreeing the display was monstrous:*

**Gale:** Couldn't agree more. The girl wasn't innocent, but that doesn't mean she was guilty.

*If noting forgiveness requires learning:*

**Gale:** Come, let's cut the kid some slack, shall we? She didn't deserve this madcap spectacle as far as I'm concerned.

*If suggesting he has something to confess:*

**Gale:** Ha! And you don't? You're wholly without vice or sin or the occasional lapse in judgement? No - you don't strike me as quite that boring.
