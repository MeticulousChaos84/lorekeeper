## What Does Our Relationship Mean to You?

**Gale:** You must know, our relationship is the brightest spot in our otherwise bleak endeavour. To know you love me for the man I am, and not the magic I command... None have loved me so purely before. You are everything to me, and yet our relationship is only a nascent fraction of what it will become. You give me hope, and I've not had that in some time.

## Do You Still Harbor Feelings for Mystra?

**Gale:** Plenty of them. And all complicated. It's not easy to turn away from one you once loved, but now that I see our relationship with all the illumination hindsight has to offer, I mostly feel only regret. I was not the first wizard to fall under her spell, nor will I be the last. I was an amusement to her, a mortal to be trifled with, amused, and eventually discarded. I regret the way I hurt her. Of course I do. But she would have seen me destroy myself to earn her forgiveness. There is no love lost between us. None at all.

## Do You Truly Love Me?

**Gale:** I'm many things to many people, but I'm never a man to throw the l-word around lightly. I said exactly what I meant: I love you. You should never, *never* doubt that.

## Am I the First Mortal You've Been With?

**Gale:** What a question... No, you are not the first. Though you are the first since my relationship with Mystra came to its ignominious end. When the true danger posed by my condition became apparent, I had no choice but to sequester myself away from civilised society. A reclusive wizard - who'd have thought? After so long with Mystra, I have to say the pleasures of mortal love are much sweeter than I remember. Though perhaps that's simply because it's with you.

## How Are You Feeling?

### When Willing to Die (Pre-Colony)

**Gale:** Oh, you know. Filled with the bottomless dread that can only come from your own impending and self-inflicted death. Glad to have met you though. At least I'm going out on a high.

### When Not Willing to Die (Pre-Colony)

**Gale:** Grateful, mostly. For meeting you. For having someone who cares that I'm here, alive, and not reduced to a cloud of Netherese vapour. Someone apart from my tressym, that is.

### When in the Colony (Willing to Die)

**Gale:** Trying not to think about what lies ahead, if I'm being honest. I'd have hoped to spend our final moments together somewhere more romantic, but it seems we won't have much of a say in the matter.

### When in the Colony (Not Willing to Die)

**Gale:** Worried, if I'm being honest. I have so much to live for - more than I thought I'd have again, after Mystra. But being in this place, knowing what lies within poses such a threat... I hope the only heart that's broken here is the Absolute's. I'd never forgive myself for breaking yours.

### After the Colony (Debriefing Complete, Not Willing to Use Crown)

**Gale:** Glad to be alive, but mostly frustrated that we came so close to the source of our strife - that *brain* - and left it intact. Still, each new dawn with you is a blessing I didn't dare to hope for. Selfish as I'm no doubt being - I'm grateful for that.

### After the Colony (Willing to Use Crown, Not Eager)

**Gale:** More excited than I've been in months. I can't tell you how curious I am to learn more about the crown controlling that elder brain. Believe me when I say how important this could be for me. For both of us. Potentially lifesaving, so long as we can learn how it can be taken, and used.

### After the Colony (Eager for Crown)

**Gale:** Wonderful. At last, I can see a path ahead that doesn't end with me needing to turn this city into a desolate wasteland. I'm not sure I'd be brave enough for such a dream without you by my side. So, thank you. For believing in me.

### When Pursuing the Crown Together

**Gale:** The same way as you are, I hope. Determined. Focused. A tad impatient. With the crown, our fates will be in our own hands at last. So long as we don't let go of each other.

### When Ready to Die

**Gale:** Like I missed a golden opportunity. And now I'm going to pay a far higher price for the same prize. When the time comes for the orb to fulfil its purpose, I will think of only one thing. Your face. Nothing else will matter.

### When Uncertain About the Path Ahead

**Gale:** At a loss, really. People have always commented on my confidence, sometimes my over-confidence, and in one particularly cut-throat assessment at university - my 'abject and incorrigible self-delusion.' To put my faith in someone else, and trust that we will find a better way together... it's a rather new experience for me. One I'm enjoying, for the most part. But a new one nonetheless.
