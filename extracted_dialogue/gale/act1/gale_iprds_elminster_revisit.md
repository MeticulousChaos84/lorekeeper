# Gale: Elminster Revisit

**Context:** After Gale has read the Annals of Karsus and learned about the Crown, Elminster returns with a message from Mystra. This conversation occurs when speaking with Gale in the party.

## Reflecting on Mystra's Attention

**Gale:** So, all it took to get Mystra's attention was to learn how to reforge an artefact that once destroyed her. Obvious, when you stop to think about it.

---

### What Does She Want?

**Gale:** Well, I doubt it's an apology for asking me to die on her behalf. Whatever it is, if it's important enough to send Elminster, we can be damned sure she's serious.

This is a conversation that's long overdue on both sides. I owe it to her to hear her out, come what may afterwards.

### She's Scared of You

*[If player previously encouraged Gale toward the Crown]*

**Gale:** Not scared. Not yet. But she's shaken, if she feels the need to intervene directly.

This is a conversation that's long overdue on both sides. I owe it to her to hear her out, come what may afterwards.

### How Could She Know?

**Gale:** The Weave is a highly sensitive magical network threaded through all life on this plane. Any shift in magical energy, no matter how small, is akin to a beacon, alerting Mystra to its cause.

Opening a book like the Annals of Karsus was akin to us shooting a firework spelling 'look at us, Mystra' directly into the skies of Elysium. *She knows.*

This is a conversation that's long overdue on both sides. I owe it to her to hear her out, come what may afterwards.

---

### Are You Sure? She Might Punish You

**Gale:** I think Elminster's last message was the one carrying the punishment. Having respectfully declined it, I think she's willing to negotiate.

This is a conversation that's long overdue on both sides. I owe it to her to hear her out, come what may afterwards.

## Time to Go

*[If at Stormshore Tabernacle]*

**Gale:** After you.

---

*[If not at Stormshore Tabernacle]*

**Gale:** Very well, but it does not serve us to tarry when a summons from the heavens is waiting.

---

### Why Bother?

**Gale:** Mystra's many things, but she's no censor. Her job is not to judge those who use the Weave, but to ensure it is protected.

Whatever she has to say, I want to hear it. Only then will we know the truth of what lies ahead.
