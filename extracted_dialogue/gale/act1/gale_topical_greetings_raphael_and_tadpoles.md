## Raphael's First Visit

**Gale:** Do you feel as flattered as I do? Invited to dine with a devil...

**Gale:** Believe me, that was a devil's equivalent of serenades and roses. Don't let his bluster fool you. All that talk of desperation? It merely illustrates his own. I think he wants something from us. Badly. And in that knowledge lies our opportunity.

**Gale:** Conjecture, yes - that much I concede. But let me play the devil's advocate: the man is too eager. Do not dismiss his offer out of hand. If there's one quality all the denizens of the Hells embody, it's *ambition*. A quality they share with many humans, come to think of it...

**Gale:** Haven't the foggiest. But based on the evidence before us, we can make certain deductions as to *why* he sought out our merry band. Fact one: there's something very strange and very powerful about our tadpoles. Fact two: a devil offers to take it away. Devils aren't known to aid mortals out of simple kindness. Whatever Raphael wants, *we* must be the key to getting it. Along with our tadpoles...

**Gale:** So I say for now - we wait. If I'm right, Raphael will seek us out again. And when he does, there's a mighty bargain to be made. Remember his Cormyrian rhyme? 'Down came the claw'. Perhaps we should start growing our nails.

## Raphael - Deal Refused

**Gale:** You made a good decision, refusing that devil's contract. We'll speak more on this later, but suffice it to say for now - that crown is *vital* to our purpose here.

## Mizora on Wyrm's Crossing

**Gale (to Wyll):** Mizora one step ahead of you as always. What chaos will we deal with in her wake, I wonder?

**Gale (about Wyll):** Whatever business Wyll has with Mizora, it will cost him dearly. Or worse still, it will cost us. I hope we can afford it.

## Dream Visitor - First Dream

**Gale:** My apologies. I'm not quite myself just yet. I had the strangest dream last night. A visitor came to me, a vision of unparalleled beauty and power. She told me she was watching over me, protecting me. And, that our tadpoles could prove beneficial, if we embrace what powers they have to offer. An uncanny apparition. I'm not entirely sure what to make of it.

**Gale:** A real manifestation, perhaps. But not an individual of flesh and blood in the manner you or I would consider to be 'real.' Whether she spoke the truth or not... Well, I think I require a little more evidence before taking a fantasy at her word. Until then, best we speak of other matters. Was there something you wished to ask?

### Player Had Same Dream

**Gale:** Very curious. In all my readings on the effects of illithid parasites, I've never come across any accounts of correlating dreams between infected parties. Another unique quality of our predicament, perhaps. Are you inclined to take these visitors at their word?

**Gale (if skeptical):** Do not dismiss the truth of dreams out of hand. They can be portentous to quite alarming degrees. Still, your caution in this instance is well-advised. Let's see whether our dream visitors come good on their promises, or if they too were no more than a passing illusion.

**Gale (if uncertain):** Nothing wrong with maintaining a healthy suspicion in such matters. Still, it might be wiser to keep an open mind on the matter. Our visitors' promises of aid might yet bear valuable fruit.

**Gale (if trusting):** If so, we have far more to learn about the powers at play here. Our ignorance as to the exact nature and intent of our saviours is hardly cause for celebration. I hope your confidence proves well-founded. God knows we could use all the help we can get.

## Dream Visitor - Second Dream (The Absolute Mission)

**Gale:** I've been dreaming of our enigmatic visitor again. She told me our purpose was to take on this 'Cult of the Absolute', to infiltrate its ranks and bring it down from the inside. She even offered me greater powers, the result of some manipulation of the tadpole's psionic abilities. Given the magnitude of what we're up against, I see no harm in considering the benefit this offer might afford us. It could be the only way to reach this 'source' in one piece.

---

## First Tadpole Consumption

**Gale:** Come on then, don't leave me in suspense. How are you feeling? No errant tentacles? No sudden cravings for a more cerebral diet?

**Gale:** Wonderful. Advantages are a more precious commodity than I'd have hoped, given the nature of our predicament. I commend you on your willingness to take such a risk. Now, let's hope your new, illithid-fuelled prowess tip the balance suitably in our favour.

## Zaithisk Attempt Failed

**Gale:** Not the resounding success we were hoping for. Still, the price of ambition is occasionally catastrophic failure. At least our skulls remain intact.

---

## Zaithisk Destroyed

**Gale:** A crying shame, to see such a curious piece of githyanki engineering reduced to junk parts. Still, at least it wasn't *you* who ended up on the scrap heap. Yours was an escape narrow enough to defy even the tiniest of measuring sticks. Best to apply a touch more caution when agreeing to ambiguous medical procedures in future.

---

## Githyanki Patrol Encountered

**Gale (general):** Githyanki patrolling these wilds is an unexpected surprise. Whatever they seek, they'll not hesitate to kill us if we stand in their way.

**Gale (to Lae'zel):** I didn't expect to meet your kin patrolling these wilds so openly. Whatever they're seeking, they clearly feel no need to hide their efforts. Or their urgency.

## Vlaakith Visits - Lae'zel Accepts Mission

**Gale:** Who knew Vlaakith and Mystra would have so much in common? Both set on flinging their followers towards destruction without so much as deigning to justify it.

**Gale (to Lae'zel):** Your devotion is impressive, but be careful it's not fatal. Gods consider mortals like us a cheap token to trade in for their desired outcomes, at least in my experience.

**Gale (about Lae'zel):** Lae'zel's devotion is impressive, but if she's not careful it will be fatal. Gods consider mortals like us a cheap token to trade in for their desired outcomes, at least in my experience.

## Vlaakith Visits - Lae'zel Rejects Mission

**Gale:** Glad to see I'm not the only one on the wrong side of an omnipotent authority figure.

**Gale (to Lae'zel):** You did well to break free of Vlaakith's manipulations. Though I doubt Vlaakith will let such insubordination go unpunished.

**Gale (about Lae'zel):** Lae'zel did well to break free of Vlaakith's manipulations. Though I doubt Vlaakith will let such insubordination go unpunished.

## Voss Camp Visit - Lae'zel Sides with Voss

**Gale (to Lae'zel):** Quite the risk, to place your faith in the promises of one outside Vlaakith's control. I knew there was a rebellious streak in you somewhere. His intelligence may yet prove the key to unlocking the artefact's secrets. We should ensure we follow up when we reach Baldur's Gate.

**Gale (general):** What will Voss have to show for himself when we catch up with him, I wonder? His intelligence may yet prove the key to unlocking the artefact's secrets. We should ensure we follow up when we reach Baldur's Gate.

---

## Voss Camp Visit - Lae'zel Sides with Vlaakith, Kills Voss

**Gale:** That githyanki officer didn't come here merely to fill our ears with idle gossip. Who resides within the artefact, I wonder? Whatever Voss might have known about its occupant is lost to us now. Let's hope he and his alliance are aid we can do without.

## Planecaster Activated

**Gale (general):** We have our orders, from the queen of the githyanki herself, no less. Now might be the time to consider obeying them.

**Gale (to githyanki Tav):** We have our orders, from your queen herself, no less. Now might be the time to consider obeying them.
