# Gale: Romance Conflict Resolutions

**Context:** When the player has been dating Gale but then partners with another companion, Gale confronts them about the situation. These conversations show his dignity and grace in accepting rejection, while also expressing his hurt.

---

## General Opening

*[If dating Gale but partnered with someone else]*

**Gale:** Your cheeks are flush, there's a twinkle in your eye... but I think I am no longer the cause.

---

*[If this happens after the Last Night Alive scene]*

**Gale:** It seems you've found your heart's desire, but with someone else. And who would I be, to stand in the way of such a union?

I assume you didn't come here to seek my blessing, though. Was there something else you needed?

---

## Astarion Conflict

**Gale:** It is Astarion, isn't it? There's a new radiance about you, and I know I am not its cause.

I... I thought you would show me the respect of telling me first, but no matter. You can tell me now - who is it to be? Me, or him?

---

### I Want To Be With Astarion, I'm Sorry

**Gale:** It is as I feared, then. If that is what will make you happy... well, I am not the one who would stand in your way.

I may be no skilled swordsman, but you have dealt a wound nonetheless. With effort, however, I am sure I will heal. I always do.

---

### My Heart Has Room For Both Of You, If You're Willing To Share?

**Gale:** I doubt very much that Astarion would enjoy sharing. At least not without drinking his fill first. And neither would I.

That means it falls to you to choose. So choose. Who will it be?

---

#### I Don't Want To Let Go Of Either Of You

**Gale:** Then we find ourselves at an impasse. But know this: I *won't* share you. So either way, you must decide.

---

## Lae'zel Conflict

**Gale:** Lae'zel. I could scarcely believe it at first, but I've seen the glances you share, the way you lean into each other's whispers. There is something between you two.

To seek the heart of a githyanki warrior takes a good deal of courage. I can only think what you share must be quite serious, to brave such a task.

I... I thought you would show me the respect of telling me first, but no matter. You can tell me now - who is it to be? Me, or her?

---

### I Want To Be With Lae'zel, I'm Sorry

**Gale:** If that is what will make you happy... well, I am not the one who would stand in your way.

I may be no skilled swordsman, but you have dealt a wound nonetheless. With effort, however, I am sure I will heal. I always do.

---

### Just Because I Share Something With Lae'zel Doesn't Mean You And I Need Drift Apart...

**Gale:** We'll have to disagree on that score - competing against a githyanki warrior would be very poor for my health.

That means it falls to you to choose. So choose. Who will it be?

---

## Shadowheart Conflict

**Gale:** It's Shadowheart, isn't it? For one who guards her secrets so closely, she's made no attempt at hiding how much she wants you.

I... I thought you would show me the respect of telling me first, but no matter. You can tell me now - who is it to be? Me, or her?

---

### I Want To Be With Shadowheart, I'm Sorry

**Gale:** If that is what will make you happy... well, I am not the one who would stand in your way.

I may be no skilled swordsman, but you have dealt a wound nonetheless. With effort, however, I am sure I will heal. I always do.

---

### My Heart Has Room For Both Of You, If You're Willing To Share?

**Gale:** Shadowheart doesn't seem the type to share her toys, never mind her lovers. Neither am I.

That means it falls to you to choose. So choose. Who will it be?

---

## Wyll Conflict

**Gale:** It is Wyll, yes? The connection is palpable - no tadpole required.

He is a good man - I will not hesitate to say so. But I had hoped I was a good man also. And a worthy one.

I... I thought you would show me the respect of telling me first, but no matter. You can tell me now - who is it to be? Me, or him?

---

### I Want To Be With Wyll, I'm Sorry

**Gale:** Not for me to stand in your way, then. You two will make a fine couple... I can picture it already.

I may be no skilled swordsman, but you have dealt a wound nonetheless. With effort, however, I am sure I will heal. I always do.

---

### I Share Something Special With Wyll - But With You Also. That Needn't Change.

**Gale:** I'm not sure Wyll's family would appreciate their heir apparent being forced to share.

That means it falls to you to choose. So choose. Who will it be?

---

## Karlach Conflict

**Gale:** I... I thought you would show me the respect of telling me first, but no matter. You can tell me now - who is it to be? Me, or her?

---

### I Want To Be With Karlach, I'm Sorry

**Gale:** If that is what will make you happy... well, I am not the one who would stand in your way.

I may be no skilled swordsman, but you have dealt a wound nonetheless. With effort, however, I am sure I will heal. I always do.

---

## Minthara Conflict

**Gale:** Don't worry, I know Minthara insisted on you abandoning me. Or at least I assume I'm 'the wizard' she was referring to.

I'm happy to stay as your friend, for as long as you'll have me. Though I'll keep a safe distance from your new lover, if that's all the same to you. Now, did you seek me out for a reason?

---

## Common Endings

### After Choosing The Other Companion

**Gale:** I may be no skilled swordsman, but you have dealt a wound nonetheless. With effort, however, I am sure I will heal. I always do.

### I Don't Want To Let Go Of Either Of You

**Gale:** Then we find ourselves at an impasse. But know this: I *won't* share you. So either way, you must decide.
