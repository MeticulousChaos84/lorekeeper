# Gale's Reaction to Nettie's Poisoning

**Location:** Druid Grove - After surviving Nettie's poison and obtaining the antidote
**Context:** A druid called Nettie poisoned the party because she didn't want to run the risk they'd turn into mind flayers and destroy the druid grove. The party convinced her to give them the antidote. Gale is upset by what happened and starts out uncharacteristically angry.

## Dialogue

*If the player was poisoned:*

**Gale:** I can't believe she poisoned you, tried to put you down like a dying dog without as much as a whisper of consent!

*Or, if the party was threatened but not poisoned:*

**Gale:** I can't believe she wanted to poison us, that she tried to put us down like dying dogs without as much as a whisper of consent!

*Gale's anger continues:*

**Gale:** How dare she snuff out life with as much thought as snuffing out a bloody candle?

*When asked if he's all right:*

**Gale:** Yes. Yes, I am. It's just that, had it been me... Had it been...

*Gale collects himself:*

**Gale:** But you handled it, and you handled it well! As for myself, I could quite do with a tumbler full of Waterdeep Whiskey.

**Gale:** Anyway. We live. For the moment.

**Gale:** How about we go find that chap Halsin little miss Poison Ivy mentioned? With a bit of luck he has the means to offer us a cure rather than a coffin.

## Alternative Response

*If told to calm down and move on:*

**Gale:** It's not right to feel the cold breath of death in your neck, then move on as if it was nothing but a soothing breeze. One respects life by fighting for it, and one respects death by fearing it.
