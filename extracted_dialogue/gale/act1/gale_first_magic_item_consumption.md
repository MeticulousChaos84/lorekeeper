# Gale: First Magic Item Consumption

## Context
After consuming the first magical artifact to feed the orb, Gale experiences relief but remains evasive about the full details of his condition.

## That hit the spot.

I can feel it work. The magic is like a lullaby that sings to sleep the demon inside. A metaphorical demon I haste to point out. But no less dangerous - and no less bound to wake up again to continue its ravages. Such is the nature of all monsters.

## On Trust and Answers

Sincerely though: I understand I ask a lot from you with few answers in return, but in time all will be told.

### On His Condition

Oh, it's not so bad once you get used to it. And on the plus side, my tower in Waterdeep has never been so free of clutter.

### On the "Monster" Within

My words. My actions. My award winning smile.

### On the Value of the Artifact

I myself am a much more powerful artefact in your arsenal. Rest assured of that.

### From Waterdeep

I obtained it in Waterdeep. Nothing there comes cheap.
