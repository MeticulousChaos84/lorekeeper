# Gale: The Annals of Karsus

**Context:** When the party obtains the Annals of Karsus - a tome written by the legendary archwizard himself - Gale is immediately drawn to it. This conversation takes place when he examines the book and discovers its true significance.

---

## Initial Examination

**Gale:** *The Annals of Karsus*... The preamble to a civilisation's downfall, committed to parchment by the very hand that wrought its destruction.

I remember hearing of this tome - Netherese secrets passed down over millennia, its existence only rumoured. And here it is... in my hands.

If my suspicions are correct, the crown currently perched atop the elder brain may be one of Karsus' design. And now we hold the very tome that could confirm it.

---

### Did You Really Just Open a Dangerous Book?

**Gale:** The Weave already links us to the book - the tome can sense our magical energies, and it responded.

And yes, you should absolutely be concerned. But not because of any danger from the book. Because of what it could do in the wrong hands.

---

### You've Heard of Karsus

**Gale:** *Heard* of him? My child, Karsus is the source of all my research, my inspiration, my obsession. I've wondered my entire life what exactly happened - this book may hold the answers.

---

### Why This Book In Particular?

**Gale:** Its title gives it away: Annals of Karsus. This is his work. The final scribblings of a man about to become a god.

His spell worked. For one brief moment, he assumed the powers of the goddess Mystryl, only for Mystra's predecessor to sacrifice herself rather than let him control the Weave.

The rest is history. And I *will* know more.

---

## Reading the Tome

*[After confirming he should read]*

**Gale:** This is no ordinary artefact. These texts are ancient and complex, but there is no cipher my superior intellect cannot breach.

*[Reading in concentrated focus]*

*The Annals of Karsus*... such wonderful detail. Such exquisite diagrams of spellcraft...

One section seems to stand out. This passage details the exact construction of the Crown and the Netherstones. Karsus' greatest feat. The spells, the invocations, even... a design one could follow.

---

### A Design You Could Follow?

**Gale:** Not from scratch - unless you happen to have several pounds of the purest Netherese metals in that pack of yours?

Don't worry - I'm not asking you to surrender anything else on my account. What's called for here is something altogether different.

---

### How Did Such a Powerful Object End Up With the Absolute?

**Gale:** I haven't the foggiest. No doubt through some nefarious means - the crown's existence had been consigned to legend centuries ago.

---

## The Crown's Origins

**Gale:** The book states that the Crown and Netherstones were originally one construct, seemingly sundered at the moment of Karsus' downfall.

If we can collect the crown's setting, and the three Netherstones, and with the correct invocation of certain spells and gestures detailed in these notes... I *think* I could reforge it.

---

### Karsus? Crown? You Might Need To Catch Me Up

**Gale:** Karsus. The child-who-would-become-a-god. He was the most powerful wizard ever known... and he attempted to unseat the goddess of magic herself.

Only she used the last of her power to block him from the Weave. His magic faltered. The great flying cities of Netheril plunged from the sky. Karsus' Folly.

That goddess of magic was reborn as Mystra. She ruled on, while Netherese magic was reduced to mere fragments of what Karsus once wielded - artefacts, the most powerful of which appears to be his Crown.

---

### To What End?

**Gale:** To every end you can imagine, and a thousand more beyond.

---

### That Crown's Caused Chaos. We Should Destroy It, Not Make It More Powerful

**Gale:** Do not mistake the crown itself for the actions of its wearer, or rather, those *controlling* its wearer at present.

If we could restore its former glory, it would no longer be a mere leash and collar, used to subjugate friend or foe. It would be something greater. Something *divine*.

---

### You 'Think'? What Happens If You Fail?

**Gale:** Well, there'd be risk in such an endeavour, but only proportionate to the reward.

---

### Aren't You Forgetting Something? We Have To Hand The Crown To Raphael

*[If player made a deal with Raphael]*

**Gale:** A situation I suggest we remedy with the utmost urgency.

I promise you - the power such an item would give us is worth transcending all nine Hells for. The heavens too, while we're at it.

---

## Divine Aspirations

**Gale:** Just think of it... the power of the gods in mortal hands at last. We'd be free of doctrine and dogma, confined only by the limits of our imaginations.

---

### For Partner - Private Discussion

*[If in exclusive relationship with Gale]*

**Gale:** We must discuss this further - but quietly. *Privately.*

Find me later, and I will show you something truly divine. I will show you what a crown like this could mean for *both* of us.

---

#### Until Tonight, Then

**Gale:** I can hardly wait.

---

#### Can't You Just Tell Me Now?

**Gale:** Afraid not. What I have to show you requires us to be its only witness, and our minds to share in the most exquisite concentration.

Don't worry - your patience will be amply rewarded.

---

#### That Crown Is An Abomination, Gale

**Gale:** Please - don't be too hasty about this. It would be a pity to reach that conclusion without a true understanding of what this could mean for us.

Don't worry - your patience will be amply rewarded.

---

## Discussion of Mystra and the Gods

*[If not partnered with Gale]*

**Gale:** I promise you - the gods will *never* grant us such a blessing, no matter how much we worship and adore them.

---

### You Dismiss The Entire Pantheon So Easily

**Gale:** Some gods may delude themselves into believing they care about their worshippers, but when it comes down to it - we're all expendable. Children to be appeased, not respected.

I worshipped Mystra loyally for years, and in that time she granted me the barest sliver of the power I was ready to wield.

Even with the fate of the world at stake, she had little more to offer me than the means of blowing myself up at a more convenient time. She's done *nothing* to help us.

Mystra wanted the brain obliterated *because* of this crown. She fears a world in which such power is beyond her control - ready to be claimed by Karsus' successor.

---

### And You Think Mystra Will *Let* You Do This?

**Gale:** I don't know. Ao does not look kindly on gods meddling in mortal affairs - she may have no choice but to stand by and let events unfold.

---

### Mortals Are Far Better Guardians Of Their Fates

**Gale:** Then you're already wiser than me. That's a lesson I've only recently learned.

---

### So You Want The Crown To Settle A Score With Mystra?

**Gale:** She sent me to die.

Ambition is not a sin. To question the powers that rule us is not treason. We must at least try - why wallow in the dirt when we can reach for the stars?

---

### This Is No Ordinary Artefact. You'd Challenge The Gods Themselves

**Gale:** Perhaps they deserve to be challenged. Perhaps you and I deserve better than to live and die as their pawns.

---

### And You Believe Yourself To Be Karsus' Successor?

**Gale:** Not until this moment, but I can't help beginning to see such a destiny unfold before me.

---

### The Attempt Would Kill You As It Killed Karsus

**Gale:** Do you think I had not considered that? I have no intention of repeating his folly.

Powerful as he was, Karsus lacked some advantages I can lay claim to.

I know Mystra - intimately. And I carry a fragment of the Weave itself within my body. Karsus achieved many things, but he never managed that.

---

## Player Pushes Gale Away From The Crown

---

### I Thought You Were Past This Kind Of Temptation

**Gale:** Neither of us can know what truly may be if we don't at least try. Potential is nothing in itself - just a fleeting dream, unless we drag it into the waking world. Please, at least think on it.

A long road lies ahead before the Crown comes into our possession. All I ask for now is that you not dismiss this possibility out of hand. Please - at least think on it.

---

### Gale - I'm Urging You To Drop This. This Crown *Cannot* Be Reforged

**Gale:** I see. I suppose I am asking you to take a leap of faith even the most loyal of companions might struggle to land gracefully.

I've spent so long feeling... inferior, shut out from my destiny over such a simple act of youthful enthusiasm.

Perhaps I got carried away with the thought this Crown could give me back what Mystra took. Cure me, even.

---

#### You're *Still* Destined For Greatness, Gale. But Not Chasing Karsus' Shadow

**Gale:** You're right. There aren't many wizards who'd care to be mentioned in the same breath as him, or his folly.

It gives me some courage, to think that you see greatness in me. I hope I live up to your expectations.

---

#### Don't Give Up Yet. There Will Be An Answer - It Just Isn't The Crown

**Gale:** Very well then - I will try my utmost to share in your optimism. Nothing wrong with a little hope, after all.

It gives me some courage, to think that you see greatness in me. I hope I live up to your expectations.

---

#### You're Deluded, Gale. The Crown Is Clearly Dangerous

**Gale:** Of course it's dangerous - but that's hardly a unique quality when it comes to the purposes we've pursued together.

Regardless - you've made your point. I shall put thoughts of the crown aside for the time being.

It gives me some courage, to think that you see greatness in me. I hope I live up to your expectations.

---

### I Promise To Think About It

**Gale:** That's all I ask.

---

## Conclusion

*[If player knew about Crown from Raphael]*

**Gale:** Whatever comes of this, we *cannot* allow the Crown to be reforged in Raphael's image.

A devil wielding the might of Karsus... it would be the end of *everything*.

---

*[Standard ending]*

**Gale:** For now - we've learned all we can.

At least we can face our enemy armed with the knowledge of its true nature. And of the stakes, should we fail to defeat it.

---

*[If player gave Gale the book]*

**Gale:** Thank you for letting me read this. At least we can face our enemy armed with the knowledge of its true nature. And of the stakes, should we fail to defeat it.
