## My Relationship with Mystra

Such was my skill that it earned me the attention of the mother of magic herself. The Lady of Mysteries. The goddess Mystra. She revealed herself to me and she became my teacher. In time, she became my muse, and later, even my lover.

Oh yes. We enjoyed each other's company - body, mind and soul. But even so, I desired more. You see, no matter how powerful a wizard we mortals can become, we never scratch more than the surface of the Weave. Mystra keeps us in check. There are boundaries she doesn't let us cross. Yet every time I was with her, I stood on the precipice, gazing into the wonders that lay beyond. I sought to cross her boundaries.

## Seeking to Prove Myself

I tried to convince her. I pouted, I pleaded, I swore my ambition was only to serve her better. But she only smiled and told me to be contented. As inconceivable as it seems to me now, I shared a bed with a goddess and yet I wasn't satisfied. So I sought to prove myself worthy to her instead.

## The Tale of the Netherese Book

Once upon a very long time ago, a mighty lord lived in a tower. A flying tower, to be precise. I'll save his history for another time, but the gist of it is that he sought to usurp the goddess of magic so that he could become a god himself. He almost managed, but not quite, and his entire empire - Netheril - came crashing down around him as he turned to stone.

The magic unleashed that day was phenomenal, roiling like the prime chaos that outdates creation. Even the Weave itself could not withstand the onslaught. It fractured, then shattered, and all magic was lost to the mortal realms until the day Mystra returned. She restored the Weave, reuniting all its scattered shards. Or so I thought, until in the course of my studies I learned of a book. A Netherese tome in which a piece of the fractured Weave had been sealed beyond her reach.

'What if', I thought, 'What if after all this time, I could return this lost part of herself to the goddess?' I was certain that this deed of raw power draped in romance would convince Mystra to take me by the hand and welcome me into her hitherto forbidden domains.

## I Was Mistaken

I obtained the fabled book and took it into my study. Here. Place your hand over my heart. Let me show you.

*[Through the tadpole connection, you experience Gale's memory: You see through Gale's eyes, staring down the corridors of a dread memory. A book, bound, then suddenly opened. Inside there are no pages, only a swirling mass of blackest Weave that pounces. Its teeth, its claws, it's unstoppable as it digs through and becomes part of you. And gods, is it ever-hungry...]*

Terrifying isn't it? And that is only the beginning.

## The Orb

This Netherese blight... this *orb*, for lack of a better word, is balled up inside my chest. And it needs to be fed. As long I absorb traces of the Weave from potent enough sources, it remains quiet. Were it ever to fully destabilise, however...

I will erupt. I don't know the exact magnitude of the eruption, but given my studies of Netherese magic, I'd say even a fragment as small as the one I carry... It'd level a city the size of Waterdeep.

## The Choice: Stay or Go

All of this... It must feel like a betrayal. Say the word, and we'll part ways.

### If the Party Supports Him

That is - a great relief. Oh, a great relief indeed! You truly are a soul that steels my own. From all my new-rallied heart I thank you. I thank you all. I understand if you stand against me. I'm humbled if you stand with me. Either way, I will do my best not to let you down.

I stand at a precipice, but if you do not give up hope, neither shall I. I'll fight, I'll resist - as long as I can.

Now - even I am tired of the sound of my own voice. Let us venture forth.

## If Asked: Where Would You Go?

I would consume some Midnight Tears and venture as deep into the Underdark as I possibly could, until they cloud my eyes forever. With a bit of luck I'd manage to make it to a mind flayer colony, so that when the orb erupts, one loud, last song of vengeance would reverberate through the dark. It wouldn't be a heroic end, but coarsely poetic enough in its justice.
