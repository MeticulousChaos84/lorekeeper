## Initial Approach (If Not Yet Spoken To)

**Gale:** Enjoy the night. It seems to me full of opportunities.

---

## Main Conversation - Romance Path Available

**Gale:** Thank you. *[He looks at you with a big smile, the words warm and heartfelt.]*

**Gale:** There's that confidence I like.

or

**Gale:** I'm glad you sought me out. Amid all this merriment I wasn't sure we'd have a chance to speak this evening.

or

**Gale:** Come now! This is a night for celebration, not suspicion.

**Gale:** I thank you for seeking me out. Amidst all this merriment I wasn't sure we'd have a chance to speak this evening.

### If Single and Romantically Interested

**Gale:** I wasn't sure we'd have a chance to make merry, just the two of us.

**Gale:** As they say in Waterdeep: in wine there is truth. That's usually followed by: in water there is good sense. Good sense will have to wait 'til the morrow.

or

**Gale:** We shared a romantic moment of the mind while cloaked in the Weave, didn't we? And I seem to recall a fond allusion to that moment afterwards.

or

**Gale:** Perhaps that's a moment we ought to further explore.

or

**Gale:** We had a moment, you and I, a moment in which we expressed the possibility of becoming more than friends. Tonight seems perfectly suited for such endeavours.

**Gale:** Allow me to make the following proposition:

**Gale:** There's a book that circulates in Amn, detailing the first thousand nights of a newlywed king and queen. They turned everything they did into an art. The art of conversation. The art of taste, time honoured and newly acquired. The art of the body. The exploration and acceptance of the self and the other. The art of the night itself.

**Gale:** I say we take a page from their book.

**Gale:** Forget the book then. Let's be blank slates on blank sheets, delightfully new.

or

**Gale:** I'm many things, but coy's not one of them.

or

**Gale:** Then we'll start writing the prequel.

**Gale:** What do you say?

**Gale:** That's because I'm full of delights. We'll let the night run its course. And when everything is quieting down, safe in the arms of sleep, I'll come by to find safety in yours.

#### Alternative: Declining the Proposition

**Gale:** Too bad. One should never be afraid to live life to the fullest.

#### Alternative: Expressing Doubt

**Gale:** That's because you've yet to find out what you're missing. Doubt is a spoilsport. Cast it aside.

**Gale:** A match made... not quite in heaven, but close enough. We'll let the night run its course. And when everything is quieting down, safe in the arms of sleep, I'll come by to find safety in yours.

## If Player Has Already Chosen Another Partner

**Gale:** That, my friend, must remain a secret. For now. Or rather: for as long as you've eyes only for someone else among our troupe. Another night perhaps.

**Gale:** But before you go... I know there are many things about me that remain shrouded in mystery. You've been very patient with me, and I appreciate that.

**Gale:** You've given me powerful magic to consume when I needed it most. *[If applicable]*

**Gale:** You've brought me back from the grey shores of death. *[If applicable]*

**Gale:** You know of my condition, and you know about my unfortunate efforts to win Mystra's favour, but those are but the broad strokes.

or

**Gale:** You know of my condition and its challenges, but those are but the broad strokes.

**Gale:** The time has come to paint you the true picture. I can only hope my tale will live up to your expectations. Tonight, of course, we celebrate, and I won't keep you any longer. Tomorrow night though, you're in for quite the bedtime story.

or

**Gale:** Curiosity is a trait we all share. Tonight, of course, we celebrate, and I won't keep you any longer. Tomorrow night though, you're in for quite the bedtime story.

## Comments About Chosen Partners

**Gale:** More's the pity you've already found someone else to make merry with, just the two of you.

### If Chosen Astarion

**Gale:** He has a certain charm about him, Astarion. Then again, so does a tiger when it purrs.

### If Chosen Karlach

**Gale:** You might be in for an adventure with Karlach. More than you bargained for - with a bit of luck. Or perhaps more than you bargained for - full stop.

### If Chosen Lae'zel

**Gale:** Lae'zel. Blade like a razor, wit like a razor, tongue like a razor. I do hope you know what you're doing.

### If Chosen Shadowheart

**Gale:** There's something... unspeakable about Shadowheart. But I mean that in a good way. She seems to me like a bud on the cusp of bursting into a rose. That or deadly nightshade.

### If Chosen Wyll

**Gale:** Wyll's a good man. He may actually be a tried-and-true storybook hero. Then again he's so full of himself it's a small miracle he hasn't resorted to self-cannibalism yet.

### Jealousy Dialogue

**Gale:** Far be it from me of course, to question your tastes.

**Gale:** Caught on to that, did you? Might be the wine talking.

or

**Gale:** Jealousy is in the eye of the beholder. Or something along those lines, the wine might be befuddling me a smidge.

or

**Gale:** Am I? Perhaps I am. Or perhaps I need another glass of wine.

**Gale:** As they say in Waterdeep: in wine there is truth. That's usually followed by: in water there is good sense. Good sense will have to wait 'til the morrow.

**Gale:** But before you go... *[continues to bedtime story setup as above]*

### Alternative: Switching From Another Partner to Gale

**Gale:** Indeed?

*[If sufficient approval:]*

**Gale:** We shared a romantic moment of the mind while cloaked in the Weave, didn't we? *[continues to romance path as above]*

*[If insufficient approval:]*

**Gale:** You're all too quick to abandon the one you promised yourself to. That is not a quality I admire. No, I was glad you sought me out for an entirely different reason: *[continues to bedtime story setup]*

*[If no romantic history:]*

**Gale:** I'm sorry, but surely we're friends, allies, the best of companions, but... no more than that. No, I was glad you sought me out for an entirely different reason: to toast to victory and to offer you an invitation. *[continues to bedtime story setup]*

---

## Low Approval Rejection Path

**Gale:** It would... *[stops himself]* Actually, on second thought I can't think of it entailing anything particularly enticing at all. Forgive me, I seem to be of two minds and two moods. We'll blame the wine and leave it at that.

**Gale:** But before you go... *[continues to bedtime story setup]*

---

## If No Romance Available (Low Approval, No Romantic History)

**Gale:** Merely to share a glass of wine I suppose; to toast to victory and to offer you an invitation.

**Gale:** I know there are many things about me that remain shrouded in mystery. You've been very patient with me, and I appreciate that. *[continues to bedtime story setup as above]*

---

## If Romance Declined

**Gale:** Enjoy the night. It seems to me full of opportunities.

or

**Gale:** I've said enough. Let silence do the talking.

---

## If Romance Accepted (Already Partner)

**Gale:** There's promise in patience, I assure you. Let the night run its course so that we can run ours as well.
