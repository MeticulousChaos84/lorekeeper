# Gale's Reaction to Saving the Child from Kagha

**Location:** Druid Grove - After convincing Kagha to release Arabella
**Context:** The party saved a girl from a dangerous situation: the druid Kagha had her guarded by a snake because she stole a druidic idol. The party talked Kagha into letting the girl go.

## Dialogue

**Gale:** That woman has more venom in her heart than a snake in its fangs, but at least the child is safe. What is youth if not a time to be forgiven for one's transgressions?

*On the fairness of the situation:*

**Gale:** Couldn't agree more. The girl wasn't innocent, but that doesn't mean she was guilty.

*Or, if pressed about forgiveness:*

**Gale:** Come, let's cut the kid some slack, shall we? She didn't deserve this madcap spectacle as far as I'm concerned.

*Or, if teased about having something to confess:*

**Gale:** Ha! And you don't? You're wholly without vice or sin or the occasional lapse in judgement? No - you don't strike me as quite that boring.
