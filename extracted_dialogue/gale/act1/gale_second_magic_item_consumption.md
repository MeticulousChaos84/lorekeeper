# Gale: Second Magic Item Consumption (When Things Go Wrong)

## Context
After consuming the second magical artifact, Gale realizes something is wrong. The magic isn't having the same effect - it's not soothing the orb the way it should. This marks a concerning escalation in his condition.

## It is a strange experience each time anew - like a lost soul is spelunking through the darkness that is me, only to be sacrificed on the dread altar of the heart.

But... this doesn't feel quite right... It never feels *right*, but it relieves. This doesn't relieve... Ahh...

## What's Happening?

The magic isn't having the effect it should have. It's not like last time, like a rainstorm that quells a forest fire. It merely drizzles. The embers still sizzle. The fire remains undefeated.

I'm not certain what's going on, but nothing good. Please, I need to think... I need to retrace my steps to a glade of calm and think.

Thank you, for the artefact. A great deal of trouble it was to... A great deal of trouble indeed.

## On Concern

You do plenty for me, more than you realise. But this cannot be remedied.
