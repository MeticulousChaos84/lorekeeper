# Nightsong Discussion

*This conversation occurs after Elminster has given Gale the charm to detonate the orb (Act 2). The player asks if the Nightsong could save Gale from having to sacrifice himself.*

## Asking About the Nightsong

**Player:** The 'Nightsong' sounded useful. Could it save you from the orb's detonation? *or* The 'Nightsong' seems to grant invulnerability. Could she save you from the orb's detonation?

**Gale:** Alas, no. The charm Elminster granted me *requires* my death as the spark that will light the orb's fuse.

**Gale:** Making myself invulnerable, immortal or in any other fashion *unkillable* would render it useless. And gods only know what it might do to the orb itself...

**Gale:** Still, I see no harm in learning what we can about this 'Nightsong'. And, if we manage to find it, the harm will be all Ketheric's. So, well worth indulging our curiosity.

## Alternative: Knowing the Nightsong is Ketheric's Secret

*If you've learned that the Nightsong is the source of Ketheric's invulnerability:*

**Gale:** Still, what harms Ketheric helps us, and to deny him the source of his invulnerability would be a very efficient way of harming him indeed.
