## Asking Gale to Visit the Shrine

**Player:** I'd like you to meet me at Mystra's shrine. We should hear what she has to say.

**Gale:** Excellent idea. I'll be there bright and early tomorrow. *(if asking during daytime)*

*or*

**Gale:** I'll be there tomorrow. As will you, I hope - I'd rather not face this alone. *(if asking at night)*

*[Gale will then be removed from your party until you visit the shrine]*
