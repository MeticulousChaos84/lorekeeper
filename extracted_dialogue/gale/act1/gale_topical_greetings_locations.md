# Gale - Topical Greetings: Locations (Act 1)

**Source:** Gale_InParty2_Nested_TopicalGreetings.html

---

## Druid's Grove

**Gale:** I've never had cause to visit a druid's grove before. Magic weighs heavier here, seeking solace in root and soil. Grounding, one might say.

---

## Goblin Camp

**Gale:** Goblins aren't known for their cleanliness, but by Mystra's mantle, this place is rotten. The fewer breaths we take here, the better.

---

## Githyanki Crèche - Entering

**Gale (general):** A real githyanki crèche. Few outsiders learn the secrets of such places. Fewer still live to share their observations. A keen eye and a quiet tongue may serve us well here.

**Gale (to Lae'zel):** You can learn a lot about people when you understand the manner of their upbringing. Our time here will shed new light on your little quirks, I'm quite sure.

---

## Githyanki Crèche - Left Safely

**Gale:** Walking freely out of a githyanki crèche... A miracle if ever I've seen one. And trust me, I've seen quite a few.

---

## Githyanki Crèche - Stopped Destruction

**Gale:** Thank Mystra for that. Can't say I was enamored with the thought of spending my final moments buried under a thousand tonnes of limestone.

---

## Hag's Lair

**Gale:** Careful where you tread here. A hag's magic is not to be trifled with.

---

## Underdark

**Gale:** The underdark has a certain menacing beauty to it. Though I'd be happier admiring it from a safe distance.

---

## Burning Tavern (Waukeen's Rest)

**Gale:** Not sure now is the time for chatter. There's a raging inferno surrounding us.

---

## Nere Trapped

**Gale:** Nasty way to go, suffocating slowly under a tonne of rubble. Not a fate I'd personally relish.
