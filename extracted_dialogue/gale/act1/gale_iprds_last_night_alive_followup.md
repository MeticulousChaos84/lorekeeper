## Romantic Partner Follow-up

*[If in exclusive relationship with Gale]*

**Gale:** I wanted to talk to you about our night together...

### The Edge of the Void

**Gale:** Have you ever walked to the very edge of a great precipice, and shuddered at how easy it would be to step into the void?

Ever since Elminster told me of Mystra's... *expectations* of me, I have felt like I've been walking along such a cliff face, with a great drop to nothingness never out of my sight.

But you - you led me away from the edge.

Without your words, your touch... I fear I would have sought purpose and solace in that void. You reminded me what living can feel like.

---

### You Flatter Me

**Gale:** Well, generosity is always a noble virtue - whether it be in the streets, at the charity box, or betwixt the sheets.

*[If magical intimacy was shared]*

We are all sensual vessels. Illusory magic lets us sail farther, and feel more deeply.

*[If physical intimacy only]*

Besides, given my propensity towards verbosity, it surely can't be a surprise that I have a practised tongue.

I hope the end is much farther away than I had suspected. I hope that night meant as much to you as it did to me. And I hope we will have more time together. Together... alone.

---

### It Was Wonderful

**Gale:** I'll see that there is - woe betide anyone who tries to stop me.

---

### Keep Focused On That Feeling

**Gale:** Indeed. I'll guard my resolve like a lit flame in a... well, in a gale.

I hope the end is much farther away than I had suspected. I hope that night meant as much to you as it did to me. And I hope we will have more time together. Together... alone.

---

### It Was Magical In More Ways Than One

**Gale:** I had been hoping you'd say that. To be an object of pity... I couldn't live with that.

I hope the end is much farther away than I had suspected. I hope that night meant as much to you as it did to me. And I hope we will have more time together. Together... alone.

---

### I Can't Be Your Crutch

**Gale:** No crutch - I can stand tall now, thanks to you. You've renewed my taste for living. I will not be a burden to you.

I hope the end is much farther away than I had suspected. I hope that night meant as much to you as it did to me. And I hope we will have more time together. Together... alone.

## Non-Romantic Follow-up

*[If not in romantic relationship]*

**Gale:** I was hoping to speak to you, as a matter of fact. About the night you were kind enough to keep this melancholy wizard company...

---

### If Willing To Die

**Gale:** I suppose one might say I'm rather adrift, to be honest.

Since our conversation, I'd resigned myself to my fate. Each day bore the possibility of being my last, and I accepted it.

I'm only standing here now because I failed, to put it in rather blunt terms. Mystra is unlikely to let me try again. Yet, even in spite of that - I'm glad to have more time with you.

Since you still have me, was there anything else on your mind?

---

### If Talked Out of Dying

**Gale:** I wanted to... to thank you. I was sinking into a dark place, but you reminded me there is still light in the world, if I should care to look for it.

You... you may well have prevented me from doing something very rash in the near future. I count myself lucky to call you a friend.

---

### Any Time, Gale

**Gale:** Careful - I may just take you up on that.

---

### The Feeling Is Mutual

**Gale:** I'm glad to hear it. And I intend to prove myself worthy of the sentiment.

---

### I Don't Want To Be Collateral Damage

**Gale:** Understandable. And you won't be. Not if I can help it.
