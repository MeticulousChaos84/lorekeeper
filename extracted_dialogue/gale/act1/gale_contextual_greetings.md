## Romance - Acknowledging You Chose Him

**Gale:** I am as honoured as I am enamoured. I am not the only one who longs for you... yet you chose me. I must admit I am surprised - not to mention flattered, elated, and a little frightened. Such stiff competition... and yet you chose me.

### You Have An Eye for Quality

**Gale:** Then I'm glad to have met your standards. And intend to prove your appraisal more than correct.

### You're the Most Brilliant Person Here

**Gale:** Perhaps, but unbecoming of me to flat out *state* it. I will make it my mission to prove you made the right choice. A thousand times over.

### I Have My Doubts

**Gale:** The best cure for doubt is study and experimentation. And an experiment must be repeated thrice in order to ensure accuracy, of course. If you *did* want to repeat it thrice, I can make myself available...

### You're Handsome When Silent

**Gale:** Apologies - I am a babbling brook of romantic verbage. Consider my mouth sealed... until you have use for it, of course.

**Gale:** My time is yours. What do you need? / Whatever you need, you have only to ask. / Anything I can do for you - consider it most enthusiastically done.

---

## Established Romance (Post-Crown Decision)

**Gale:** Is something on your mind? You can always unburden yourself with me. / Are you all right? If you have need me, just say the word. / Yes, my love?

---

## Dating But Not Yet Committed

## When Elminster Is Waiting at Camp

**Gale:** Time we spoke with Elminster, I think. If we're lucky, we might catch him between courses. Unless there's something more pressing you wish to discuss?

**Gale:** It doesn't do to keep a wizard waiting, especially one of Elminster's reputation. Not to mention appetite. We should join him in camp at the first opportunity.

## At the Arcane Tower (Underdark)

**Gale:** A wizard's tower. Familiar territory for you as it is for me, no doubt. Imposing places, hiding their secrets well. / A word of advice - wizards' towers can be volatile places. They keep their secrets buried, and their dangers close to the surface.

One misplaced spell and you might find yourself thrown into Limbo, fighting off a Death Slaad with a *very* nasty temper. I'm sure whatever's on your mind poses no such risk, but caution is to be advised. Now, what can I do for you?

## When Wearing Haarlep's Bondage Gear (Romance)

**Gale:** You look... comfortable. I'd no idea you were inclined to such contraptions. Whatever oils your leather, I suppose. So, *ahem*, what's on your hind? I mean mind.

---

## When Wearing Haarlep's Bondage Gear (Not Romance)

**Gale:** You look... comfortable. A mite over-exposed, given the perils of our adventure, but I suppose it adds a thrilling edge to leave oneself to open to danger, and... other things. I assume your choice of apparel isn't the subject of the day. What's on your hind? I mean mind.

## When Weakened by the Orb

**Gale:** What's on your mind? Apart from finding me an artefact to consume, which I assume you're pursuing with the appropriate urgency. / You'll have to speak slowly. I'm finding quite difficult to concentrate with my condition gnawing at my insides like a teething displacer kitten.

## Asking If You're a Wizard

**Gale:** You have a familiar twinkle in your touch... you're a wizard, aren't you?

### If You Are

**Gale:** Would you consider yourself particularly well-read? The aid of someone learned would be of great use to me. You and I both know the aid a powerful sage could bring us. If you meet any elder wizards, let me know. There is a matter I'd like to seek advice on from a master.

#### If You Say You Read a Whole Book Every Day

**Gale:** The limited time for reading that undergoing ceremorphosis leaves pains me so.

#### If You Fail Your Exams

**Gale:** Mystra's elbow! We truly are doomed.

#### Don't Question My Education

**Gale:** My apologies, don't get your robes in a ruffle!

#### You're No Khelben Blackstaff

**Gale:** Oh, don't compare yourself to Khelben. He wastes far too much of his time dying.

### If You're Not a Wizard (But Have Magic)

**Gale:** Oh, I *do* apologise. I meant to ask: are you *studied* in magic. Namely: are you a wizard? Which you are not.
