# Gale's Recruitment: The Waypoint Extraction
**Location:** Roadside Cliffs (near nautiloid crash site)
**Act:** 1
**Participants:** Gale, Player
**Triggers:** Approaching and touching the malfunctioning waypoint sigil on the stone

---

**Narrator:** *You approach the sigil on the stone. Magic glitters and swirls from it erratically, as if malfunctioning. It looks slightly dangerous.*

**Narrator:** *(You reach out to touch the sigil. When you touch it, sparks fly, and you quickly retract your hand in pain, like accidentally touching a red-hot pan.)*

**Narrator:** *(Next, in the centre of the sparks, you suddenly see a hand and lower arm coming out of the sigil. The hand opens and closes, looking for something to hold on to. A voice resounds, or so it seems, from deep within the stone.)*

**Gale:** A hand? Anyone?

**Gale:** Just your average traveller stuck between realms. Pull me out and we'll get properly introduced.

**Gale:** Ow! Perhaps I should have clarified. A *helping* hand? Anyone?

**Gale:** That's it! Go on, keep pulling!

**Narrator:** *(You pull with all your might, and slowly the upper arm starts to emerge from the sigil. Then suddenly Gale stumbles out from the stone, wobbling a bit before regaining his balance.)*

**Gale:** Ooft, hello. I'm Gale of Waterdeep. Apologies, I'm usually better at this.

**Gale:** A bit shocked, but friend, it's a relief and a pleasure to make your acquaintance.

**Gale:** At magic. *(Gale wistfully glances behind him at the waypoint, thinking on how close a scrape it was. Foreshadowing of him mourning his former magical skills.)*

**Gale:** Say, but I know you, don't I? In a manner of speaking. You were on the nautiloid as well.

**Gale:** Then I can only assume you too were on the receiving end of a rather unwelcome insertion in the ocular region.

**Gale:** I don't know what transpired exactly, but the ship broke into pieces and I suddenly found myself in freefall. As I was plummeting to certain death, I spied a glimmer quite near where I estimated my body to impact with less-than-savoury propulsion.

**Gale:** Recognising this glimmer to be magical in nature, I reached out to it with a Weaving of words and found myself on the other side as it were. How about you? How did you survive the fall?

**Gale:** Fair enough. But even so, I have the unfortunate suspicion your survival is still very much in jeopardy.

**Gale:** Back on the ship, you too were on the receiving end of a rather unwelcome insertion in the ocular region, were you not?

**Gale:** No use sugarcoating it, is there?

**Gale:** And yet, if we indulge in the hypothetical for a moment... The insertee we speak of, this parasite - are you aware that after a period of excruciating gestation it will turn us into mind flayers? It's a process known as ceremorphosis, and let me assure you: it is to be avoided.

**Gale:** You don't happen to be a cleric, by any chance, do you? A doctor? Surgeon? Uncannily adroit with a knitting needle?

**Shadowheart:** You seem to know enough about our condition to realise it is beyond most clerics' skills. *(If Shadowheart is present)*

**Gale:** Most, no doubt. But I find myself hoping to be in the presence of the few. You don't happen to be one of them?

**Gale:** I can tend to basic wounds and ailments, but alien parasites? I'm afraid not. *(Sorcerer response)*

**Gale:** I suppose few enough can. It's not exactly a common affliction. We're most certainly going to need a healer, and soon too. How about we lend each other a helping hand once more and look for a healer together?

**Gale:** Most excellent. A parasite shared is a parasite halved. Or something to that effect.

**Gale:** Oh! But before you think you're about to embark on a journey with most ill-mannered a man: thank you for pulling me out of that stone. It was an act of foresighted kindness I assure you, for I have the feeling ample opportunities will present themselves for me to return the favour.

## Alternative Path: Player Hesitates or Declines Initially
---

**Gale:** Are you certain? There might be danger around the next corner, and a wizard is excellent company to keep.

---

## Alternative Path: Player Draws Weapon
---

**Gale:** Whoa - easy does it. You really, *really* don't want to do that. Not a threat, just an observation.

**Gale:** Much obliged. Besides, I suspect the real villain here is one we have in common.

**Gale:** Ten years of bad luck if you kill a wizard. Why take the risk? *(If player questions the warning)*

---

## Alternative Path: Failed Pull Attempts
---

**Gale:** Harder! Come on, put your back into it!

**Gale:** No! I'm slipping away! I'll perish in here!

**Gale:** I'll perish...! *(The hand disappears into the sparkles and the sigil becomes dormant. A cry of 'I'll perish!' echoes several times, sounding increasingly far away, like an echo. Then silence.)*

---

## Alternative Path: Wizard Attempting to Calm the Sigil
---

**Gale:** Whatever you're doing, it's working wonders! Now a quick little pull should do the trick.

---

## Alternative Path: If Player Previously Killed Gale Then Revived Him
---

**Gale:** My, I hope it has been made abundantly clear that to kill me is... counterproductive.

**Gale:** I'd thank you for bringing me back to life, but your ending it in the first place has me rather in two minds about you. That said, despite my return to the land of the living my predicament remains, and so of course does yours.

**Gale:** As such, I'm feeling magnanimous enough to let bygones be bygones. A healer is what we need. Shall we?

**Gale:** Most excellent! Then without further ado, let's be off! Here's hoping we come across a powerful healer and a powerful wizard both.

---

## Alternative Path: Sarcastic/Dismissive Response
---

**Gale:** Apologies, I didn't exactly memorise my cephalopodian banishment spells last night. Wasn't the best prepared for an attack-by-squid.
