# Gale's Recruitment: The Hand from the Stone
**Location:** Near the Roadside Cliffs waypoint, nautiloid crash site
**Act:** 1
**Participants:** Player, Gale, (possible companion interjections from Shadowheart)
**Triggers:** Approaching the malfunctioning waypoint sigil after the nautiloid crash

---

**Narrator:** *You approach the sigil on the stone. Magic glitters and swirls from it erratically, as if malfunctioning. It looks slightly dangerous.*

**Player:** *Touch the sigil.*

**Narrator:** *(Cine) You reach out to touch the sigil. When you touch it, sparks fly, and you quickly retract your hand in pain, like accidentally touching a red-hot pan.* *(Cine) Next, in the centre of the sparks, you suddenly see a hand and lower arm coming out of the sigil. The hand opens and closes, looking for something to hold on to. A voice resounds, or so it seems, from deep within the stone.*

**Gale:** A hand? Anyone?

**Player:** Who are you?

**Gale:** Just your average traveller stuck between realms. Pull me out and we'll get properly introduced.

---

## Alternative: Player slaps the hand

**Player:** *Slap the hand.*

**Gale:** Ow! Perhaps I should have clarified. A *helping* hand? Anyone?

---

## Pulling Gale Out

**Player:** *Grab the hand and pull.* [Strength check vs 7]

### If the check succeeds:

**Gale:** That's it! Go on, keep pulling!

**Narrator:** *(Cine) You pull with all your might, and slowly the upper arm starts to emerge from the sigil. Then suddenly Gale stumbles out from the stone, wobbling a bit before regaining his balance.*

**Gale:** Ooft, hello. I'm Gale of Waterdeep. Apologies, I'm usually better at this.

**Player:** No need to apologise. Are you all right?

**Gale:** A bit shocked, but friend, it's a relief and a pleasure to make your acquaintance.

**Gale:** Say, but I know you, don't I? In a manner of speaking. You were on the nautiloid as well.

**Player:** I was, yes.

**Gale:** Then I can only assume you too were on the receiving end of a rather unwelcome insertion in the ocular region.

---

### If the check fails:

**Gale:** Harder! Come on, put your back into it!

**Player:** *Pull again, as hard as you can.* [Strength check vs 12]

**Gale:** That's it! Go on, keep pulling!

*(Continues as above)*

---

## Alternative Approach: Wizard Calms the Weave

**Player:** *Whisper to the Weave roiling within the sigil. Attempt to calm it down.* *(Wizard tag)* [Intelligence check vs 7]

### If successful:

**Gale:** Whatever you're doing, it's working wonders! Now a quick little pull should do the trick.

*(Leads to successful extraction)*

## Discussing the Crash

**Player:** Never mind the nautiloid. How did you get stuck in that stone?

**Gale:** I don't know what transpired exactly, but the ship broke into pieces and I suddenly found myself in freefall.

**Gale:** As I was plummeting to certain death, I spied a glimmer quite near where I estimated my body to impact with less-than-savoury propulsion.

**Gale:** Recognising this glimmer to be magical in nature, I reached out to it with a Weaving of words and found myself on the other side as it were.

**Gale:** How about you? How did you survive the fall?

**Player:** To be honest, I haven't a clue.

**Gale:** Fair enough. But even so, I have the unfortunate suspicion your survival is still very much in jeopardy.

---

## Alternative: Boastful response

**Player:** I took control of the ship, landed it safely and saved the day.

**Gale:** That vast, burning wreckage behind you somewhat contradicts your story, but here you stand, so who am I to argue?

**Gale:** Still, swashbuckling heroics aside, I have the unfortunate suspicion your survival is still very much in jeopardy.

---

## The Tadpole Discussion

**Gale:** Back on the ship, you too were on the receiving end of a rather unwelcome insertion in the ocular region, were you not?

**Player:** Go on...

**Gale:** And yet, if we indulge in the hypothetical for a moment...

**Gale:** The insertee we speak of, this parasite - are you aware that after a period of excruciating gestation it will turn us into mind flayers? *(If player is not githyanki)*

**Gale:** As a githyanki, it's no news to you that this parasite will soon turn us into mind flayers - an outcome I'd rather like to avoid. *(If player is githyanki)*

**Gale:** It's a process known as ceremorphosis, and let me assure you: it is to be avoided.

**Gale:** You don't happen to be a cleric, by any chance, do you? A doctor? Surgeon? Uncannily adroit with a knitting needle?

---

### With Shadowheart present:

**Shadowheart:** You seem to know enough about our condition to realise it is beyond most clerics' skills.

**Gale:** Most, no doubt. But I find myself hoping to be in the presence of the few. You don't happen to be one of them?

**Player:** I was going to ask you the same question.

**Gale:** Then it looks like we're both starved for answers.

---

### Various class-specific responses:

**Player:** I'm a cleric indeed, but I'm afraid the power to remove this parasite eludes me. I can't cure us. *(Cleric)*

**Player:** I can tend to basic wounds and ailments, but alien parasites? I'm afraid not. *(Bard/Druid/Paladin/Ranger)*

**Player:** My hands are better suited to less delicate pursuits. I can offer you a swift end, but I can't cure you. *(Barbarian/Fighter)*

**Player:** My patron offers me many gifts, but tadpole extraction is not one of them. I can't cure our parasites. *(Warlock)*

**Player:** I possess many gifts, but tadpole extraction is not one of them. I can't cure our parasites. *(Sorcerer)*

**Player:** I'm no stranger to high-stakes extractions, but these tadpoles are beyond even my light fingers. I can't cure us. *(Rogue)*

**Player:** These tadpoles are beyond even my arcane knowledge. I cannot remove them. *(Wizard)*

**Gale:** I suppose few enough can. It's not exactly a common affliction.

---

## The Offer to Travel Together

**Gale:** We're most certainly going to need a healer, and soon too. How about we lend each other a helping hand once more and look for a healer together?

**Player:** Sounds like a plan. You're welcome to join me.

**Gale:** Most excellent. A parasite shared is a parasite halved. Or something to that effect.

**Gale:** Oh! But before you think you're about to embark on a journey with most ill-mannered a man: thank you for pulling me out of that stone.

**Gale:** It was an act of foresighted kindness I assure you, for I have the feeling ample opportunities will present themselves for me to return the favour.

---

## Alternative: Declining to recruit

**Player:** No, thank you. I'm not looking for another travelling companion.

**Gale:** Are you certain? There might be danger around the next corner, and a wizard is excellent company to keep.

**Player:** I'm certain.

**Gale:** Your quite significant loss. Farewell then, and good luck.

---

## Alternative: Drawing a weapon

**Player:** *You don't trust this man. Draw your weapon.*

**Gale:** Whoa - easy does it. You really, *really* don't want to do that. Not a threat, just an observation.

**Player:** *Sheathe your weapon.*

**Gale:** Much obliged. Besides, I suspect the real villain here is one we have in common.

*(Continues to tadpole discussion)*

---

## Alternative: Questioning his magic skills

**Player:** At introductions?

**Gale:** At magic. *(wistfully glances behind him at the waypoint, thinking on how close a scrape it was. Foreshadowing of him mourning his former magical skills.)*

---

## If player leaves him to his fate:

**Player:** *This is more trouble than it's worth. Leave him to his fate.*

**Gale:** No! I can't make it out by myself. I'll perish in here!

**Gale:** I'll perish...! *(The hand disappears into the sparkles and the sigil becomes dormant. A cry of 'I'll perish!' echoes several times, sounding increasingly far away, like an echo. Then silence.)*
