---

**Narrator:** *(Gale holds out his arm. Above the palm of his hand is conjured in gold-coloured magic the image of a woman, the goddess Mystra. He's looking at the figure intensely.)*

**Gale:** Oh! My, you startled me. I... I was miles away. *(Startled, he dispels it. Gale is looking at a miniature magical projection of Mystra he's created in his hand. Startled, he dispels it.)*

**Gale:** Of course, of course. I was just... practising an incantation. *(A bit embarrassed.)*

**Gale:** I do - because it's through practice that I seek to perfect. To augment.

**Gale:** She does. She's... She's Mystra. *(He says the name with reverence. She's his muse, his love, his passion.)*

**Gale:** I can't quite describe it, the need I sometimes feel to see her - to draw the filaments of fantasy into existence. *(Passionate.)*

**Gale:** No sculpture or painting could ever do her justice, only the fabric that she herself is and embodies: *(Passionate.)*

**Gale:** The Weave. *(Passionate.)*

**Gale:** Mystra is all magic. And as far as I'm concerned, she is all creation. *(Passionate.)*

**Gale:** It is a kind of love after all; at the very least a most deep seated passion.

**Gale:** Magic is... my life. I've been in touch with the Weave for as long as I can remember. There's nothing like it. *(Passionate.)*

**Gale:** It's like music, poetry, physical beauty all rolled into one and given expression through the senses. *(Passionate.)*

**Gale:** Would you like to experience this? *(For spellcasters: Wizard, Sorcerer, Bard)*

**Gale:** Then follow my lead.

**Narrator:** *(Gale walks around behind the player - as though teaching them to fly a kite - and makes a delicate gesture with both hands.)*

**Gale:** Now you.

**Narrator:** *(The player imitates the gesture. There's a first visual effect. Some sparks of magic start to appear around the player and Gale.)*

**Narrator:** *A familiar feeling - like a kind word and a kind touch at the same time. It's warm and comfortable.* *(For experienced spellcasters)*

**Narrator:** *You feel something strange - like a kind word and a kind touch at the same time. It's warm and comfortable.*

**Gale:** Excellent. Now repeat after me: *Ah-Thran Mystra-Ryl Kantrach-Ao*. *(The line can be read just like the words appear, but with some mystical gravitas in the pronunciation.)*

**Narrator:** *(The visual effect intensifies. There's the start of a glow, of a rush of beautiful magic.)*

**Narrator:** *Ah, yes: the scent of rosewater and a sense of wellbeing. A sliver of Weave that tastes sweet on the tongue.* *(For experienced spellcasters)*

**Narrator:** *Suddenly: the scent of rosewater and a sense of wellbeing. A sliver of Weave that tastes sweet on the tongue.*

**Gale:** Very good. Now I want you to picture in your mind the concept of harmony. As true as you can.

**Narrator:** *(The player and Gale are now fully enveloped in a magic glow - a protective field of beautiful magic. Unconsciously the player steps back closer to Gale.)*

**Narrator:** *You see - or is it sense? - the unmistakable presence of Mystra, the Lady of Mysteries.*

**Narrator:** *There's something like the anticipation of a kiss, then the pleasure of being cloaked in peace.*

**Narrator:** *You are safe. You are nestled in the cup of Mystra's hand.* *(If player knows Mystra)*

**Narrator:** *You are safe. You are nestled in the cup of her hand.*

**Gale:** You did it. You're channelling the Weave. How does it feel? *(Happy – yet with reverence.)*

**Gale:** Magical. Sensual, even.

**Gale:** That it does. *(Warmly.)*

**Narrator:** *The Weave connects you. The moment feels intimate.*

**Narrator:** *You realise the Weave is making you one. You have but to imagine your desire, and Gale will know it.* *(The magic glow is at its peak. It makes the player and Gale look like the only people in the world, safe in their own miniature dimension.)*

## Romantic Path: Imagining a Kiss
---

**Narrator:** *(Player pictures kissing Gale. With tenderness. Then, with passion.)*

**Gale:** I... I didn't think...

**Narrator:** *You perceive quick-fire gusts of embarrassment, trepidation, and finally... elation.*

**Gale:** Sorry, I wasn't expecting... But it is a pleasant image to be sure! *(Warm, with real affection.)*

**Gale:** Most pleasant, in fact. Most welcome. *(Warm, with real affection.)*

**Narrator:** *The Weave evaporates, and as it does so, you realise the night feels suddenly cold and lonesome.* *(All that beautiful magic slips away, and as it does, the player and Gale find themselves in the here and now again.)*

**Gale:** There it goes. How easily things slip away from us, no matter how hard they were in the obtaining. *(The weave disappears – he says this with a passionate melancholy.)*

**Gale:** Good night. I enjoyed sharing a moment of magic with you. *(Warm, with real affection.)*

---

## Alternative: Imagining a Romantic Walk
---

**Narrator:** *(Player pictures a romantic walk, hand slipped within Gale's.)*

**Gale:** I... I didn't think...

**Narrator:** *You perceive quick-fire gusts of embarrassment, trepidation, and finally... elation.*

**Gale:** Sorry, I wasn't expecting... But it is a pleasant image to be sure! *(Warm, with real affection.)*

**Gale:** Most pleasant, in fact. Most welcome. *(Warm, with real affection.)*

*(Continues as above)*

---

## Alternative: Imagining Friendship
---

**Narrator:** *(Player pictures a hearty meal with Gale, food and friendship flowing between them.)*

**Narrator:** *The Weave evaporates, and as it does so, you realise the night feels suddenly cold and lonesome.*

**Gale:** There it goes. How easily things slip away from us, no matter how hard they were in the obtaining. *(The weave disappears – he says this with a passionate melancholy.)*

**Gale:** Good night. I enjoyed sharing a moment of magic with you. *(Warm, with real affection.)*

---

## Alternative: Different Responses to the Experience
---

**Gale:** Effortless. You're a wonderful teacher.

**Gale:** I know. *(With Han Solo swagger.)*

---

**Gale:** Incredible. Though of course, I could have managed it by myself... *(Wizard/Sorcerer/Bard response)*

**Gale:** You're hard to please, aren't you? *(Said with a smile.)*

---

**Gale:** It's not quite like praying to her. She feels closer, somehow. *(Cleric of Mystra response)*

**Gale:** Quite so. The Weave is a sensitive conduit.

---

## Alternative: Hostile Images (Not Recommended)
---

**Narrator:** *(Player pictures kicking him in the gut.)*

**Gale:** That was... unnecessary. *(Gale and the player are bonded by the Weave, allowing the player to conjure an image in Gale's head that projects your feelings towards him. In this node, the player pictured hitting him in the stomach, which he does not quite appreciate.)*

**Narrator:** *The Weave evaporates, and as it does so, you realise the night feels suddenly cold and lonesome.*

**Gale:** There it goes. I suppose a blow to the stomach upsets the Weave as much as it would me. *(Moody.)*

**Gale:** I'm going to bed. Perhaps this was all a mistake. *(Angered and dismissive.)*

---

## Alternative: Failed Attempts
---

**Gale:** Not quite. But this is the easy part. Shall we try again?

**Gale:** No, I'm sorry, but it looks like magic's not on the cards tonight. Perhaps I'm not quite the teacher I fancy myself to be. *(The player failed to perform the necessary steps involved in spell casting. You really wanted the player to succeed, but alas.)*

**Gale:** In any case, don't blame yourself. Mystra can be a fickle mistress. Coy to a tee.

---

## Alternative: Player Declines to Continue
---

**Gale:** I'll leave you to it then. Good night.

**Gale:** Good night. Yes. Good night. *(Distracted. Still miles away in his head.)*

---

**Gale:** I think it's a mistake to give up so easily, but I cannot force your hand. *(Disappointed.)*
