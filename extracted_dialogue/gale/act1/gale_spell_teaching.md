**Narrator:** *(Gale holds out his arm. Above the palm of his hand is conjured in gold-coloured magic the image of a woman, the goddess Mystra. He's looking at the figure intensely.)*

**Gale:** Oh! My, you startled me. I... I was miles away. *(Startled, he dispels it. Gale is looking at a miniature magical projection of Mystra he's created in his hand. Startled, he dispels it.)*

**Gale:** Of course, of course. I was just... practising an incantation. *(A bit embarrassed.)*

**Gale:** I do - because it's through practice that I seek to perfect. To augment.

**Gale:** She does. She's... She's Mystra. *(He says the name with reverence. She's his muse, his love, his passion.)*

**Gale:** I can't quite describe it, the need I sometimes feel to see her - to draw the filaments of fantasy into existence. *(Passionate.)*

**Gale:** No sculpture or painting could ever do her justice, only the fabric that she herself is and embodies: *(Passionate.)*

**Gale:** The Weave. *(Passionate.)*

**Gale:** Mystra is all magic. And as far as I'm concerned, she is all creation. *(Passionate.)*

**Gale:** It is a kind of love after all; at the very least a most deep seated passion.

**Gale:** Magic is... my life. I've been in touch with the Weave for as long as I can remember. There's nothing like it. *(Passionate.)*

**Gale:** It's like music, poetry, physical beauty all rolled into one and given expression through the senses. *(Passionate.)*

**Gale:** Would you like to experience this? *(For spellcasters: Wizard, Sorcerer, Bard)*

**Gale:** Then follow my lead.

**Narrator:** *(Gale walks around behind the player - as though teaching them to fly a kite - and makes a delicate gesture with both hands.)*

**Gale:** Now you.

**Narrator:** *(The player imitates the gesture. There's a first visual effect. Some sparks of magic start to appear around the player and Gale.)*

**Narrator:** *A familiar feeling - like a kind word and a kind touch at the same time. It's warm and comfortable.* *(For experienced spellcasters)*

**Narrator:** *You feel something strange - like a kind word and a kind touch at the same time. It's warm and comfortable.*

**Gale:** Excellent. Now repeat after me: *Ah-Thran Mystra-Ryl Kantrach-Ao*. *(The line can be read just like the words appear, but with some mystical gravitas in the pronunciation.)*

**Narrator:** *(The visual effect intensifies. There's the start of a glow, of a rush of beautiful magic.)*

**Narrator:** *Ah, yes: the scent of rosewater and a sense of wellbeing. A sliver of Weave that tastes sweet on the tongue.* *(For experienced spellcasters)*

**Narrator:** *Suddenly: the scent of rosewater and a sense of wellbeing. A sliver of Weave that tastes sweet on the tongue.*

**Gale:** Very good. Now I want you to picture in your mind the concept of harmony. As true as you can.

**Narrator:** *(The player and Gale are now fully enveloped in a magic glow - a protective field of beautiful magic. Unconsciously the player steps back closer to Gale.)*

**Narrator:** *You see - or is it sense? - the unmistakable presence of Mystra, the Lady of Mysteries.*

**Narrator:** *There's something like the anticipation of a kiss, then the pleasure of being cloaked in peace.*

**Narrator:** *You are safe. You are nestled in the cup of Mystra's hand.* *(If player knows Mystra)*

**Narrator:** *You are safe. You are nestled in the cup of her hand.*

**Gale:** You did it. You're channelling the Weave. How does it feel? *(Happy – yet with reverence.)*

**Gale:** Magical. Sensual, even.

**Gale:** That it does. *(Warmly.)*

**Narrator:** *The Weave connects you. The moment feels intimate.*

**Narrator:** *You realise the Weave is making you one. You have but to imagine your desire, and Gale will know it.* *(The magic glow is at its peak. It makes the player and Gale look like the only people in the world, safe in their own miniature dimension.)*

**Narrator:** *(Player pictures kissing Gale. With tenderness. Then, with passion.)*
or
**Narrator:** *(Player pictures a romantic walk, hand slipped within Gale's.)*

**Gale:** I... I didn't think...

**Narrator:** *You perceive quick-fire gusts of embarrassment, trepidation, and finally... elation.*

**Gale:** Sorry, I wasn't expecting... But it is a pleasant image to be sure! *(Warm, with real affection.)*

**Gale:** Most pleasant, in fact. Most welcome. *(Warm, with real affection.)*

**Narrator:** *The Weave evaporates, and as it does so, you realise the night feels suddenly cold and lonesome.*

**Gale:** There it goes. How easily things slip away from us, no matter how hard they were in the obtaining. *(The weave disappears – he says this with a passionate melancholy.)*

**Gale:** Good night. I enjoyed sharing a moment of magic with you. *(Warm, with real affection.)*
