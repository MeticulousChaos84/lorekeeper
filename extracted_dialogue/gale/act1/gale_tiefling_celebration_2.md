---

**Gale:** Thank you. *(Looks at the player with a big smile and the words are warm and heartfelt)*

**Gale:** There's that confidence I like.

**Gale:** I thank you for seeking me out. Amid all this merriment I wasn't sure we'd have a chance to speak this evening.

## Path: Insufficient Bond

*If approval is below 35 or player already has a partner with another companion:*

**Gale:** Were our bond a little stronger, I might even have shared a moment of magic with you.

**Gale:** Alas, our fledgling acquaintanceship has not yet taken flight. Such intimacy will have to wait.

**Gale:** Another night perhaps.

---

## Path: The Magical Lesson

*If approval is 35 or higher and player has no other partner:*

**Gale:** I was hoping you'd spare me a moment. There was something rather magical I wished to show you.

**Gale:** A lesson. And trust me when I say - few have experienced the pleasure I offer to teach. *(Referring to the spell-teaching scene, but the player doesn't know the specifics. This should sound enticing without sounding creepy)*

**Gale:** However, it's something best experienced in more intimate surrounds, once the revelry has ended, and the stillness of the night has been restored.

**Gale:** For now - please, enjoy the celebration. When it is done, I will show you all.

### Alternative: Questioning the Wine

**Gale:** As they say in Waterdeep: in wine there is truth.

**Gale:** That's usually followed by: in water there is good sense.

**Gale:** I promise you - my offer is a perfectly sober one. So, what do you say?

### Alternative: Declining the Offer

**Gale:** Too bad. One should never be afraid to live life to the fullest. *(-2 approval)*

## Path: Player Chose Another Companion

*If player has already agreed to spend the night with another companion:*

**Gale:** I was hoping you'd spare me a moment. There was something rather magical I wished to show you.

**Gale:** More's the pity you've already found someone else to make merry with, just the two of you.

### If Partner is Astarion

**Gale:** He has a certain charm about him, Astarion. Then again, so does a tiger when it purrs.

### If Partner is Karlach

**Gale:** You might be in for an adventure with Karlach. More than you bargained for - with a bit of luck.

**Gale:** Or perhaps more than you bargained for - full stop.

### If Partner is Lae'zel

**Gale:** Lae'zel. Blade like a razor, wit like a razor, tongue like a razor.

**Gale:** I do hope you know what you're doing.

### If Partner is Shadowheart

**Gale:** There's something... unspeakable about Shadowheart. But I mean that in a good way. She seems to me like a bud on the cusp of bursting into a rose.

**Gale:** That or deadly nightshade.

### If Partner is Wyll

**Gale:** Wyll's a good man. He may actually be a tried-and-true storybook hero.

**Gale:** Then again he's so full of himself it's a small miracle he hasn't resorted to self-cannibalism yet.

### Continuing the Conversation

**Gale:** Far be it from me of course, to question your tastes.

#### Alternative: What Were You Going to Show Me?

**Gale:** That, my friend, must remain a secret. For now. Or rather: for as long as you've eyes only for someone else among our troupe.

**Gale:** Another night perhaps.

#### Alternative: You Question Them Nonetheless / Jealousy / Sore Loser

**Gale:** Caught on to that, did you? Might be the wine talking. *(or)* Jealousy is in the eye of the beholder. Or something along those lines, the wine might be befuddling me a smidge. *(or)* Am I? Perhaps I am. Or perhaps I need another glass of wine.

*If approval is 35 or higher:*

**Gale:** The point is - I have hope. Each new sunrise may yet be the one to coax our budding bond to blossom. But I think it's fair to say - it won't be today's.

**Gale:** Now please, go and enjoy your evening. This won't be the first party I've spent moping in self-indulgence with a bottle of wine for company.

*If approval is below 35, the conversation branches to the wine saying:*

**Gale:** As they say in Waterdeep: in wine there is truth.

**Gale:** That's usually followed by: in water there is good sense.

#### Alternative: Changing Mind About Partner Choice

*If player decides to spend the night with Gale instead of their chosen companion:*

**Gale:** Indeed?

*If approval is below 35:*

**Gale:** You're all too quick to abandon the one you promised yourself to. That is not a quality I admire.

*If approval is 35 or higher:*

**Gale:** I'm glad you feel the same way. But, while I'm eager to enjoy your company on an exclusive basis later this evening, it would be selfish to keep you to myself before then.

**Gale:** So please - go, and enjoy the festivities. Anticipation will only make our reunion the sweeter.

## Alternative Opening: Spontaneous Gratitude

**Gale:** Thank you. *(Looks at the player with a big smile and the words are warm and heartfelt)*

**Gale:** I'm glad you sought me out. Amid all this merriment I wasn't sure we'd have a chance to speak this evening. *(or)* Come now! This is a night for celebration, not suspicion. I'm glad you sought me out. Amid all this merriment I wasn't sure we'd have a chance to speak this evening.

*(Conversation continues to main paths above)*
