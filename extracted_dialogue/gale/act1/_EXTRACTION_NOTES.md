## Files Not Extracted

### Gale_InParty2_Nested_TopicalGreetings.html
**Status:** File too large to process (73,511 tokens)
**Reason:** Exceeds the maximum readable token limit even with pagination
**Content:** Likely contains many contextual greetings and reactive dialogues based on game state
**Recommendation:** Would require specialized extraction using grep to find SORCERER/WILD_SORCERER/REALLY_GALE tagged content, or manual processing in smaller chunks

### Gale_InParty2_Nested_ShadowheartShar.html
**Status:** Skipped (companion interaction)
**Reason:** This is Shadowheart revealing she's a Sharran to Gale, not Gale-focused content
**Content:** Companion-to-companion interaction dialogue

### Gale_InParty2_Nested_AstarionReveal.html
**Status:** Skipped (companion interaction)
**Reason:** This is Gale discovering/reacting to Astarion being a vampire, primarily companion interaction
**Content:** While it shows Gale's personality, it's more about Astarion's reveal than Gale's character development

## Extraction Methodology Applied

All extracted files follow these principles:
- **Narrative flow over technical structure** - Player questions are implied in Gale's flowing responses
- **SORCERER/WILD_SORCERER/REALLY_GALE only** - No class/race-specific player dialogue unless it's Wild Sorcerer Tav
- **High approval, redemptive paths only** - No hostile interactions, low approval responses, or God Gale paths
- **Meaningful alternatives** - Multiple dialogue paths combined when they lead to the same outcome

---

## Act Classification

All extracted dialogues are classified as **Act 1** because:
- They occur during the InParty2 phase (post-recruitment, pre-major Act 2 events)
- They represent Gale's early relationship building and backstory reveal
- The orb crisis is still in its early stages (first/second item consumption)
