# Gale Romance - Morning After (Post-Game)

**Source File:** `END_GameFinale_RomanceFates_Gale.html`

**Context:** Gale and his romanced partner wake up in an inn bedroom the morning after saving the world. They discuss what comes next - whether to return to Waterdeep together, the state of the orb, and potentially marriage.

---

## Opening - Waking Together

**Gale:** It's curious. After all the wonders and monstrosities we've witnessed, waking beside you seems more unreal than any of it.

*[wistful/peaceful - spent a romantic night with the person he loves]*

I'd forgotten what it felt like, to greet a sunrise without fear of it being my last.

## If Gale Gave Crown to Mystra

**Gale:** Soon, I'll deliver the crown to Mystra, and be rid of the orb at long last. I'll be free.

**Player:** And what does freedom mean, for Gale of Waterdeep?

**Gale:** Oh, him. I've been thinking a lot about that. 'Gale of Waterdeep', sounds a bit... pompous, don't you think?

---

## If Orb Remains (But Dormant)

**Player:** You seem very relaxed. The orb isn't on the verge of exploding yet then?

**Gale:** It's strange, but somehow I woke up this morning and realised the orb feels different. No clamour, no desperation, no *hunger*.

I hesitate to say it, but I think it's... satisfied. I'll need to keep a careful study of it, make sure it's not suddenly destabilised by proximity to a rogue pair of Netherese sandals or what have you, but I think it's dormant.

That's one worry I can leave behind me, at least.

*[hint of nerves, he's about to ask you to marry him...]*

### On What Caused It

**Player:** Was it Mystra's doing, do you think?

**Gale:** It could be. Or perhaps the orb's hunger was fuelled by my own, and my contentment influences it in much the same way.

That's how I feel with you - content. It's a rather unfamiliar feeling, but a pleasant one.

---

## The Proposal

**Gale:** I love you, more than I've ever loved anyone, mortal or immortal. And you've proven your love for me in more ways than even the greatest mathematicians would dare to count.

And that's why I'm asking - will you marry me?

*[nervous hope]*

### Acceptance Responses

**Player:** I accept. I'll marry you, Gale Dekarios.

**Gale:** You will? Oh, thank goodness for that.

*[melting with relief]*

Then I go where you go. Waterdeep wouldn't be home without you, anyway.

We'll need time to make the arrangements of course - the Dekarios clan is scattered far and wide, and you'll have invites of your own to send out, I'm sure.

**Player:** Free to come back to bed...

**Gale:** We have all the time in the world for that. But first, there's something I wanted to talk to you about.

**Player:** I'm excited to meet this new you.

**Gale:** I do feel like a new man. I was going to speak to you about that, as a matter of fact.

### If Preferring Not to Marry

**Player:** Our relationship is perfect as it is. But Waterdeep sounds like fun.

**Gale:** You can't blame a fellow for trying. If you're contented as we are, then so am I.

*[joking]*

That does lead me to a more pressing matter. Exactly how large is your library?

---

## Future Together

**Gale:** It's taken me long enough to find you. I'll be damned if I'm letting you go.

The day is young, and there are thousands more days ahead of us.

---

## If Player Wants to Stay in Baldur's Gate

**Gale:** I understand your purpose lies here, but I fear if I return to Waterdeep alone, my heart would remain here with you.

And so, if you're at all amenable to the idea, I thought I could, perhaps, stay. There might even be room for two Dekarioses in Baldur's Gate?

---

## If Player Breaks Up / Takes Own Path

**Player:** I'm sorry, Gale. You'll have to return to Waterdeep alone. I've my own path to follow.

**Gale:** I - understand. But know this: wherever your path leads you, Waterdeep's gates will always be open to you. My door, too.

Should you ever wish to find me again, you need only ask. I'll be waiting.

---

## If Player Became Mind Flayer

### On Marriage

**Player:** You'd really wish to marry me, in my present condition?

**Gale:** Your 'present condition' is that you're the one I love. And your current form is merely a reflection of the depths of your sacrifice. It only makes me love you more.

There will be some practicalities to iron out. The guest list, the venue, and we'll need to find a *very* open-minded cleric.

I promise we'll make it work, if you'll have me?

### If Player Regrets Transformation

**Player:** You're lucky. I wish my own condition were so easily cured.

**Gale:** Whatever for? I rather like this new you. In fact, your tentacular transformation has inspired me to make a little change of my own.

## Karlach-Specific Path

*[If romanced as Karlach with failing engine]*

**Gale:** Oh, hells. I'm sorry. Barely awake a moment and I've already put my foot in it.

*[kicking himself - he's accidentally rubbed salt in his partner's very sore wound]*

**Player:** Don't be. At least one of us will get the cure we were hoping for.

**Gale:** Come now - resignation doesn't suit you half as well as optimism. We'll find some other means of fixing up that infernal engine of yours.

When we get to Waterdeep, we'll search in my library. It's bound to contain the odd scroll on hellish thermodynamics. Or a spell that might diffuse the heat in such a way that - Ah. But I'm getting ahead of myself. Do you... that is, would you consider returning to Waterdeep with me?

*[a bit nervous to ask - this is Karlach, after all]*

### If Karlach Needs to Return to Avernus

**Player:** I'd love to, Gale, but I can't. My engine is done. Fully cooked.

**Gale:** I - I don't believe it. I *won't* believe it.

If you were to return to the hells - temporarily - it would buy us some time. I could put *something* together, a means of keeping you stable at least. Please, let me try.

*[trying to convince her, scared by what she's saying]*

**Player:** And hand myself to Zariel on a platter? No thanks.

Or

**Player:** I'm not going back, Gale. I can't.

**Gale:** What if... what if I went with you?

*[scared by his own suggestion]*

### Gale Offers to Go to Avernus

**Player:** I couldn't let you do that. You deserve better.

**Gale:** I deserve the chance to live my life with the raging inferno I love. If that means relocating to the hells, so be it. I've heard Avernus is quite lovely this time of year.

Besides, it would be quite something to study infernal magic in its natural environs. I say 'natural' in the loosest sense, of course.

### If Karlach Chooses Death

**Player:** No, Gale. Neither of us is going to that pit. It all ends here. Now. I just want to see the sky one last time.

**Gale:** If this is the end, then we face it together. That, at least, I can promise you.

*[heartbroken - his lover is dying next to him]*

### If Karlach Accepts

**Player:** If you were with me, I might be able to handle it.

**Gale:** There's *nothing* we can't handle - I promise you that.

*[putting a brave face on it so they can enjoy the time they have left]*

## Notes

This scene represents the culmination of Gale's romantic arc - from a man defined by his desperate need for Mystra's approval to someone who has found genuine contentment with a mortal partner. His observation that the orb may be "satisfied" because *he* is satisfied suggests a profound change in his understanding of desire and fulfillment.

The proposal itself is charmingly nervous - for all his verbosity and confidence, he's genuinely uncertain whether the player will accept. His willingness to follow the player anywhere (even to Avernus, even if they became a mind flayer) demonstrates that he's learned what love actually means: not grand gestures seeking approval, but showing up for someone no matter the circumstances.

The Karlach path is particularly poignant - Gale immediately offers to abandon Waterdeep and his entire life to go to the hells with her, showing how far he's come from the man who once needed a goddess's validation to feel worthy.
