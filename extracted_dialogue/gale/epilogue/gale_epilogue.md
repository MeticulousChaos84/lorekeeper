# Gale Epilogue Dialogue (Mortal Path)

**Source:** EPI_Epilogue_Gale.html

**Synopsis:** This dialogue covers Gale attending the Withers reunion party in his human (non-god) form. His default state is that he returned to Waterdeep and became a professor of Illusory magic at Blackstaff Academy. If not a teacher in Waterdeep, he could be in other locations (Baldur's Gate, Hells, Underdark) depending on where his romance partner chose to be.

## Partnered with Gale - Living in Waterdeep

### Initial Greeting (Married)

**Gale:** You're *quite* certain I look acceptable?

**Gale:** I can't remember when I last wore something other than my teaching robes. It feels a little odd to find myself in something so unsinged.

**Gale:** That's a relief. I wasn't sure if I'd made too much of an effort. Or perhaps, not enough...

**Tara:** If *only* you'd applied those efforts to that thing on your chin...

**Gale:** The day I shave this beard, Tara, is that day I shave you. For both of our sakes, I hope it never comes.

**Gale:** I won't keep you to myself for too long, but while I have you - I want to say thank you for encouraging me to attend this evening.

**Gale:** Teaching at Blackstaff Academy has proven such an unexpected pleasure. Sometimes I find it hard to tear myself away.

**Gale:** Just one of the myriad unexpected ways life has delighted me in recent months.

**Gale:** Even my own city feels new to me, now that I share it with you.

### Life in Waterdeep

**Gale:** That you do. I've not had so much fun in Waterdeep since my own days as a wayward Blackstaff apprentice.

**Gale:** You've certainly made quite the impression on my friends down at the Yawning Portal. The last I heard, they were thinking of naming a drink after you.

*Or:*

**Gale:** An impression I'm delighted the city has managed to redeem. As have I, I hope.

*Or (with Astarion partner):*

**Gale:** You've certainly exposed me to sides of Waterdeep I'd never had the pleasure of experiencing until now. If 'pleasure' is the word for such places...

*Or (with Shadowheart partner):*

**Gale:** As my mother always says, 'if you can't find yourself in Waterdeep, you're not looking in the right mirror.'

### Reflecting on Change

**Gale:** I'm just glad you're happy there. When we met, our lives were rather different, and being here this evening... well, it reminds me how much has changed.

**Gale:** When Mystra quelled the orb at last, she did more than rid me of its threat. She created room for hope, where once I felt only despair.

**Gale:** Standing here now I no longer see the people we were - frightened, desperate, alone. We changed. We survived. And we did it together.

**Gale:** I've missed them. I've missed *this*.

### On Missing Adventure

**Gale:** I wouldn't go *quite* that far. Living without the threat of imminent ceremorphosis seems infinitely preferable to life on the precipice of such a transformation.

**Gale:** As I told you long ago - it is to be avoided.

**Gale:** Gods knows, we suffered for our salvation, but it was worth it, wasn't it?

**Gale:** We did something *incredible*. And wherever life takes us - we'll carry the memory of that with us forever.

### Longing for Adventure

**Gale:** No, no, I prefer the warmth of my library's hearth these days. But the *feeling* of adventure... I confess - *that* I long for.

**Tara:** Now, Mr Dekarios, we've spoken about this. You really must find safer pastimes - for your own good, and mine too.

**Gale:** I have been dabbling with the idea of capturing our adventures with humble ink and parchment.

**Gale:** We've tales enough to fill a good few volumes, and when the truth runs out, who knows... My quill might take us on further adventures yet.

### Farewell at the Party

**Gale:** Now, much as I could spend an eternity in your company - we see plenty of each other already.

**Gale:** Tempting as it is to keep you all to myself, we'd be terrible company if we didn't mingle for at least part of the evening.

**Gale:** I love you.

**Gale:** Now go on, before I change my mind.

*Or:*

**Gale:** Enjoy yourself, my love. I'll be right here if you need me. Or else somewhere near the buffet...

## Partnered with Gale - Living in Avernus (with Karlach)

### Initial Greeting

**Gale:** Goodness me. Well this is a rather pleasant change of pace, isn't it?

**Gale:** You're certain we shouldn't have, you know, dressed up a bit?

**Gale:** I suppose we do have a certain singed sophistication to us, though I fear the fact we stink like rotten eggs shatters the illusion somewhat.

*Or:*

**Gale:** And of course you look resplendent in it. Positively glowing... though that may be your infernal engine making itself known.

**Gale:** Ignore me - I'm merely overwhelmed to feel Faerunian soil beneath my boots once more. To breathe air unsullied by the noxious breath of a pursuing cambion.

### On Life in Avernus

**Gale:** I confess, when I left Waterdeep there was a part of me afraid that I might regret my decision. But I never have.

**Gale:** Well, you know me. I'm always open to trying new things.

**Tara:** Unfortunately.

*Or:*

**Gale:** Oh, I don't know. There's a certain charm to the place, if you squint hard enough. And try not to breathe in.

**Tara:** I find a satchel of potpourri worn as an amulet does wonders.

**Gale:** I don't know where to begin in telling people what we've been up to. I suspect they won't believe me...

**Gale:** Now, you protest, but I'm certain I saw you lingering over a first edition of 'The Plane-Shifting Pit-Fiend.' A pity it was so flammable...

### On Returning to Faerun

**Gale:** Without you? Not a tressym in Hell's chance.

**Tara:** Why, I do just fine in the Hells, Mr Dekarios. A bit of heat in these old bones is quite the luxury.

**Gale:** Quite right. And we're delighted every time the catflap of displacement brings you to us.

**Gale:** No, fear not - I've no burning desire to return to this plane. Strange as it is to say, I'm feeling rather at home in Avernus.

**Gale:** And so long as I continue my studies on the finer points of infernal engineering, who knows - we might make a home in Waterdeep yet.

## Partnered with Gale - Living in Baldur's Gate

### On Life in Baldur's Gate

**Gale:** I confess, when I left Waterdeep there was a part of me afraid that I might regret my decision. But I never have.

**Gale:** The chance to see life through your eyes, as well as my own - it's been everything I hoped it would be.

**Gale:** I'm delighted to be here amongst friends again, but part of me is reluctant to step away from our new life - even for such a gathering as this.

**Gale:** I merely lacked the correct motivation, but even the City of Splendours itself fails to dazzle when set against your beauty.

*Or:*

**Gale:** Come now - our adventures have offered far more than the potential for destruction. I have enough looted literature to fill a dozen libraries.

*Or:*

**Gale:** 'Home.' How I love to share that word with you.

*Or:*

**Gale:** Oh, ignore me - I'm perfectly content. Besides, the chance to step out for a night on your arm is hardly one I'm going to pass up.

**Tara:** I'm just glad I'm not the only one encouraging you to leave the library once in a while. It does one good to feel the grass beneath one's paws from time to time.

### Rebuilding Baldur's Gate

**Gale:** *Ahem.* Well, the improvements I made to the High Hall alone should protect it from any passing Netherbrains for a millennia at least.

**Gale:** One can never have too many buttresses, after all.

**Gale:** Our lives are certainly a far cry from the one I once pictured. Even now, with the orb's fires quelled by Mystra at last, I scarcely dare believe it.

**Gale:** Before we met I fear I was rather stuck in my ways. And stuck inside my tower with a world-shattering orb of magic sealed within my chest, to be fair to myself.

**Gale:** I was afraid to so much as dream of a night like this. To hope that my life might amount to more than lonely, bitter disappointment. And then I found you.

## Partnered with Gale - Secret Relationship (Shar Shadowheart)

### Initial Greeting

**Gale:** I was hoping I'd see you here.

**Gale:** I confess, I wasn't *entirely* sure what to wear. Usually our meetings are a little more, er, *clandestine*, shall we say...

**Gale:** I know our time together is rather snatched, but I assure you - it's also savoured. You remain very precious to me, as does everyone.

---

## Not Partnered - Friend Greeting in Waterdeep

### Initial Greeting

**Gale:** Well well, look what the tressym dragged in...

**Gale:** Professor Gale Dekarios of Blackstaff Academy, educator of the esteemed School of Illusion. A pleasure to remake your acquaintance.

### Discussing the Orb's Cure

**Gale:** She did not, I'm delighted to report.

**Gale:** I surrendered the Crown of Karsus to her, as I told you I would. And in return, she cured me of the orb at last.

**Gale:** Even now, I struggle to put the feeling into words. It was like exhaling for the first time, after holding my breath for so very long.

*Or (if Crown not surrendered):*

**Gale:** She sought me out, not long after we went our separate ways, and assured me neither she nor the orb should pose me any threat in the future.

**Gale:** Of course, it's still in there. A constant reminder of my former hubris, and a surprisingly effective means of keeping my more disobedient students in line. Perhaps a tad too effective.

### On Teaching

**Gale:** Of course, I haven't clarified with my students that the orb is no longer a threat. The legend of my explosive capabilities is an excellent means of controlling a classroom. Too good, if anything.

**Gale:** I spend most of my time trying to convince them how much *fun* the study of magic can be, but it'd be easier to crack a smile on an intellect devourer than some of my pupils...

**Gale:** Well, that was quite lovely. I'm glad you're as pleased to see me as I am you.

**Gale:** I have to say, I'm quite grateful to just be 'Gale' for the evening.

**Gale:** I fear my students find me somewhat intimidating, due to my erm, *explosive* former reputation. I seem to put the fear of the gods into them.

**Gale:** Or the fear of Mystra, to be more specific.

### Why Illusory Magic

**Gale:** I did offer, as a matter of fact.

**Gale:** However, the Blackstaff insisted I couldn't teach every subject, nor could the simulacra of myself I offered to create for that purpose.

**Gale:** So, I've settled for teaching the art of illusion. Magic to confound the senses, to render the impossible into reality, and to allow expression of that most magical attribute of all - *imagination.*

*Or:*

**Gale:** Illusory magic has the power to confound the senses, to render the impossible into reality, and to allow expression of that most magical attribute of all - *imagination.*

### Reflecting on Growth

**Gale:** I did. But meeting you, travelling that strangest of roads together, I learned to see myself differently. See the Weave differently.

**Gale:** In fact, I've actually been considering writing down the story of our adventures. The true tale of our flawed but ultimately endearing troupe, and the trials and tribulations we overcame.

**Gale:** I can hardly leave it to the likes of Volo to give a true account of our adventures. And no one would believe him if he did.

**Tara:** That odious man truly frizzles my whiskers. 'Long-haired miniature dragon,' he calls me. 'Tressym' is much less of a mouthful.

### Asking About Player's Life

**Gale:** And what of you? What are you making of this new-found lease of life we earned?

**Gale:** It's strange to say it, but I've never been happier. This unexpected life of mine has turned out to be quite wonderful.

*Or:*

**Gale:** As am I. What a relief it was to set that particular burden down at last.

**Gale:** Of all the outcomes I might have expected from our journey, I confess - finding love wasn't one of them. But it so often lurks in the most unexpected of places.

### Farewell (Friend)

**Gale:** You were quite the travelling companion, my friend. I know our paths diverge from here, but should you ever desire a wizard to walk at your side - you know where to find me.

**Gale:** Excellent. I'll have my sturdiest magical boots at the ready.

*Or (with hug):*

**Gale:** It's good to see you again.

## Reuniting After Time Apart (Went to Hells/Astral/etc.)

### Initial Greeting

**Gale:** So, you came back.

**Gale:** In a manner of speaking, I suppose. You are a little more transparent than I remember.

*Or:*

**Gale:** You look well. A little singed around the edges, but well.

**Gale:** I wasn't sure I'd ever see you again. I'm not sure where to begin...

**Gale:** Yes, I think that about sums it up. Gods, I've missed you.

*Or:*

**Gale:** More than words can express. And I hope you feel the same.

### Catching Up

**Gale:** I promise I've not been moping around waiting for your return. Though, of course, I longed for it.

**Gale:** I've told my students plenty of tales about our escapades. You're something of a hero to them, you know.

### Invitations to Visit/Lecture

**Gale:** I'd be delighted to introduce you to my current cohort - as a guest lecturer, perhaps? I'm sure they'd have plenty of questions for you.

**Gale:** Excellent. I knew you wouldn't be able to resist the allure of sharing your expertise.

**Gale:** Of course you'll be most welcome to stay with me in my tower-

**Tara:** *Ahem.*

**Gale:** My apologies, Tara. That would be *our* tower.

*Or:*

**Gale:** I don't see why not - two heads are better than one. Unless you're dealing with an ettin...

**Gale:** It will give us plenty of time to catch up on your adventures.

**Gale:** I'm very curious to know what you've been up to these past months, but I suspect the telling of that tale would keep you tied to me all evening.

**Gale:** So, in the spirit of selflessness I encourage you to mix and mingle for now. We've time enough to come.

### Promise to Return (Ex-Partner)

**Gale:** I'd be delighted to introduce you to them when you return. That is, if you wish to return to Faerûn. Or to me...

**Gale:** I'm glad to hear that. And I promise - when that day comes, our home will be ready for you.

*Or:*

**Gale:** Then I offer you my word in exchange - I will wait for you, always.

**Gale:** *Zhak vo'n'fynh duj*.

*Or:*

**Gale:** Your caution is warranted, but believe me - I know enough of divination to promise you our future is one worth looking forward to.

**Gale:** A crackling hearth, two cosy armchairs beside it, a bottle of wine to be poured, and your battle-worn boots discarded at long last by the door.

**Gale:** That is the life we have waiting for us. Believe in it, and it will come.

### Declining to Return

**Gale:** I see. Then you truly aren't coming back?

**Gale:** Well, that makes this evening all the more special. A fond farewell for someone I am most, most fond of.

**Gale:** May your future adventures be as splendid as the ones we shared. I will treasure them - always.

## Ex-Partner Dialogue

### With Gale Now Partnered with Another

**Gale:** I must say, you're looking very well. I'd hazard a guess that life without a tadpole in your skull is rather suiting you.

**Gale:** And I'm glad you've found a love of your own. We both deserve that.

*Or:*

**Gale:** Thank you.

### Addressing the Past

**Gale:** Fear not. My heart has survived far crueller partings, and lived to tell the tale.

**Gale:** I assure you, I meant exactly what I said to you at the time. Perfect as they are, some things aren't made to last forever.

**Gale:** I feel quite certain that the bond of friendship between us will have far more longevity.

**Tara:** This is why Mrs Dekarios and I will be waiting an eternity more for grandchildren.

**Gale:** Psst! Shoo, Tara.

## Responses to Player Updates

### Player Finding Love

**Gale:** And I couldn't be happier for you. A fitting reward for the sacrifices you made in getting here.

### Player Life is Quiet

**Gale:** Quiet is not always peace - that much I can vouch for. But in your case - I think you deserve a moment's rest.

### Astarion Origin Updates

**Gale:** Still keeping those teeth sharp, I'll wager.

### Shadowheart - Shar Path

**Gale:** Impressive. I'm afraid news of your church's success hasn't yet reached my ears in Waterdeep, but where Shar's concerned, I suppose secrecy is rather the point.

### Shadowheart - Free from Shar

**Gale:** Sounds delightful. What a joy it must be to live so freely in the light at last.

### Shadowheart - Unfinished Business

**Gale:** Gotcha, gotcha. Your secrets are safe with me...

### Karlach in Avernus

**Gale:** I almost feel sorry for the devils in your path. I mean, I *don't*, of course. I'm sure they deserve it.

### Wyll - Blade/Duke

**Gale:** No harm keeping yourself busy. You've a reputation to maintain, after all.

### Lae'zel - Diplomatic Breakthrough

**Gale:** Well I never. Lae'zel of K'liir, astral warrior, champion of her people, a *diplomat*. Nothing wrong with a bit of character growth.

### Lae'zel - Fighting Vlaakith

**Gale:** Well, I for one can't think of anyone better equipped to survive the endless wrath of an all-powerful deity with an empire of violent and morally dubious astral warriors at her disposal.

### Dark Urge - Peaceful Life

**Gale:** *Really*? Well, I'm glad you've found a new profession, though best not to mention any previous neck-snapping inclinations, I imagine.

### Mind Flayer Player

**Gale:** Living life to the full, even as an illithid. Inspirational stuff.

### Generic Positive

**Gale:** From you, I'd expect nothing less.

## Spellteaching Callback

### Remembering the Lesson

**Gale:** Ah, so you still remember our little lesson?

**Gale:** As I recall, you had a very... active imagination, shall we say.

*Or:*

**Gale:** It was at that moment, the Weave connecting us, that I realised how much your friendship had come to mean to me. As it still does.

*Or:*

**Gale:** It was quite something to share such a moment with you, though it vanished all too quickly.

*Or:*

**Gale:** You were, of course, indulging me in submitting to such a lesson. 'Teaching' you was hardly an effort at all. Not like my present cohort of apprentices.

**Gale:** They try their best, of course - when they can manage to stay awake.

**Tara:** The cheek of them! Nothing a well-placed swipe from Tara can't fix, though.

---

## Brief/Return Dialogue

### Already Spoken

**Gale:** I know my charm is intoxicating, but let's not be poor company.

**Gale:** Go, have fun. I promise I'll stay out of trouble for one evening.

### Quick Return

**Gale:** I can't believe this is real. I never thought we'd gather like this again.

**Gale:** It's quite... *ahem*, yes really quite lovely.

### Simple Greeting

**Gale:** Marvellous party, isn't it?

---

## Tara Interactions

### On Gale's Appearance

**Tara:** No harm in taking pride in your appearance, Mr Dekarios. Though I do so *wish* you'd take more pride in that chin of yours.

### On Partner's Flirting

**Tara:** Oh, don't mind me. I'm only your oldest friend and your mother's most voluble confidant. Do whatever you please, I don't mind!

### On Mind Flayer Appearance

**Gale:** Sorry, my love. That was a little insensitive of me. And may I say - your tentacles are looking *wonderfully* moist this evening. No finer illithid ever walked the face of Faerûn.

---

## Various Response Lines

### On Class-Specific Compliments

**Gale:** What can I say? You're an *excellent* teacher.

**Gale:** I think that particular feat was your doing, but having a wizard with an aptitude for *excellently* timed counterspells beside you no doubt helped.

**Gale:** Not me, of course. Gale of Waterdeep might have craved such attention, but Gale Dekarios does a heroic deed purely for its own quiet satisfaction. And the occasional hearty 'thank you.'

### Declining Invitations

**Gale:** I totally understand. Perhaps our exploits might be a little on the mature side for my students, come to think of it...

**Gale:** Oh. Well, no matter. Dinner alone can be every bit as enjoyable as with company.

**Tara:** *Alone*? And what am I - a stuffed toy?

**Gale:** Please - enjoy the rest of your evening.

### Planning to Visit

**Gale:** Still, at the very least you must come visit me. I've a pantry full of Waterdhavian delicacies and a delightful bottle of Elverquisst with your name on them...

**Gale:** Say no more. There's a wizard in Blackstaff's anatomical department who owes me a favour, no questions asked. All diets will be catered for. I can hardly wait.

**Gale:** Excellent, excellent, excellent. I can hardly wait.

### On Coming to Hells/Astral

**Gale:** Perhaps I might come to you, then? I recently met the most excellent diabolist who should be able to lend a hand with the travel arrangements...

**Gale:** You just let me know which hill of burning sulphur to aim for, and I'll have popped through a portal before you can say 'Zariel'.

**Gale:** I suppose, if I were to open a contained portal in a particularly safe region of Avernus...

**Gale:** No. The Blackstaff would never allow it. Health and safety, you see - it's all the rage in wizardry these days.

*End of Extraction*
