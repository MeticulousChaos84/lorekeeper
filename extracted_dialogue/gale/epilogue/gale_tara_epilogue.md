## Gale Is Dead - Player Has Met Tara

**Tara:** Oh, hello, darling. I was hoping to see you. Withers informed me about this little get-together and I thought I'd show my whiskers. I wanted to see you again. I thought it was high time we had a proper catchup about... you know. Him.

### Conversation About Gale's Memory

**Tara:** In the weeks after he died, you can't imagine how dark things seemed. How I wished I'd never encouraged him to leave that house. And then there were all those nights I spent with his mother, consoling her, just... weeping.

**Tara:** But somewhere along the way, I found I could think about him - remember him - and *smile*, rather than cry. And now I dearly hope you and I might share a few stories about our adventures with Mr Dekarios.

**Tara:** That's good. We *should* miss him. He was such a lovely fellow. Proud as a peacock, but... my little love. Oh, what I wouldn't give to snuggle up on his lap one more time. Just once would do.

**Alternative: Offering comfort**

*If the player offers to let Tara snuggle in their lap:*

**Tara:** Oh, I couldn't possibly... unless... well, perhaps it's not a terrible idea. Gale would be quite pleased to know we've made friends, wouldn't he?

*[Player pets Tara]*

**Tara:** Perhaps you'd be willing to come meet Gale's mother, some time? She misses him so - and I know it would do her heart a world of good to discuss her son with someone who knew him as he was. Jolly good. I'll tell Mrs Dekarios to be expecting you. Oh, she'll be delighted. Things just haven't been the same without himself cluttering up the place.

**Tara:** Enjoy your party, dear. I've heard you quite deserve a celebration.

**Alternative: Acknowledging loss**

**Tara:** Ah, to lose the one you love the most. What a terrible thing.

**Tara:** No. Not in this life, at least.

**Alternative: Accepting reality**

**Tara:** I suppose we do. But I certainly wish we didn't.

## Gale Is Dead - Player Has Not Met Tara

**Tara:** Oh, right, you. Hello.

**Tara:** Yes, I'm certain it is. As for you, well, I've heard congratulations are in order. You helped Mr Dekarios save Baldur's Gate from the Absolute, isn't that right?

**Alternative: Gracious acceptance**

**Tara:** Well done. Despite my old friend's genius, he'd have blown himself up long ago if not for the help of friends like you and I. Yes. I'm sure you are.

**Alternative: Arguing credit**

**Tara:** That doesn't sound like him. But whichever way you want to remember it, well done, I suppose. Yes. I'm sure you are.

**Tara:** You ought to come visit myself and Gale when you're able. If you can extract yourself from what I'm sure are very important responsibilities.

*[Various responses about visiting, leading to:]*

**Tara:** We'll send word by pigeon when we've need of you. I used to have a taste for them, but a great many things have changed in recent months...

**Tara:** Ta-ta, darling.

---

## Player Not Partnered With Gale - Meeting Tara

**Tara:** Oh, right, you. Hello.

**Alternative: If player met Tara before**

**Tara:** Gale's friend Tara, right? It's good to see you again.

**Tara:** Yes, I'm certain it is. As for you, well, I've heard congratulations are in order. You helped Mr Dekarios save Baldur's Gate from the Absolute, isn't that right?

**Alternative: If player was Mind Flayer**

**Tara:** And you made significant sacrifices to your well-being, by the looks of things.

**Alternative: Responding about sacrifice**

**Tara:** Yes. I'm sure you are. You ought to come visit myself and Gale when you're able. If you can extract yourself from whatever responsibilities mind flayers might have or if you can extract yourself from what I'm sure are very important responsibilities.

**Tara:** We'll send word by pigeon when we've need of you. I used to have a taste for them, but a great many things have changed in recent months...

**Tara:** Ta-ta, darling.

**Alternative: Player is sassy**

*If player says "Pspspspsps":*

**Tara:** Something caught in your throat, dear? or Good heavens, dear. What the devil was *that?*

**Tara:** Anyway, I hear congratulations are in order.

**Alternative: If player mentions fireball incident**

*If player references when Tara fireballed them:*

**Tara:** Well, I had to check you were worthy of Gale's guardianship somehow. You passed, though by the breadth of a tressym's feather.

---

## Origin Gale - Returned to Waterdeep

**Tara:** Well, Mr Dekarios. Isn't this a familiar sight? I thought you'd got past this 'sleeping outdoors and getting smoke in your robes' phase, but here we are once again.

**Tara:** Would that that were so. But even with your recent penchant for good judgement, I can never be too cautious. As far as I'm concerned, you're always on the precipice of making your next terrible decision, sir. I won't be caught unawares again!

**Tara:** But I accept you've made friends among this rag-tag lot. So go on, bash your heads together or whatever it is you people like to do. When you're ready to leave, so am I.

**Alternative: Appreciative response**

**Tara:** You can thank me by not blundering into any more world-ending mischiefs for the next decade or three. Ta-ta.

**Alternative: Reassuring Tara**

**Tara:** Good. Your mother and I are going mushroom foraging in the morning. I'd hate to be too tired to suss the best pickings.

**Alternative: Playful banter about camping**

**Tara:** If I were capable of convincing you of anything, you'd have bid farewell to that scruff on your chin a long time ago.

**Alternative: Being contrary**

**Tara:** No, thank you.

---

## Origin Gale - Not in Waterdeep (Adventuring)

**Tara:** Well, Mr Dekarios. Here you are. Thought you'd have a night of revelry far from the loving supervision of your favourite tressym, did you?

**Tara:** Tara! I'm so glad to see you!

### If Gale Joined Lae'zel in Space

**Tara:** As you should be! All that time galavanting about space with nary so much as a letter for me or your poor mother!

**Alternative: Apologizing**

**Tara:** Is that so? It's very important, I'm sure. It's *always* something very important, isn't it, sir?

**Alternative: Reassuring**

**Tara:** Well, I'll have to take your word for that. It's quite impossible to inspect you for scratches, bruises, or errant orbs of magic while you're transparent, isn't it?

**Alternative: Promising to return**

**Tara:** *Hmph*. Well that will have to sate me for now. Your mother will be delighted to know she's in your thoughts, if not your correspondence.

### If Gale Is in Avernus with Karlach

**Tara:** Oh, really, sir. It can't be more than a week or two since I've visited. My catflap of displacement has barely ceased swinging before I poke my whiskers through once more. Still... I'm very glad to see you too.

**Tara:** I trust you're still very glad you chose to live in Hell rather than come home to me and your loving mother?

**Tara:** Yes, yes, ever the hero. I am so very proud of you, you know. Though I'd prefer to be ashamed of you home together in Waterdeep.

**Alternative: Joking response**

**Tara:** What else is a poor tressym to do when her favourite lap rest is so very far away?

**Alternative: Promising it's temporary**

**Tara:** A few years? Now I know you're lying to me. I look forward to the day you're safely home for good, but I won't be holding my breath. I'm not fool enough to believe we'll be rid of Avernus so soon.

### Discussing Why Tara Is at the Party

**Alternative: Asking about the invitation**

**Tara:** *I* am a personal confidante of Withers himself. He's joined myself and Mrs Dekarios for luncheon on more than one occasion. Our little trio has a great deal to talk about, what with all you get up to.

**Tara:** Still... I'm very glad to see you too.

**Alternative: Acknowledging Tara's vigilance**

**Tara:** Watchful indeed. Even with my catflap of displacement, it can be hard to put my paw on you sometimes. All these *adventures* you insist on having...

### Various Relationship Endings

**Alternative: If with Shadowheart**

*If player suggests Tara visit them and Shadowheart:*

**Tara:** *Mousers*? I'm going to pretend you didn't suggest that, sir. Else I might never forgive you.

**Alternative: If continuing space adventures**

**Tara:** Yes, yes, absolutely essential, I'm sure.

**Alternative: If with Halsin**

**Tara:** Yes, but *I'm* at my best all year round.

**Alternative: If being defensive**

**Tara:** You're just trying to be hurtful, now.

**Alternative: If asking if Tara came just to guilt trip**

**Tara:** That's not the *only* reason, but it was a primary aim, yes.

## Origin Gale - Generic Closer (Returned to Waterdeep)

**Tara:** You're here to speak with them, not me, Mr Dekarios. I'll indulge you in my company when we're safely back home.

---

## Origin Gale - Generic Closer (Not in Waterdeep)

**Tara:** Go on, shoo with you. I'm quite capable of keeping myself amused these days...

---

## Partnered with Gale

**Tara:** Oh, hello, darling. I wasn't sure you'd make it.

**Tara:** Are you? Withers and I have a regular correspondence. He's joined me and Mrs Dekarios for luncheon on more than one occasion. Of course we'd love to see yourself and Gale more often, but you keep him so very busy, and we hate to impose...

**Tara:** I suppose you do. All I ever wanted was for Gale to settle down, but now that he has... I miss him.

### Reassuring Tara

**Tara:** Yes, I am. And you're a dear for putting up with this cranky old tressym. I may show my claws now and then, but I hope I never scratch you too deeply.

**Tara:** Gale, on the other hand! The way he leaves his potions in absolute disarray - I know for certain he wasn't raised in a barn, but you'd never know it. We must begin our campaign to set him on the straight and narrow when we return home.

**Tara:** Now - enjoy your party. You've *quite* earned it, if the balladeers are to be believed.

### Alternative: Understanding but firm

**Tara:** Well! Then I'll just have to visit more often, won't I? My catflap of displacement wasn't invented to sit on the shelf.

**Tara:** Now - enjoy your party. You've *quite* earned it, if the balladeers are to be believed.

### Alternative: Being rude (Bad ending)

*If player says "Get over it, cat. The wizard's mine.":*

**Tara:** Call me 'cat' again, and see if you wake up with a trachea. You've made a powerful enemy today. Poor pet.

### If Living in Waterdeep Together

**Alternative: Inviting Tara for tea**

**Tara:** I'd like that very much. Thank you, darling.

**Tara:** Now - enjoy your party. You've *quite* earned it, if the balladeers are to be believed.

**Alternative: Reassuring about not taking Gale away**

**Tara:** I know that. But I *intensely* dislike sharing.

**Tara:** I suppose you do. All I ever wanted was for Gale to settle down, but now that he has... I miss him.

### If Not Living in Waterdeep

**Alternative: Inviting Tara to visit**

**Tara:** I'd like that very much. Thank you, darling.

**Alternative: Explaining the situation**

**Tara:** Who wouldn't? He's such a precious fellow. All I ever wanted was for Gale to settle down, but now that he has... I didn't expect it to be so hard.

### Alternative: Sarcastic about being social

**Tara:** Yes, you are a very social sort, aren't you? Gale's never been kept so busy in all his days. No wonder his studies are suffering. But! Such is the way of love, isn't it?

**Alternative: Asking what Tara is doing there (rude)**

**Tara:** *I* am a personal confidante of Withers himself. He's joined myself and Mrs Dekarios for luncheon on more than one occasion.

**Alternative: Telling Tara to leave**

*[Tara leaves]*

## Companion Gale - Generic Responses When Not God

### If Player and Companion Gale Saved Baldur's Gate Together

**Tara:** Well, there he is. Gale, in all his glory. I hope you're happy. 'The God of Ambition'. Have you ever heard anything more ridiculous?

**Tara:** Ambition, aspiration - greed and hubris is all I hear. The Gale I knew wasn't like this. He recognised his mistakes. He was contrite. All he wanted to do was *live.*

**Tara:** Unfortunately, he fell into company that turned his gaze toward foolishness. Yes, I mean *you.*

### Alternative: If player supported him becoming a god

**Tara:** Then you're just as mad as he.

**Tara:** I know there's nothing you could've done to stop him. Not really. Once he'd decided to learn nothing from his mistakes, what use were either of our protests?

### Alternative: If player wishes they'd stopped him

**Tara:** As do I. As do I.

**Tara:** I know there's nothing you could've done to stop him. Not really. Once he'd decided to learn nothing from his mistakes, what use were either of our protests?

### Alternative: If player deflects blame

**Tara:** But it would make everything so much easier.

**Tara:** I know there's nothing you could've done to stop him. Not really. Once he'd decided to learn nothing from his mistakes, what use were either of our protests?

### Alternative: If player insists Gale made his own choice

**Tara:** False. He was *mine*. Though now he belongs only to his own pride.

**Tara:** I know there's nothing you could've done to stop him. Not really. Once he'd decided to learn nothing from his mistakes, what use were either of our protests?

### Alternative: If player references fireball test

**Tara:** Well, I had to check you were worthy of Gale's guardianship somehow. You passed, though by the breadth of a tressym's feather.

**Tara:** I know there's nothing you could've done to stop him. Not really. Once he'd decided to learn nothing from his mistakes, what use were either of our protests?

### Invitation to Visit Mrs. Dekarios

**Tara:** Perhaps you'd be willing to come meet Gale's mother, some time? She misses him so - and I know it would do her heart a world of good to discuss her son with someone who knew him as he was.

**Alternative: If leaving Faerûn with Lae'zel**

**Tara:** Well if you ever come back do look us up in Waterdeep. Surname 'Dekarios'. I'd enjoy the chance to reminisce about the good man we knew.

**Tara:** Enjoy your party, dear. I've heard you quite deserve a celebration.

**Alternative: If leaving Faerûn with Karlach**

*[Same as Lae'zel response]*

**Alternative: Accepting invitation**

**Tara:** Jolly good. I'll tell Mrs Dekarios to be expecting you. Oh, she'll be delighted. Things just haven't been the same without himself cluttering up the place.

**Tara:** Enjoy your party, dear. I've heard you quite deserve a celebration.

**Alternative: Considering it**

**Tara:** See that you do. We'd love to have you. Things have been rather quiet without himself cluttering up the place.

**Tara:** Enjoy your party, dear. I've heard you quite deserve a celebration.

**Alternative: Declining**

**Tara:** Do give it some thought. If you change your mind, Mrs Dekarios and I will be only too delighted.

**Tara:** Enjoy your party, dear. I've heard you quite deserve a celebration.

## Additional Ending Variations

### If Partnered with Gale (but Gale died)

**Tara:** Now I know you didn't come all this way to see me. Go on - shoo with you.
