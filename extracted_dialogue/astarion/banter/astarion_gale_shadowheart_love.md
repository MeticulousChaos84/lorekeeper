# Party Banter: Astarion Gale Shadowheart Love

*Astarion asks Gale and Shadowheart if they have loves waiting for them on the other side of this. Gale obfuscates. Shadowheart responds.*

---

**Astarion:** So, do you have loves waiting for you once this is all over?

**Gale:** You know what - that is not the easiest of questions for me to answer.

**Shadowheart:** *You mean just waiting, like a lovesick puppy? Short-term amusements are much less hassle.*
