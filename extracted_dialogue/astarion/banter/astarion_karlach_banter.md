## Act 1

### Wilderness Forest

*Astarion and Karlach chat while wandering the forest.*

**Astarion:** Biting flies, midges - shouldn't nature be beautiful and serene? It looks so nice in the Upper City parks.

**Karlach:** Upper City, huh? Swish. Never spent much time there myself.

**Astarion:** I'll happily take you. If we survive this bugs' banquet.

**Karlach:** Sounds good. I've always been curious what a patriar loo looks like.

### Hag's Swamp

*Astarion and Karlach chat while wandering the swamp.*

**Astarion:** Transforming into a mind flayer might have its perks. At least then I could float over this muck.

**Karlach:** Not one for roughing it, I see.

**Astarion:** Wallowing in filth is for pigs and children, my dear.

**Karlach:** Pigs, children, and people with a little bit of grit.
