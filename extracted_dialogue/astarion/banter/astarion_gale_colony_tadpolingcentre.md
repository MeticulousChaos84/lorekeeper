# Party Banter: Astarion Gale Colony Tadpolingcentre

*Astarion and Gale discuss the Tadpoling Centre in Colony.*

---

**Astarion:** Gods - we're not back, are we?

**Gale:** On the nautiloid? No, this is a different nursery - similar, but not identical. There's likely one in every colony.

**Astarion:** I don't care what's in every mind flayer colony, Gale - nobody does. Except you.
