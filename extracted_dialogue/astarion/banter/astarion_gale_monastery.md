# Party Banter: Astarion Gale Monastery

*Astarion and Gale discuss the monastery*

---

**Astarion:** Another ruined temple, full of foul-smelling beasts, spoiling for a fight.

**Gale:** No mere temple. This was a monastery, devoted as much to study as to worship.

**Astarion:** Oh, how ignorant of me. So it'll be free of foul-smelling beasts, then?

**Gale:** Quite the opposite. Some monastic orders celebrated their pungency as proof of their devotion. 'To think is to stink' was the motto of one ill-fated brotherhood near Amn.

**Gale:** *Oh, but you meant beasts of the life-threatening variety? Yes, I'm sure it's teeming with those.*
