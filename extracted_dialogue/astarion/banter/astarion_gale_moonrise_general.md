# Party Banter: Astarion Gale Moonrise General

*Astarion and Gale discuss the Moonrise General.*

**Astarion:** Can't say I love what they've done with the place.

**Gale:** Unsurprising, really. Fanatical cultists tend to care more for ambience than aesthetics.

**Astarion:** Reason enough to put them all to the sword, I say.
