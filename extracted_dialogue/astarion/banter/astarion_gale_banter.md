# Astarion & Gale Banter

*Party banter between Astarion and Gale throughout the game.*

---

## Act 1

### Flirting

*Astarion tries to flirt with Gale. Gale reacts.*

**Astarion:** I am enjoying our walks together, aren't you, Gale?

**Gale:** Uhm... Sure. In silence.

---

### Hag's Illusion

*Astarion and Gale have seen the Hag's illusion disappear, revealing that the sweet forest they were walking through was actually a disgusting swamp. Astarion needles Gale, asking if he can do magic tricks like that.*

**Astarion:** From sweet woodland to stinking swamp. Can you do tricks like that, Gale?

**Gale:** Easiest thing in the world. Though I'd do it the other way around.

---

### Rosymorn Monastery

*Astarion and Gale discuss the monastery*

**Astarion:** Another ruined temple, full of foul-smelling beasts, spoiling for a fight.

**Gale:** No mere temple. This was a monastery, devoted as much to study as to worship.

**Astarion:** Oh, how ignorant of me. So it'll be free of foul-smelling beasts, then?

**Gale:** Quite the opposite. Some monastic orders celebrated their pungency as proof of their devotion. 'To think is to stink' was the motto of one ill-fated brotherhood near Amn.

**Gale:** *Oh, but you meant beasts of the life-threatening variety? Yes, I'm sure it's teeming with those.*

---

### The Orb

*Astarion wonders what happens to the orb once it's removed. He has some scores he'd like to settle.*

**Astarion:** That orb seems powerful. What can it do once it's extracted?

**Gale:** Nothing good can come of it unless it is contained. Why?

**Astarion:** It might be useful. Who knows?

---

### Romancing Tav

*Astarion teases Gale about his pining.*

**Astarion:** So Gale, how is your sad, hopeless pining going?

**Gale:** I'm hardly pining. It's been a year or more since Mystra cast me aside.

**Astarion:** Oh, my dear wizard. I wasn't talking about Mystra.

---

### Loves Waiting

*Astarion asks Gale and Shadowheart if they have loves waiting for them on the other side of this. Gale obfuscates. Shadowheart responds.*

**Astarion:** So, do you have loves waiting for you once this is all over?

**Gale:** You know what - that is not the easiest of questions for me to answer.

**Shadowheart:** *You mean just waiting, like a lovesick puppy? Short-term amusements are much less hassle.*

## Act 2

### Moonrise Bridge

*Astarion and Gale discuss arriving at the Moonrise Bridge.*

**Astarion:** Moonlanterns to keep the curse back, burly guards to fight off any monsters - I could get used to this place.

**Gale:** Don't get too comfortable. We shouldn't overstay our welcome in such a place.

**Astarion:** No, of course. Why stay somewhere safe and comfortable when we could be in mortal peril?

---

### Moonrise Towers

*Astarion and Gale discuss the interior of Moonrise.*

**Astarion:** Can't say I love what they've done with the place.

**Gale:** Unsurprising, really. Fanatical cultists tend to care more for ambience than aesthetics.

**Astarion:** Reason enough to put them all to the sword, I say.

---

### Rebel Hideout

*Astarion and Gale discuss the Rebel Hideout beneath the Mason's Guild*

**Astarion:** What's this? A clever little hideaway?

**Gale:** Not just clever - rather ingenious. Somehow its construction keeps the Shadow Curse at bay.

**Astarion:** A little too clever, if you ask me. Watch out for traps.

---

### Mind Flayer Colony - General

*Astarion and Gale discuss the Colony.*

**Astarion:** It's enough to put you off tentacles for life.

**Gale:** You had a taste for tentacles?

**Astarion:** The Elfsong Tavern used to serve excellent calamari. Mind you, that was two hundred years ago...

---

### Mind Flayer Colony - Tadpoling Centre

*Astarion and Gale discuss the Tadpoling Centre in the Colony.*

**Astarion:** Gods - we're not back, are we?

**Gale:** On the nautiloid? No, this is a different nursery - similar, but not identical. There's likely one in every colony.

**Astarion:** I don't care what's in every mind flayer colony, Gale - nobody does. Except you.

---

### Gale's Night with Tav

*Astarion teases Tav after their night with Gale.*

**Astarion:** So, how was your night with Gale? Did you have a long, hard debate?

**Gale:** Ignore him. Astarion envies the depth of our bond because he's of a shallower inclination.

**Astarion:** *Snort.*

---

## Act 3

### Baldur's Gate Sewers

*Astarion and Gale discuss returning to Baldur's Gate.*

**Astarion:** I gave my return to Baldur's Gate a lot of thought. I never pictured this, though.

**Gale:** What did you have in mind? A quiet party, toasting your return with a few good friends?

**Astarion:** Less 'quiet party with friends', more 'days of hedonistic debauchery'. But otherwise, yes.

**Gale:** Sounds like a recipe for disaster. But you know what? I'm learning to enjoy the taste of chaos. Count me in.

---

### Mystra

*Astarion tries to goad some details about sleeping with the goddess Mystra from Gale*

**Astarion:** *So, Gale - you laid with a goddess? You must have some sordid tales to tell?*

**Gale:** *Sordid? I lay with the Mother of Magic herself. What we had was transcendent, euphoric, incandescent. Not sordid.*

**Astarion:** You actually made sleeping with a goddess sound boring. Incredible...
