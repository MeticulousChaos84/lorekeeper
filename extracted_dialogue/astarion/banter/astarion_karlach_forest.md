# Party Banter: Astarion Karlach Forest

*Astarion and Karlach chat while wandering FOR*

**Astarion:** Biting flies, midges - shouldn't nature be beautiful and serene? It looks so nice in the Upper City parks.

**Karlach:** Upper City, huh? Swish. Never spent much time there myself.

**Astarion:** I'll happily take you. If we survive this bugs' banquet.

**Karlach:** Sounds good. I've always been curious what a patriar loo looks like.
