# Party Banter: Astarion Gale Generalsewers

*Astarion and Gale discuss the General Sewers.*

---

**Astarion:** I gave my return to Baldur's Gate a lot of thought. I never pictured this, though.

**Gale:** What did you have in mind? A quiet party, toasting your return with a few good friends?

**Astarion:** Less 'quiet party with friends', more 'days of hedonistic debauchery'. But otherwise, yes.

**Gale:** Sounds like a recipe for disaster. But you know what? I'm learning to enjoy the taste of chaos. Count me in.
