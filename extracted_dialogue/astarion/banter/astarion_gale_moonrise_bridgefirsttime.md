# Party Banter: Astarion Gale Moonrise Bridgefirsttime

*Astarion and Gale discuss the Moonrise Bridge.*

---

**Astarion:** Moonlanterns to keep the curse back, burly guards to fight off any monsters - I could get used to this place.

**Gale:** Don't get too comfortable. We shouldn't overstay our welcome in such a place.

**Astarion:** No, of course. Why stay somewhere safe and comfortable when we could be in mortal peril?
