# Party Banter: Astarion Gale Rebelhideout

*Astarion and Gale discuss the Rebel Hideout beneath the Mason's Guild*

---

**Astarion:** What's this? A clever little hideaway?

**Gale:** Not just clever - rather ingenious. Somehow its construction keeps the Shadow Curse at bay.

**Astarion:** A little too clever, if you ask me. Watch out for traps.
