# Party Banter: Astarion Karlach Hagswamp

*Astarion and Karlach chat while wandering FOR*

**Astarion:** Transforming into a mind flayer might have its perks. At least then I could float over this muck.

**Karlach:** Not one for roughing it, I see.

**Astarion:** Wallowing in filth is for pigs and children, my dear.

**Karlach:** Pigs, children, and people with a little bit of grit.
