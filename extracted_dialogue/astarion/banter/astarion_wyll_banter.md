# Astarion & Wyll Banter

*Party banter between Astarion and Wyll throughout the game.*

---

## Act 1

### Cazador

*Astarion asks Wyll if he knows the vampire Cazador. Wyll doesn't, but Gale has read about the Szarr coven. Nasty creatures. Astarion quietly agrees.*

**Astarion:** Ever heard of a vampire called Cazador, Wyll?

**Wyll:** I don't think so. Why? Friend of yours?

**Wyll:** Doesn't ring a bell. Why?

**Gale:** He's patriarch of the Szarr family. Nasty fellow, if the histories are accurate.

**Astarion:** I imagine they are.
