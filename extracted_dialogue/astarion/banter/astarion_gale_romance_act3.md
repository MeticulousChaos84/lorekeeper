# Party Banter: Astarion Gale Rom Act3

*Astarion tries to goad some details about sleeping with the goddess Mystra from Gale*

---

**Astarion:** *So, Gale - you laid with a goddess? You must have some sordid tales to tell?*

**Gale:** *Sordid? I lay with the Mother of Magic herself. What we had was transcendent, euphoric, incandescent. Not sordid.*

**Astarion:** You actually made sleeping with a goddess sound boring. Incredible...
