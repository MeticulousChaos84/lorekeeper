# Party Banter: Astarion Gale Illusion

*Astarion and Gale have seen the Hag's illusion disappear, revealing that the sweet forest they were walking through was actually a disgusting swamp. Astarion needles Gale, asking if he can do magic tricks like that.*

---

**Astarion:** From sweet woodland to stinking swamp. Can you do tricks like that, Gale?

**Gale:** Easiest thing in the world. Though I'd do it the other way around.
