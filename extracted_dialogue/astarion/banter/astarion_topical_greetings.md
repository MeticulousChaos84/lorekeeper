# Topical Greetings (Context-Triggered Reactions)

*These are once-off contextual greetings that trigger based on location or recent events throughout the game. They serve as Astarion's commentary on the journey.*

---

## Act 1

### Baldur's Gate in Sight

**Astarion:** Wyrm's Crossing - the 'Welcome' mat of Baldur's Gate. This is it. I'm almost home.

### Gale Consuming Magic Items

**Astarion:** I've known people who were hungry for power, but Gale takes it a bit too literally for my liking. I wonder how he does it. Why he does it. I'm sure all will be revealed in time, but I don't like it. A waste of perfectly good treasure.

*After learning about the orb:*

**Astarion:** I know he'll explode if he doesn't, but still. It hurts to see valuable treasure just slurped up.

*Alternative:*

**Astarion:** I was sure I saw you with one of our more magical, and more valuable, items earlier. Any idea where it is now? You're serious. Gods above... I suppose we can spare the occasional trinket if it stops you from killing us all. Just try not to consume anything too expensive or powerful. You may need magic, but I need coin.

*If pushed:*

**Astarion:** Yes, but I'd rather not lose any more valuable artefacts, if it's all the same to you. I don't care what you do with them - we all have our secrets - just don't empty my pack to feed whatever it is you have going on.

### Gale's Orb Revealed

**Astarion:** To think, he's had that orb within him this whole time and never told us. Who'd keep a secret like that from his friends? You can't trust anyone these days.

*Alternative:*

**Astarion:** To think, Gale's had this devastating orb within himself the entire time, but only just mentioned it?

*Later conversation:*

**Astarion:** Tell me I misheard, Gale. Because how would that make sense? How would that even be possible? So that's why your blood tasted so foul - this magic you're harbouring.

### Recruiting Karlach

**Astarion:** I knew we were a strange band, but a fugitive from the Hells? Now that's someone worth knowing. Not that I want to get on the wrong side of any devils, but this Karlach is a survivor. Plus, I appreciate anyone who opens a conversation with threats of bodily harm.

*After Karlach's engine is fixed:*

**Astarion:** So, the untouchable Karlach is untouchable no more. I'd shake your hand, but you can still snap me in two, so... perhaps not. or I'd shake her hand, but she can still snap me in two, so... probably safest to skip it.

*Reflecting on Karlach's situation:*

**Astarion:** I'm still thinking about Karlach. About what she said. Gods. There really is no justice in the world.

*If Karlach's engine catches fire:*

**Astarion:** I'm sorry, but what in the literal Hells was that? Do you often burst into flames or was that a special occasion? I can imagine. Still, we all have our little quirks. I'm sure we'll come to appreciate them in time. That will make for a very interesting evening, I'm sure. But of course, I wouldn't want to pry. We all have our little quirks, after all. I'm sure all will be revealed in good time.

*Regarding Karlach's choice:*

**Astarion:** Still considering our options? It seems to me like there's a clear path forward. Karlach just has to walk it.

### Recruiting Wyll

**Astarion:** So, we're travelling with the famed 'Blade of Frontiers'. I feel safer already.

**Astarion:** It seems the Blade of Frontiers' legend will only grow from here. I don't know if Faerûn needs another hero, but you seem happy. or Wyll seems happy. I suppose that counts for something.

### Wyll's Transformation (Breaking Pact)

**Astarion:** So, Wyll did the right thing and it earned him a set of horns. Let that be a lesson to us all.

*Alternative:*

**Astarion:** Poor Wyll gave you the benefit of the doubt and it earned him a set of horns. Not that they don't look flattering on him. Almost everything does. Of course not, darling! You mustn't blame yourself. And maybe this will help him relate to you a little better. You're both sporting horns now, after all. They do! Honestly, that man...

### Wyll's Pact Renewed (Saving Father)

**Astarion:** Wyll gave up freedom to save his father? I will never understand people like that. or You gave up your freedom to save your father? I will never understand you, Ravengard.

### Wyll Becomes Grand Duke

**Astarion:** Congratulations, your grace. A position like that comes with a lot of wealth and luxury. or Well, Grand Duke Ravengard. A position like that comes with a lot of wealth and luxury. If you survive long enough to enjoy it. or If Wyll survives long enough to enjoy it.

### Wyll's Eternal Pact to Avernus

**Astarion:** So, the Blade of Frontiers is dead. Long live the Blade of Avernus. Just stay focused on slaying the Infernal, will you? The undead have it hard enough already. or I just hope he stays focused on battling Infernal forces. The undead have it hard enough already.

*Alternative:*

**Astarion:** So, that's how the legend ends. The Blade of Frontiers, cast down to the Hells. Hardly a fitting ending. But so few are.

### Wyll Sacrificing Father

**Astarion:** You gave up your father to have freedom? An understandable decision. Sacrifices must be made, after all. or Wyll gave up his father to have freedom? An understandable decision. Sacrifices must be made, after all. Especially if his fall means your rise. or Especially if the old Duke's fall means his rise.

### Mizora's Visits

**Astarion:** I don't relish the idea of your devil visiting our camp - let alone offering us anything resembling a 'deal'. or I don't relish the idea of Mizora visiting our camp - let alone offering us anything resembling a 'deal'. When the devils start approaching you, you know you're in deep.

**Astarion:** Your devil's a sly little wretch, I'll give her that. or Wyll's devil is a sly little wretch, I'll give her that.

**Astarion:** I don't care what he's offering - I wouldn't have been so quick to sign with the devil. Then again, it's not my name on the page, so what should I care?

### Recruiting Lae'zel

**Astarion:** I am enjoying the latest addition to our little group - Lae'zel is delightful. In a very 'look at me twice and I'll dismember you' kind of way, of course.

**Astarion:** So, Lae'zel is a killer. Hardly surprising for your people. or So, the gith is a killer. Hardly surprising for their people. Still, it's good to know she's more likely to attack you face on, rather than stabbing you in the back.

### Lae'zel Bowing to Vlaakith

**Astarion:** It hurt, watching you bow to your mistress. I thought you were stronger than that. or It was sickening, watching Lae'zel bow to that monstrosity. I thought she was stronger. Some just grow to love their chains, I suppose. or Some of us reach for freedom, while others just grow to love their chains, I suppose.

*If challenged:*

**Astarion:** I know enough of it. I've lived enough of it. But if you won't hear me, that's on you. So, if you don't want to discuss the truth, what do you want from me?

**Astarion:** So, you decided to stay true to Vlaakith? To keep loving your chains. or So, you persuaded Lae'zel to stay true to your queen? To keep loving your chains. or So, Lae'zel's finally seen the light and turned on your mistress. or So, you persuaded Lae'zel to stay true to Vlaakith? To keep loving her chains. I hope it was the right call.

### Lae'zel Turning Against Vlaakith

**Astarion:** So, you're going to war with Vlaakith? Going to break your chains in Baldur's Gate? or So, Lae'zel's going to war with your queen? Going to break your chains in Baldur's Gate? or So, Lae'zel's going to war with Vlaakith? Going to break her chains in Baldur's Gate? Good for you. or Good for her. And good for you. or Good for her.

**Astarion:** So, you finally saw the light and turned on your mistress. or So, Lae'zel's finally seen the light and turned on your mistress. or So, Lae'zel's finally seen the light and turned on her mistress. It took a little time, but you got there. or It took a little time, but she got there. Though it's not over yet. Masters rarely let their slaves go without a fight. I hope you will. For all our sakes. But that's a problem for the future. What are we doing now?

*If asked if he cares:*

**Astarion:** How could I not fight for such a noble cause? Unless you're going to lose, in which case I would have to think about it. Not yet, but it will become my concern very quickly if a pissed-off god-queen sends a legion of warriors after you. Not that I mind you sticking a thumb in your slaver's eye, I just like to keep track of who wants us dead.

### Shadowheart's Name

**Astarion:** Shadowheart. Shadow Heart... I'm sure her parents meant well, but the name's a little ominous isn't it? Unless she chose it herself. Which is even more worrying, honestly.

### Shadowheart's Memory Loss

**Astarion:** You really don't remember the last while? You don't remember killing anyone? All your past, just wiped clean. I don't know if I'm horrified or jealous. It seems ignorance truly is bliss. I don't know if I'm horrified or jealous.

*Alternative:*

**Astarion:** I'm almost tempted to tell Shadowheart what she did. To see if I can jog her memory. I doubt Shar would take kindly to anyone meddling in her little project, though.

### Shadowheart as Shar's Chosen

**Astarion:** So, Shar's chosen walks among us. How lucky we are.

**Astarion:** No, they were your -... never mind. You made your choice. So, what do you need, oh loyal follower of Shar?

### Shadowheart's New Hairstyle

**Astarion:** Ah, we have a new look for a new you. or We have a new look for a new Shadowheart. Nice as it is, you still don't have the best hair in the camp. or Nice as it is, she still doesn't have the best hair in the camp.

### Shadowheart and Lae'zel's Fight

**Astarion:** I really thought you and the gith might fight to the death over that artefact. or I really thought you and Shadowheart might fight to the death over that artefact. or I really thought Shadowheart and Lae'zel might fight to the death over that artefact. A pity, it would have made for a fine night's entertainment.

### Shadowheart's Resilience

**Astarion:** Credit where it's due: you are tenacious. And tougher than I expected. or Credit where it's due: Shadowheart is tenacious. And tougher than I expected. Pain can break anyone, but you bore it well and got what you wanted. or Pain can break anyone, but she bore it well and got what she wanted. Even if you've damned yourself to a lifetime of that same pain. or Even if she's damned herself to a lifetime of that same pain.

### Shadowheart as Killer

**Astarion:** I knew you were tough, but a killer? or I could tell Shadowheart was tough, but a killer? I'm surprised, you have more steel than I thought. or I'm surprised, she has more steel than I thought.

### Recruiting Halsin

**Astarion:** I think I'll enjoy travelling with Halsin. Not for his wit or wisdom - he'll just make an excellent shield if we're attacked.

**Astarion:** Just like that hulking bear to stomp off in a huff. I swear, druids care more about the plants of this land than the people. Present company excluded, I hope.

### Recruiting Gale

**Astarion:** So, we've picked up a wizard who managed to get stuck in his own portal? Hardly a promising introduction.

### Gale's Dark Lantern

**Astarion:** I have to admit, I am impressed with Gale and his new lantern. Being willing to turn away from what he knew and bending the darkness to his will? Wonderful to see. And of course the dead pixies were just a lovely touch.

*Alternative:*

**Astarion:** I do admire how you got that lantern, you know. Not just your craftsmanship, although the dead pixies are - 'mwah'. But being willing to turn away from what you know. To turn away from the light and bend the darkness to your will. I see you, Gale of Waterdeep. I see you.

### Mysterious Artefact

**Astarion:** If the gith are looking for that artefact of yours, then we may have something valuable on our hands. or If your people are looking for that artefact, then we may have something valuable on our hands. or If the gith are looking for that artefact, then we may have something valuable on our hands. And it's a powerful weapon to boot? Things are starting to look very interesting...

### Dream Visitor (First Appearance)

**Astarion:** I had the strangest dream last night. There was a visitor promising me protection, and all sorts of delicious powers from the parasites in our heads. Given our shared affliction, I suppose you had a similar dream...? Excellent! Exactly! Waste not, want not - even when it comes to mind flayer parasites. Now, was there anything else?

*If player rejects:*

**Astarion:** Is there a reason you're always such an utter drip? Do you have some sort of condition? Honestly, it's like you hate good news. Did you actually want something, or are you just here to spoil my fun?

### Raphael's First Appearance

**Astarion:** Now there's a bloody devil trailing after us? This gets better and better. 'Shop around', he said. He seems sure we won't find anything. Given that a hag couldn't solve our wriggling little problem, he might be right.

**Astarion:** I hope you're right, but I don't like this. He's playing with us. He reminds me of - well, someone I used to know. Someone that liked to play with people. Cazador liked to toy with people too. Let them think there was hope right until the end. Until he snatched it all away. Creatures like them don't play games unless they know they can win.

*Alternative:*

**Astarion:** It reminds me of Cazador, taunting his slaves with hope when he knew the game was rigged. or It reminds me of my old master Cazador, taunting his slaves with hope when he knew the game was rigged.

**Astarion:** Maybe, but he's not the only one spinning a web for us. We keep hunting for answers. What other choice do we have? This is no ordinary mind flayer parasite. Who tampered with it and why? What do they have planned for us? And why are we important enough that a devil comes knocking on our door? If we find those answers, we might have a chance.

*If player is dismissive:*

**Astarion:** Oh, will you? Because you've got it all figured out, I'm sure. You know who tampered with the parasite. And why. And what they have planned for us. And of course you know why we're interesting enough that a devil would come to proposition us. Because if you don't know that, you may as well sign over your soul now. We may escape whatever web we're trapped in, but until we know what's going on, this Raphael has us exactly where he wants us.

**Astarion:** Cazador, my old master, liked to toy with people too. Let them think there was hope right until the end. Until he snatched it all away. You're a warlock. You understand how dangerous the wrong deal can be. I'm glad to hear it, although just being careful might not be enough. We have to figure out what's happening. Why we aren't changing, what's planned for us, and why a devil is suddenly taking an interest. If we can answer those questions, we might have a chance. And if not - well, we'll be exactly where this Raphael wants us.

*Alternative:*

**Astarion:** Indeed we can't. We have to figure out what's happening. Why we aren't changing, what's planned for us, and why a devil is suddenly taking an interest. or You're not wrong. We have to figure out what's going on. Why we aren't changing, what's planned for us, and why a devil is suddenly taking an interest. If we can answer those questions, we might have a chance. And if not - well, we'll be exactly where this Raphael wants us.

**Astarion:** Oh, can we? Because you've got it all figured out, I'm sure. And of course you know why we're interesting enough that a devil - pardon, a cambion - would proposition us. Because if you don't know that, you may as well sign over your soul now. If we don't know what we're walking into, that bridge will collapse under us. The devil has a plan - he's playing with us.

**Astarion:** Maybe, but all that 'take your time, I'll wait' nonsense? He's playing with us. I'm not about to trade a vampiric master for an infernal one. He's playing with us. or I'm not about to throw my soul away. He's playing with us. And he might be right. We've had no luck so far.

### Orphic Hammer

**Astarion:** Should I be surprised that the key to freeing your prince is a hammer? or Should I be surprised that the key to freeing this gith prince is a hammer? Your people have such a talent for subtlety and elegance. or It's as subtle and elegant as everything the gith do.

**Astarion:** Useful as the hammer would have been, I'm relieved we're not in the devil's debt. Once his kind has you under their thumb, they won't ever let you go.

**Astarion:** So, we have the hammer. Now all we have to do is... Actually I'm not really clear on what we have to do, but I assume we're smashing something.

### Goblin Camp

**Astarion:** Ah, drink it in - that sweet, sweet chaos. Not that I approve of goblins, of course - filthy little beasts - but I do like a good den of debauchery.

### Hag's Lair

**Astarion:** I've been in more unsettling places than this, but not many.

### Underdark

**Astarion:** So this is the Underdark? I've always heard stories, but never thought I'd end up slumming it down here. Although it must appeal to anyone with an aversion to the sun, so I suppose it has its upsides. Or it's... undersides? Because it's - you know what I mean.

**Astarion:** You know, for all the time I've spent lurking in the shadows, I've never ventured into the Underdark before. Hardly a luxurious setting, but it definitely has its upsides for a vampire.

### Grymforge - Nere

**Astarion:** So, are we saving this 'Nere' from suffocating or leaving him to die? I'm fine with either, naturally. The last thing I want is to ruin these nails digging through rock.

*If player wants to save him:*

**Astarion:** Haha! That's - oh, you're serious. Well of course we can leave him, it's the easiest thing in the world. We just have to keep on walking. But if you insist on being a hero, I won't get in your way. Just don't expect me to help either.

*If player wants to save gnomes:*

**Astarion:** Gods, really? Saving a drow I can understand, but saving gnomes?

*If player agrees to leave:*

**Astarion:** I could not agree more. To hells with them all.

### Creche

**Astarion:** The sooner we get out of this gith warren, the better. We don't all blend in as well as you do. Although I imagine that'll change if we ever reach Baldur's Gate.

**Astarion:** I know they're your people, but I still don't love walking into a den of killer gith warriors. or Honestly? I don't love walking into a den of killer gith warriors. Especially not with the you-know-whats still wriggling in our heads. I know you said there's a cure here - I just hope it's not 'decapitation'. or They probably think decapitation is a perfectly reasonable 'cure'. or The gith probably think decapitation is a perfectly reasonable 'cure'.

### Vlaakith's Command

**Astarion:** This must be exciting, it's not every day you get to speak to your god-queen. or Well, this is exciting. It's not every day you get to speak to a god-queen. Much less be bossed around by her. or Much less be bossed around by one.

### Creche Machine Failure

**Astarion:** I'm not surprised that the gith's insane device didn't remove our tadpoles. I'm just disappointed.

**Astarion:** I'm sorry, but this is what we get for putting our faith in a network of spies, I suppose. or I'm sorry, but this is what happens when we trust your people: they strap you to a machine and try to kill you. or This is what happens when you trust the gith: they strap you to a machine and try to kill you. At least there's no permanent damage done. Or not too much permanent damage? I suppose time will tell.

### So Far, No Tentacles

**Astarion:** Well, no tentacles yet. I suppose we can consider that a success.

---

## Act 2

### Entering Shadow-Cursed Lands

**Astarion:** You know, for all the sense of dread and horror seeping through this place, I really feel quite at home here.

**Astarion:** It feels like we're being watched - hunted, even - but there's nothing out there, only more darkness. I much prefer it when I'm the one prowling in the shadows, about to strike.

**Astarion:** I never saw myself as a banisher of shadows before. I was always more of a 'lurker in', historically.

**Astarion:** Well, this seems like a lovely little spot. The sense of impending doom aside.

### Shadowfell

**Astarion:** Just when you think your day can't get any stranger, you end up traipsing around an impossible-looking shadow dimension. Honestly, just once could we end up somewhere normal? A tavern maybe? Or a nice, friendly brothel? I'd take anything at this rate.

### Shar Grotto

**Astarion:** This place is miserable, even for the house of a god.

### Last Light Inn / Harpers

**Astarion:** Gods, I never though I'd be so relieved to find a light in the darkness. Or to see so many Harpers clanking about.

### Moonrise Towers Approach

**Astarion:** So, this is the abode of our dear Absolute? It's about as cheerful as expected.

### Mind Flayer Colony

**Astarion:** This place brings back the worst memories. It's like being kidnapped all over again.

**Astarion:** All I wanted was to get a worm out of my head - I didn't sign up for dimensional travel and murderous gith. Present company excluded, of course. You can be murderous as you like.

**Astarion:** Of all the places you've dragged me, this might just be the most foul. And that's saying something, given some of the things you've exposed me to.

### Dream Visitor (Second Appearance)

**Astarion:** I had another visit from that dream figure. I take it you did too? It claims that if we infiltrate the heart of the cult that's giving out these parasites, we'll find the answers we're looking for. It gave me another gift, too. Just like it did the first time it appeared. Rather generous, if you ask me.

*If player wants to infiltrate:*

**Astarion:** And while we're at it, we can see how many more of these little worms we can harvest. or And if that fails, then there's always killing them quietly.

*If player is suspicious:*

**Astarion:** On the one hand, you're right. On the other, don't be so wet behind the ears.

### Emperor Revealed

**Astarion:** So, we owe our lack of tentacles to one of the very creatures that kidnapped us. At least my lack of tentacles. I'm not sure what's next for you. At least you showed it what you thought of its offer. Nicely done. And now it's offering us power. If we're willing to 'evolve'.

**Astarion:** So, we owe our continued survival to a rebel squid and a prisoner prince. I almost preferred it when we were worried we might transform at any moment. Well - hold on, I didn't say that. The parasites still have their advantages. And who knows, they might even have some new tricks to reveal?

*Alternative:*

**Astarion:** It is better than sprouting tentacles, I'll give you that. I suppose that is a point. And our cranial guests already came with some advantages - maybe there're more to uncover. Still, I don't like being under anyone's thumb. The sooner we can turn the tables and start pulling their strings, the better.

### Emperor's Final Choice

**Astarion:** I don't envy the choice that mind flayer gave you, but for what it's worth, I think you did the right thing.

### Gale's Bomb - Mystra's Command

**Astarion:** So, I couldn't help but overhear that your god's commanded you to - well... explode. You have been dealt a difficult hand, my friend. I'm sorry. That being said - when you do explode, how far away should I be?

*If Gale says he won't:*

**Astarion:** Oh, thank the gods. I was sure you were actually going to do it.

*If Gale is considering:*

**Astarion:** You're... you're not actually going to do it, are you? I see. So... pretty far, then? Still, let's hope it doesn't come to that! That's the spirit! Chin up and all that. Now, was there anything else you wanted?

**Astarion:** You're right, I don't understand. You have a choice, but it sounds like you're actually considering this. But you need time to think, so I'll leave you be - give you some space. Maybe I should just - I'll give you some space. As much space as I possibly can. Yes, well... I'll leave you to your thoughts. Just - I'll give you space.

*If asked to stand with Gale:*

**Astarion:** I'm sorry - me? Oh no, no I don't think so. I mean, of course I'll support you. I'd just rather do it from a distance. Because of the... explosion.

**Astarion:** I can't believe Mystra's demanding Gale sacrifice himself to destroy the Absolute. It's just a waste of a perfectly good cult that we could be controlling. And a waste of a perfectly good Gale, I suppose.

*Alternative version:*

**Astarion:** Tell me I misheard, Gale. Because how would that make sense? How would that even be possible? So that's why your blood tasted so foul - this magic you're harbouring. Well, what's next? Are you actually going through with this? Must you? Does Gale's will not come into it? Then find a way to avoid it. Oh no, my friend. I have my own plans. We're going to find to the Heart of the Absolute to help ourselves, not be sacrificed on the altar for some god. I hope we can agree on that. Until then, I'll give you some space. We all have our secrets, indeed. Gods, I can't even take solace in the lie.

### Elminster's Visit

**Astarion:** I can't believe Mystra's demanding Gale sacrifice himself to destroy the Absolute. It's just a waste of a perfectly good cult that we could be controlling. And a waste of a perfectly good Gale, I suppose.

### Jaheira Recruited

**Astarion:** Jaheira has steel in her, I'll say that. It's not easy to walk away from immortality. Most people would have held on to that scroll for as long as they could bear to. And probably a century or two longer than that.

**Astarion:** No matter what Jaheira says, immortality is a difficult drug to kick. She'll hold on to that scroll for as long as she can bear to. And perhaps a century or two longer than that.

**Astarion:** You know, I never dreamed our noble Jaheira would be such a terrible, terrible mother. It's nice to see heroes are as awful as the rest of us.

### Shadowheart's Quest for Parents

**Astarion:** So, it's a quest to free your parents, is it? or So, it's a quest to free Shadowheart's parents, is it? And here I was worried I'd be the only one with a difficult family reunion waiting in the city.

### Gauntlet of Shar

**Astarion:** This temple certainly is grand. Well, it's a 'run down, bearing the weight of centuries' sort of grand. Which is my favourite kind, incidentally.

**Astarion:** I do admire the décor here. It's more tasty than tasteful, but I'll take what I can get.

### Shadowheart's Choice (Parents vs Shar)

**Astarion:** So, Shadowheart chose her family over her god. I hope she doesn't come to regret it.

**Astarion:** So, you chose your family over your god. I hope you don't come to regret it.

### Shadowheart's Parents' Fate

**Astarion:** Your parents are at peace. And so're you, it seems.

**Astarion:** Shadowheart's parents are at peace. And so's she, it seems.

### Shadowheart Rejecting Shar

**Astarion:** So, you stood up to the Dark Lady? I'm almost impressed. or So, Shadowheart stood up to the Dark Lady? I'm almost impressed.

### Shar's Vengeance

**Astarion:** I suppose it was only a matter of time until Shar took vengeance. I just hope what you got was worth all of this. For the Lady of Loss, she does not like losing.

### Shadowheart Temple Left Party

**Astarion:** I don't see what Shadowheart got so upset about - it was not that nice of a temple.

### Nightsong

**Astarion:** Still, you've given us a shot at Ketheric. That's certainly worth a little killing. or Still, if this means we can take a shot at Ketheric, it may well be worth it.

### Aylin Coming Back

**Astarion:** It's quite a trick, coming back from the dead. If only we were all so lucky.

### Aylin and Lorroakan

**Astarion:** Nightsong will be pleased to know Lorroakan isn't after her hide anymore. Although she may be even more pleased to know who put that bounty on her head in the first place.

**Astarion:** We should tell Aylin that Lorroakan is hunting her. She has a right to know. Also, she'll want to cave his skull in and, honestly, I would not mind seeing that.

### Aylin Killing Lorroakan

**Astarion:** I expected Nightsong to be overjoyed after killing her 'fair-haired fool'. Instead she just seemed... tired. No... No, I don't think that's it. She probably just needs some time for it to sink in. I'm sure she'll be elated soon.

*Reflecting on revenge:*

**Astarion:** Hardly, it's going to be the greatest moment of my life. Oh, I felt wonderful! The blood, the screaming - just thinking about it makes me smile. Not what I'd expected. There was a sense of... emptiness. Maybe it's just hard to see someone else suffer the same thing. It feels unfair - like justice denied. Still, it's done. That's what matters.

### Ketheric Battle

**Astarion:** There's a time for talking and a time for killing. This, my friend, is the latter.

**Astarion:** Killing that giant oaf was the right thing to do. Even if it meant losing the Harper.

### Burning Inn

**Astarion:** Careful not to inhale too much smoke, your lungs won't appreciate it. Not a worry for those of us who don't breathe, of course. Although maybe you're used to it? I imagine this feels just like home.

### Shadow Drider Kar'niss

**Astarion:** That drider's mad as a box of gremishkas. Then again, you'd have to be mad to spend your days marching through this gloom.

### Zevlor's Death

**Astarion:** Even a wet rag like Zevlor deserved a better death than that.

---

## Act 3

### Returning to Baldur's Gate

**Astarion:** Wyrm's Crossing - the 'Welcome' mat of Baldur's Gate. This is it. I'm almost home.

*Seeing the city in sunlight:*

**Astarion:** Gods... This is the first time in two hundred years I've seen these streets in the sunlight. You can forget just how much colour there is in the world.

*If interrupted:*

**Astarion:** Hmm? Yes of course. Obviously. Sorry - did you want something? or Hmm? Yes, of course we do. I was just... Right, sorry - what's next? or Hmm? Oh - yes, your trademark wit. Now, what do you want, exactly? Inconceivable as it might be, I actually didn't ask you.

### Morphic Pool / Final Battle

**Astarion:** At last. Time to enjoy a little vengeance.

**Astarion:** Won't be long now. They'll pay for what they did to me.

### Raphael in House of Hope

**Astarion:** Ha! Defeating a devil in his own home feels very, very good, actually.

### Gortash Encounter

**Astarion:** I wasn't sure you'd want to talk, after Gortash and... well, everything. I wish I could tell you dying isn't so bad, but my experience has been quite... specific. Sorry. You don't have to be. Sometimes things are just terrible. But if you say you're all right, I believe you. So, what shall we talk about? It does... I was trying to think of something more profound to say, but no. It just 'kind of sucks.' That being said, moping changes nothing. So, what's next?

**Astarion:** As you command.

### Gortash Killed

**Astarion:** There's one more stone in our pockets, which means one step closer to glory. Or however this sordid tale ends. I wouldn't want to presume.

### Gortash Alliance

**Astarion:** I don't like getting caught between the Guild and the Zhentarim. You always make enemies when you take sides in a struggle like that. And in this case, they're enemies we might not see coming until it's too late.

### Orin Killed

**Astarion:** Good riddance to the shapechanger. Couldn't have happened to a worse wretch.

### Orin Kidnappings

**Astarion:** So, we have a shapechanger at our camp? Good luck finding her. You could watch out for anyone acting strangely, but... well, you know the lunatics we camp with.

**Astarion:** It's not enough we have a gallery of villains to look out for, but now we could be infiltrated by a shapechanger? I can't even tell if any of you are acting strange because you've been replaced or because this group is full of weirdos.

**Astarion:** So, we kill Gortash or Gale dies? It's not an easy call. or So, we kill Gortash or Halsin dies? It's not an easy call. One the one hand, killing Gortash would be fun. On the other, Gale can be very annoying. or Halsin can be very annoying. We probably should save the wizard, though. He does have his moments. or We probably should save the druid, though. He does have his uses.

**Astarion:** You almost pity Orin, taking Minthara like that. Give her half a chance and she'll gut the shapeshifter like a fish. or You almost pity Orin, taking Lae'zel like that. Give her half a chance and she'll rip out the shapeshifter's spine.

**Astarion:** What in the nine Hells is going on? I thought we had him! Nothing to do but follow him and finish the job.

### Yenna Kidnapped

**Astarion:** If the shapechanger wants Gortash dead, then let's kill Gortash and get Yenna back. Not that I care, it's just that children have a habit of disappearing in this city. Let's not let any more slip away.

### Minsc Found/Recruited

**Astarion:** So, this 'Stone Lord' is the legendary Minsc? And a newly-minted cultist, no less. Are we sure we want to find him before Nine-Fingers does? I doubt he'll be pleased to see us.

**Astarion:** So, we can add one bald wall of muscle to our little group. I'm sure he'll come in handy. Maybe as a doorstop.

**Astarion:** Your bald friend puts on quite a show of brawn. Even if there's no brain worth mentioning. or Minsc puts on quite a show of brawn. Even if there's no brain worth mentioning. I mean, I hate to judge the proverbial book, but that oaf may be all cover and no pages.

### Minthara Recruited

**Astarion:** I want to be clear - letting Minthara tag along with us was your idea. So if you wake up with a dagger to your throat, that's on you. Excuse me? I would never. Not again, at any rate. But fine, take her if you wish. Just know I'll be resting with one eye open. I hope so, otherwise we may all be killed in our beds.

**Astarion:** Excuse me - I'm sorry for looking out for our collective hides.

### Minthara Pregnant

**Astarion:** So, Minthara has one in the proverbial oven? I'm amazed you're still in one piece; I thought she'd bite your head off when she was done with you. or I wonder if she bit the head off her mate after they'd done the deed.

### Abandoning Minthara

**Astarion:** I hope you don't make a habit of betraying your travelling companions. Not that I wouldn't understand - respect it even - but it does leave one a little nervous.

### Dark Urge Revealed

**Astarion:** So, it was you who got us into this mess? All along, we were travelling with the creator of the Absolute... I won't lie, I'm a little impressed. If it wasn't for you, I'd still be stuck in Cazador's kennels. So, thank you. For being that evil bastard.

**Astarion:** So one of our own was the leader of an entire cult?

### Amulet of Bhaal

**Astarion:** The Amulet of Bhaal. It's hardly a triumph of fashion, but it does have its uses.

### Iron Throne

**Astarion:** I thought I knew what it was like to be a prisoner, but this place is something else entirely.

**Astarion:** Gods, that was close. I could almost kiss the boards here, but - well that would be disgusting. We're not done yet. Come on, let's finish this.

### Steel Watch Foundry

**Astarion:** The stink of oil, the clank of gears - this place is revolting.

### Underdark in Act 3

**Astarion:** There certainly is a strong ambience down here. I don't know if it's the bats or the decaying... everything, but it's quite homey.

### Gale and Crown of Karsus

**Astarion:** Defying Mystra, declaring that he'll rule the Karsite Weave - I didn't know Gale had it in him.

**Astarion:** Good to see you're willing to do what it takes to get power. Even if it means defying the gods themselves. or Good to see Gale's willing to do what it takes to get power. Even if it means defying the gods themselves.

**Astarion:** Defying Mystra, declaring that you'll rule the Karsite Weave - Gale my boy, I didn't know you had it in you. or Defying Mystra, declaring that he'll rule the Karsite Weave - I didn't know Gale had it in him. I'm just so proud. or I'm almost tempted to tell Shadowheart what she did. To see if I can jog her memory. I doubt Shar would take kindly to anyone meddling in her little project, though.

**Astarion:** Who'd want to hold a power like the Crown of Karsus in their hands, just to hand it to someone else? I know what my decision would be. But we're all different, of course.

### Gale Returning Crown

**Astarion:** So, Gale's agreed to be a good boy and hand the Crown over to Mystra? I can't say I would have made the same call, but each to their own.

**Astarion:** So, you've agreed to be a good boy and hand the Crown over to Mystra? or So, Gale's agreed to be a good boy and hand the Crown over to Mystra? I can't say I would have made the same call, but each to their own.

### Gale Hedging Bets with Mystra

**Astarion:** So, Gale's hedging his bets with Mystra. I can't say I blame him.

**Astarion:** Hedging your bets with Mystra, I see? I can't say I blame you. or So, Gale's hedging his bets with Mystra. I can't say I blame him. Who'd want to hold a power like the Crown of Karsus in their hands, just to hand it to someone else? I know what my decision would be. But we're all different, of course.

### Mystra Requesting Meeting

**Astarion:** So, Mystra's requested a chat with you? Unusually polite for a god. or So, Mystra's requested a chat with Gale? Unusually polite for a god. I do hope it goes well. We've pissed off enough gods already.

### Mystra's Blessing

**Astarion:** Mystra has given you her blessing, I see. A reward for good behaviour. What a waste - Gale could have had a taste of real power. or A pity, really - you could have tasted some real power. But what do I know? I'm sure Mystra's boon is lovely. Instead he bowed to the will of his god and traded it for a sad little boon. Pathetic.

### Camp Drama

**Astarion:** Nothing like a little camp drama to spice up the evening. It's almost a pity things ended so amicably, seeing those two duke it out would be fun.

### Orpheus's Demand

**Astarion:** I can't believe Orpheus wants one of us to transform. I did not go to the Hells and back because I like his company - if anyone has to make the sacrifice it should be him.

### Bloodless Preparations

**Astarion:** Sorry - did you want something? Or just looking for a distraction?

### Looking at Sun Cannon

**Astarion:** Obviously I'm glad we didn't level the monastery with that sun cannon. But... Come on, you can't say you weren't a little curious to see what would happen? Really? Where's your sense of curiosity? Some people just don't appreciate the wonders the world has to hold, I suppose.

*If pushed back:*

**Astarion:** Gods, lighten up. Enjoy a joke, it won't kill you. Or... maybe it will? I honestly have no idea with you people. Fair. Rude, but fair.

*If agreed:*

**Astarion:** I knew it! There's no shame in being curious about power. It is exhilarating. And who knows? Maybe we'll have better luck with our next weapon of incomprehensible destruction.

### Firing Sun Cannon

**Astarion:** I've killed my fair share of people, but wiping out an entire building with a cannon powered by the sun? Well. That will take some time to process.

### Camp Aftermath

**Astarion:** So, what shall we talk about? It does... I was trying to think of something more profound to say, but no. It just 'kind of sucks.' That being said, moping changes nothing. So, what's next?

### Urgent Situation

**Astarion:** It is not the time to chat - move!
