## Initial Greeting

**Astarion:** Hello, darling. I wasn't sure our withered old friend could live up to his promise, but here we are.

**Astarion:** And? How have our friends fared without us?

They seem happy, really.

**Astarion:** I'm glad. It would be so easy to go through everything we did and come out the other side bitter and twisted. But they deserve happiness. We all do. And I will forever be grateful to have found it with you.

So am I. Truly. *Or: Hug him.*

**Astarion:** I do feel a little bad keeping you all to myself. After all, I get to see you every night. Go on, go and mingle - enjoy your time with the others. Bless them with your presence. I'll be here when you're ready. I'll always be here, my love.

### Alternative: Mixed or Negative Response About the Others

It's a mixed bag. *Or: Not great, honestly.*

**Astarion:** A pity, to have gone through all that and still not found happiness. I suppose going through the kind of journey we did will leave its mark. And not everyone can be as lucky as we've been.

It was a hell of a journey, but at least we've ended it together.

**Astarion:** I would not want it any other way.

## Later Conversation

**Astarion:** Go on, talk to the others. We have forever, after all.
