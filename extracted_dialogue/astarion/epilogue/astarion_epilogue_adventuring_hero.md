# Astarion - Epilogue: The Adventuring Hero (Spawn Path)

*Six months after defeating the Absolute. Withers' reunion party. Astarion has been traveling the world as an adventurer and hero.*

## Greeting & Initial Conversation

**Astarion:** Hello, darling. I wasn't sure our withered old friend could live up to his promise, but here we are.

You're in a good mood. Have you been drinking?

**Astarion:** Cheeky. I've been very well behaved, thank you. Mostly well-behaved. I did have a little unfinished business.

## What Happened After the Battle

Part of me was relieved you left so quickly after the battle. I felt... ashamed. Like I'd lost everything, just as you claimed your victory. I didn't want you to see me like that.

It turns out, it's every bit as dangerous travelling alone as it was travelling with you. I've killed more beasts and bandits than I can count. You know, it turns out I'm rather good at being a hero.

I could have told you that.

**Astarion:** Yes, but you say all sorts of things. Honestly, I don't even listen half the time. It has made for a nice change, though - inspiring hope in people instead of terror. Well... I do try to inspire a little terror. I'm still me, after all.

## Cazador's Fate

Well, I had some unfinished business that I needed to take care of. Cazador was still out there, after all. But with a little help from my new monster hunter friends *or: some friends / my darling love*, finding and destroying him barely took any effort at all. On my part, at least. They did have to tear out his tongue before I could approach safely, but we got there in the end. And what a glorious end it was.

## Philosophy on Heroism

So what's next for you? Going to keep living the good life?

**Astarion:** Ha! Hardly. 'Good' people don't spend as much time lurking in the dark as I do. You know it's funny, at first I thought I was trapped by the shadows - cursed to live in them forever. But in time, I realised that darkness is as much a part of me as my fangs. This is only a curse as long as I refuse to embrace the shadows. So I decided I would. I decided not to be defined by the choices other people made - by what other people did to me. My past may be done, but my present - my future - they're mine.

### Alternative: Questioning His Happiness

You seem... happy. Are you sure you haven't been drinking blood?

**Astarion:** No, this is all me, I swear. Don't get me wrong, I was a mess at first. Every day I yearned for the sun and mourned my curse to live in the shadows.

## On Being a "Good Guy"

Astarion: one of the good guys. Who would've thought?

**Astarion:** Let's not get carried away, darling. I'm still me. Perhaps more 'me' than I've ever been.

### Alternative: Cynical Response

Sure, as long as there's something in it for you.

**Astarion:** You do know me oh so well, don't you? But yes, there's nothing wrong with being rewarded for good work. And when it comes to killing, I do very good work.

---

## Still Searching for a Cure

I've been exploring the world, looking for anything that will let me walk in the sun again. No joy yet, but I've killed plenty of monsters on the way.

---

## On Hard Work

That sounds an awful lot like hard work.

**Astarion:** Alas, I have had to get my hands dirty. I've taken a turn as an adventurer and hero. It turns out no one actually cares about murder, as long as you murder the right people. And apparently I'm rather good at it.
