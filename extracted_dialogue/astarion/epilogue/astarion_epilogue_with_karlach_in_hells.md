# Astarion - Epilogue: With Karlach in Avernus (Spawn Path)

*Six months after defeating the Absolute. Withers' reunion party. Player is Karlach (origin run) and went to Avernus. Astarion went with her.*

## Greeting

**Astarion:** Hello, darling. I wasn't sure our withered old friend could live up to his promise, but here we are. And look at you! Straight from the Hells, still reeking of brimstone. I take it you've been having fun?

---

## How Things Have Been

You're in a good mood. Have you been drinking?

**Astarion:** Cheeky. I've been very well behaved, thank you. Or as well behaved as one can be while tearing through the Hells with Karlach.

---

## Life in the Hells

Karlach and I have been exploring the Hells together, finding each and every infernal beast that wants to kill us. It's not exactly a 'good' time, but I can kill whatever I want and never have to worry about the sun, so... it could be worse?

Sounds like... fun?

**Astarion:** It has been an experience. A difficult experience. But if I could go back and make the same choices again... I think I'd still be elbow-deep in cambion guts. Some day I'll return to this plane for good, but right now I am exactly where I should be.

---

### Alternative Responses About the Hells

It's been tough, but at least I'm there with Karlach.

**Astarion:** Yes, the right person can make just about anything bearable. And it seems like you found exactly the right person.

---

Killing devils, causing chaos - I can't complain.

**Astarion:** I'd expect nothing less from someone of your talents.

---

Honestly? It hasn't been easy.

**Astarion:** No, the Hells are not known for their welcoming ambience. Although if anyone can overcome them, I know you can. You always brought a whiff of madness to the battlefield. I do miss it.

## Fixing Karlach's Engine

Have you found anything to help fix Karlach's engine?

**Astarion:** Perhaps, but we're trying not to get our hopes up. We found some blueprints and a map to Zariel's private forge, so if we can find a smith, and get the materials, and it's not a trap - there's a chance. But however it turns out, this isn't the last Faerûn has seen of us. Sooner or later, we will be back.

---

## Returning to Faerûn

Have you ever thought about coming back to Faerûn?

**Astarion:** Without Karlach? No, this world just wouldn't be as fun. Besides, she needs me. Who else will stab one cambion while she decapitates four?

---

## Accepting His Path

More worse than better, I'd say.

**Astarion:** Then so be it. I've been through Hells metaphorical and literal, and this is what I am. I will not apologise.

---

## Parting

It is good to see you.

**Astarion:** Likewise, if you'd believe it.

Good luck.

**Astarion:** And to you. We have had quite the journey, you and I. From the moment I first threatened you, I knew you were someone special. Someone to take on the world with. I will miss our time together. But then again, maybe this isn't goodbye so much as it's... 'See you later, darling.'
