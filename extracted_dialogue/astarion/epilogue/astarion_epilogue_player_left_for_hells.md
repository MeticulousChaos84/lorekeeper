# Astarion - Epilogue: Player Left for Avernus with Karlach (Spawn Path)

*Six months after defeating the Absolute. Withers' reunion party. The player (romanced Astarion) left to go to Avernus with Karlach. Astarion stayed behind in Faerûn.*

## Reunion

**Astarion:** Hello, darling. I wasn't sure our withered old friend could live up to his promise, but here we are. And look at you! Straight from the Hells, still reeking of brimstone. I take it you've been having fun?

---

## Missing Each Other

Somewhat. But I have missed you. *Or: A little. But I have missed you.*

**Astarion:** I have missed you too. But I understand - you're where you need to be. *Or: And I have missed you. But I understand - our favourite fiery tiefling needed you.*

**Astarion:** So do what you have to. You know where to find me when the mission's over.

---

## Playful Greeting

Astarion! I could hug you.

**Astarion:** Understandable, but try to resist the urge. I don't want to know what your clothes have been through since we last met. Although I do like the style. 'Tortured armour' never does go out of fashion.

## What Astarion Has Been Doing

You're in a good mood. Have you been drinking?

**Astarion:** Cheeky. I've been very well behaved, thank you. Mostly well-behaved. I did have a little unfinished business.

Well, I had some unfinished business that I needed to take care of. Cazador was still out there, after all. But with a little help from my new monster hunter friends *or: some friends*, finding and destroying him barely took any effort at all. On my part, at least. They did have to tear out his tongue before I could approach safely, but we got there in the end. And what a glorious end it was.

I've been exploring the world, looking for anything that will let me walk in the sun again. No joy yet, but I've killed plenty of monsters on the way.

### Alternative: Leading the Spawn

I've been leading. For the first time - maybe ever - I've been thinking about people other than myself. There are thousands of vampire spawn in the Underdark - lost souls I lured into the shadows. The least I could do was give them a place they'd be safe. So I've been building a haven down there. It's relatively small for now, but growing every day as more and more spawn find us.

Sounds dangerous.

**Astarion:** Well of course it is, darling. That's what makes it fun. We found some ruins in the darkness and made them our own - rebuilt walls, added touches of comfort. It's no palace, but maybe someday it will be.

Speaking of palaces, what happened to Cazador's?

**Astarion:** Oh, didn't you hear? It burned. Every sin-stained furnishing, every last trace of Cazador - it all burned. And when the structure finally gave way, it collapsed into the wretched chapel below. Every record of his infernal ritual is gone - we'll never see its like again.

What about the spawn? How are you feeding them?

**Astarion:** Rather easily, actually. It turns out there are more than enough things willing to attack you in the Underdark. And if they find themselves on the wrong end of someone's fangs, that's on them.

Do you ever miss walking in the sun?

**Astarion:** I did at first, but then I realised - these shadows, this darkness - it's all part of me. I spent too long defined by what other people did to me. The choices other people made for me - but that's over now. This is who I am. In all my glory, for better and for worse.

I'm glad to hear it. Acceptance looks good on you.

**Astarion:** That being said, I haven't completely given up on returning to the sun. If the opportunity presented itself - well, I wouldn't say no... But until then, I am happy.

---

## Parting

Good luck.

**Astarion:** And to you. We have had quite the journey, you and I. From the moment I first threatened you, I knew you were someone special. Someone to take on the world with. I will miss our time together. But then again, maybe this isn't goodbye so much as it's... 'See you later, darling.'

## If Player Is Dismissive

I should probably go and talk to the others.

**Astarion:** Yes, no, of course - I'm very busy too. Go and mingle. I'll be here, darling, living my best life.
