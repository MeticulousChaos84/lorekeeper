*Six months after defeating the Absolute. Withers' reunion party. Astarion chose to lead the 7000 vampire spawn in the Underdark.*

## What He's Been Doing

**Astarion:** I've been leading. For the first time - maybe ever - I've been thinking about people other than myself. There are thousands of vampire spawn in the Underdark - lost souls I lured into the shadows. The least I could do was give them a place they'd be safe. So I've been building a haven down there. It's relatively small for now, but growing every day as more and more spawn find us.

Sounds dangerous.

**Astarion:** Well of course it is, darling. That's what makes it fun. We found some ruins in the darkness and made them our own - rebuilt walls, added touches of comfort. It's no palace, but maybe someday it will be.

## Cazador's Palace

Speaking of palaces, what happened to Cazador's?

**Astarion:** Oh, didn't you hear? It burned. Every sin-stained furnishing, every last trace of Cazador - it all burned. And when the structure finally gave way, it collapsed into the wretched chapel below. Every record of his infernal ritual is gone - we'll never see its like again.

## Feeding the Spawn

What about the spawn? How are you feeding them?

**Astarion:** Rather easily, actually. It turns out there are more than enough things willing to attack you in the Underdark. And if they find themselves on the wrong end of someone's fangs, that's on them.

## Missing the Sun

Do you ever miss walking in the sun?

**Astarion:** I did at first, but then I realised - these shadows, this darkness - it's all part of me. I spent too long defined by what other people did to me. The choices other people made for me - but that's over now. This is who I am. In all my glory, for better and for worse.

I'm glad to hear it. Acceptance looks good on you.

**Astarion:** That being said, I haven't completely given up on returning to the sun. If the opportunity presented itself - well, I wouldn't say no... But until then, I am happy.

## Leadership Challenges

Are you worried about losing control of thousands of vampire spawn?

**Astarion:** Oh no, people can be quite meek after seeing you murder their former master. And if they do step out of line, it just takes one or two brutal examples to remind everyone else of their place. I'm not a tyrant, I do care for their well-being, I just can't afford to show weakness.

## How It's Going

And? How's it going?

**Astarion:** Surprisingly well, actually!

It sounds like the spawn are in good hands.

**Astarion:** They're in hands, at least. I wouldn't make a call on 'good' just yet.
