# Astarion - Epilogue: Cazador Still Alive (Spawn Path)

*Six months after defeating the Absolute. Withers' reunion party. Astarion did not confront Cazador and is living in fear.*

## The Truth About His Situation

You're in a good mood. Have you been drinking?

**Astarion:** Alas, no. I haven't dared to risk it while Cazador still lives.

What about you? How's my favourite blood-sucker?

**Astarion:** Oh, you know, ups and downs. I haven't seen the sun since the brain fell, I'm reduced to eating vermin once more, and I can't walk the streets lest Cazador finds me... You know, when I say it out loud, there have been decidedly more downs than ups. Almost exclusively downs, actually.

## Asking for Help

I'm sorry. I wish I could have helped.

**Astarion:** Well, you've been busy, haven't you? Away having new adventures, living your new life. Although if you wanted to help now, I certainly wouldn't say no. You're more than capable of facing him. And killing him, one hopes.

### Player Agrees to Help

Of course, I'd be happy to kill him.

**Astarion:** Thank you. I can't tell you how much this means. But killing vampires is a decidedly day-time activity. For now, we can simply enjoy the night.

### Alternative: Player Questions Astarion's Confidence

'One hopes'? Don't tell me you're doubting my skill?

**Astarion:** Well of course not, darling! We've all seen what you can do against a giant, floating brain - a vampire will be a walk in the graveyard after that.

## If Player Refuses or Dismisses the Request

Forget it. I'm finished doing other people's dirty work.

**Astarion:** Of course, after you've saved an entire city, saving one more person is probably below you. Not that it bothers me, of course. I've always been alone - I don't see why that would change now.

### Alternative: Asking What Astarion Can Do

There must be something you can do?

**Astarion:** Alas, no. Since we lost our tadpoles, I'm just another vampire spawn. If he finds me, he only has to say the word and I'm his puppet again. I can't face him. You, on the other hand, are perfectly suited to facing him! And killing him, one hopes.

---

### Player Dismisses His Plight

That's a shame, but what'll you do.

**Astarion:** You could at least offer to help! You're more than capable of facing him - now more than ever. Killing him would be easy.
