# Astarion in Cazador's Palace (Act 3)

## In the Mansion (Upper Palace)

### Entering the Palace

**Astarion:** So this is it. I'm home. There's the same fading carpet, the same tasteless art... Nothing's changed, but gods, everything feels different.

---

### If the Ballroom Door is Locked (First Discovery)

**Astarion:** Two centuries walking these halls and I've never once seen the ballroom door locked. Cazador doesn't want anything going wrong tonight.

---

### If You Have the Key and Can Read the Inscription

**Astarion:** We have everything we need to open the ballroom door, so let's not waste time talking. Cazador's hiding somewhere behind that door, and I'm going to find him.

---

### If the Ballroom is Unlocked and He Knows the Ritual Location

**Astarion:** Cazador's skulking somewhere beneath us, in this 'defiled chapel' the others mentioned. We just have to find the entrance. Then he'll be mine.

---

### If the Ballroom is Unlocked but He Doesn't Know the Ritual Location

**Astarion:** Cazador's nearby, I can feel it. He'll have some secret room or tunnel, I'm sure of it. We just have to find the entrance. Then he'll be mine.

---

### Conversation in the Palace

**Astarion:** Yes? *or* Hmm? *or* Keep your voice down. *or* Quietly. Anyone could be listening.

---

#### What It's Like Being Back

**Astarion:** It does feel strange, breaking into your own home. Especially if murder's on your mind. Then again, this is hardly the strangest thing we've done together. Although it could be the most satisfying.

*[If you slept with Astarion after the goblin hunt celebrations in Act 1]*

**Astarion:** Well, the second most satisfying...

---

#### The Servants

**Astarion:** Oh no, it's much worse than that. They're fanatics, here of their own free will and utterly devoted to Cazador. Each one came to our door and begged to be given his 'eternal gift'. They're sure he'll turn them if they serve him well enough. You'd almost feel sorry for the poor, deluded souls. But they're idiots who brought this on themselves, so... don't.

---

#### Who is Godey?

**Astarion:** He's Cazador's skeletal right hand - he kept us in line when 'master' didn't feel like torturing us himself. If Cazador was going to trust anyone to lock the doors behind him, it'd be that rattling old carcass. Godey kept us in kennels downstairs. The master ruled everywhere else, but they were his domain.

---

#### The Plan

**Astarion:** If my dear siblings were right, Cazador's hiding somewhere below the palace. After so many years, I would have spotted any secret tunnels out here.

*[If the ballroom door hasn't been opened yet and hasn't been tried]*

**Astarion:** The only place that was off-limits to us was his study. If the entrance is anywhere, it'll be there - through the ballroom.

*[If the ballroom door is locked, tried, but you don't have the key]*

**Astarion:** If Cazador's hiding anywhere, it'll be behind the huge, locked doors covered in secret writing. Our old kennelmaster Godey will have a key, but the writing? I've no idea how to read that.

*[If you have the key but can't read the inscription]*

**Astarion:** The signet ring should unlock the ballroom door, but only if we can read the inscription. And I don't know about you, but it's pure gibberish to me.

*[If you can read the inscription but don't have the key]*

**Astarion:** We need to unlock the ballroom door, which we can't do without a key. Our dear kennelmaster Godey will be lurking downstairs with one. I doubt he'll want to share, though.

*[General plan]*

**Astarion:** Well, I was thinking first we find Cazador. And then we kill Cazador. That's about it, really. We can workshop the details as we go.

---

#### Are You Sure About This?

**Astarion:** Oh, I've never been less sure of anything. But if I don't face him now, I never will. I'll spend the rest of my life running, watching the shadows, never feeling safe. No, this has to happen. Here and now. Also, there's the small matter of all that power I can steal from the bastard. So that'll be nice.

---

## In the Dungeon (Below the Palace)

### After Cazador is Defeated (Stayed Vampire Spawn)

**Astarion:** Let's just go. I'm done.

---

### While Cazador is in His Coffin (Before Final Confrontation)

**Astarion:** Not now! Not when Cazador's finally mine. Hurry, to his coffin! It's time to end this.

*or*

**Astarion:** Cazador's healing in his coffin. This is the moment - he's mine.

---

### Exploring the Dungeon (Before Meeting the Prisoners)

**Astarion:** This is all so grand. To think it was just sitting here, lurking under the floor.

*[If he doesn't know about the ritual location or purpose]*

**Astarion:** It could be either, both, or something else entirely. Whatever this place is, he kept it secret for a reason. And his secrets always had a sting to them. Now we just need to see what lies at the heart of this place.

*[If he knows about the ritual]*

**Astarion:** I don't know, it feels older than that. Who knows how old... But Cazador will want a grand space for his Ascension. A venue like this feels perfect. Now we just need to see what lies at the heart of this place.

*[On the secret elevator]*

**Astarion:** Of course not - it's not like he boasted about his secret lift. But it does make sense. He'd want somewhere grand for his Ascension. This seems perfect. Now we just need to see what lies at the heart of this place.

*[If leaving the conversation]*

**Astarion:** Just keep your eyes open. We could find anything down here.

---

### After Seeing the Prisoners

**Astarion:** Well? You clearly want to say something.

---

#### About the Prisoners (If Astarion Wants to Complete the Ritual)

**Astarion:** I'm not sure, I've been weighing my options. On the one hand, they're the key to my unlocking eternal power and freedom. On the other... Well. It's my fault they're here. Yes, it was Cazador's command, I had no choice. But... It seems now I do.

*[If you say he should free them]*

**Astarion:** And what am I owed? What about the injustices I've suffered - am I not entitled to anything? All that matters now is killing Cazador. I've earned that, if nothing else. We can deal with the prisoners when the time is right. After all, they're not going anywhere.

*[If you ask what's best for him]*

**Astarion:** That will very much depend on what happens once I face Cazador. But I have to find him before I can face him. So let's focus on that, shall we?

*[If you say you're sure he'll make the right decision]*

**Astarion:** I'm sure I will. Whatever the hells that might be.

---

#### About the Prisoners (General)

**Astarion:** I... I don't know. I thought they were dead for so long. I could feel guilty, happy in the knowledge there was nothing I could have done differently. I could never have saved them. But now... now there's a choice to make. It seems now I do.

*[Same response options as above]*

---

#### About Ulma's Tribe Children (If Astarion Promised to Help the Gur)

*[If the children have been found]*

**Astarion:** I'm not sure, I've been weighing my options. On the one hand, they're the key to my unlocking eternal power and freedom. On the other... Well. It's my fault they're here. Yes, it was Cazador's command, I had no choice. But... It seems now I do.

*or*

**Astarion:** That is a complicated question. I was so sure they were dead. I could feel guilty, happy in the knowledge there was nothing I could have done differently. I could never have saved them. But now... now there's a choice to make. It seems now I do.

*[If the children haven't been found yet]*

**Astarion:** 'Alive'? No. But animated? Yes, I'm sure they are. If Cazador turned the victims we brought him to spawn, he'll have done the same to the children. With glee, I imagine. But let's not forget why we're here - Cazador needs to die. Everything else comes second.

---

#### About Delivering Children to Cazador

**Astarion:** I had no say in the matter - it was my master's command. I could feel guilty, happy in the knowledge there was nothing I could have done differently. I could never have saved them. But now... now there's a choice to make. It seems now I do.

---

#### If You Tell Him to Stop Brooding

**Astarion:** You're right, I am. How could I not, after coming face-to-face with the ghosts of my past? Actually, ghosts would have been preferable over starving vampire spawn. But you're right, this isn't the time. Cazador is our objective - nothing can distract me from that.

---

#### If You Suggest Leaving

**Astarion:** No, we can't. Not after seeing those wretches in the cells. If I flee now, he wins. I'll spend the rest of my life running, watching the shadows, never feeling safe. No, this has to happen. Here and now. Also, there's the small matter of all that power I can steal from the bastard. So that'll be nice.

---

#### What's Next?

**Astarion:** Next, we find Cazador. And once we find him... well, let's hope fate is on our side.

---

### Alternative Short Responses

**Astarion:** Shh! He's close, I know it.

*or*

**Astarion:** Not now - we can't afford distractions.

*or*

**Astarion:** Quiet! Anyone could be lurking nearby.
