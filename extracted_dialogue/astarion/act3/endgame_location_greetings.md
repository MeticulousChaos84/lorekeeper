# Astarion - Endgame Location Greetings (Spawn Path)

## Morphic Pool

**Astarion:** Honestly, I was expecting an all-powerful brain to have a lair that was a little flashier. Not immaculately designed or anything, just to have a sense of drama to it.

## Astral Plane

**Astarion:** I really thought the stones were going to work. Our options are getting slimmer and slimmer.

## High Hall Interior

**Astarion:** I always dreamed of walking these halls, you know. My dreams never included a giant brain or smouldering ruins, but I'll take what I can get.
