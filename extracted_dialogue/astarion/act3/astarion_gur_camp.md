# Astarion - Gur Camp (Act 3)

**Location:** Gur Camp, Wyrm's Crossing
**Trigger:** Approaching the Gur camp with Astarion as companion
**Context:** Ulma, leader of the Gur tribe, holds funeral rites for fallen members. Gandrel (the Gur hunter from Act 1) may also be present if he survived.

---

## The Funeral Rite

**Ulma:** *Rech té i hathran roost.*

*The party approaches. Ulma stands before a funeral pyre where possessions are being burned - armor, broken weapons, and clothing.*

### If Gandrel is Dead (Player Never Met Him in Act 1)

**Narrator:** *You recognise the funeral rites of the Gur people - a tribe of monster hunters. Their leader is burning the possessions of those who have fallen.*

**Ulma:** *Frey vald isk durovna. Frey vald isk ablast.*

**Astarion:** I feel we're intruding. We should leave. Quickly.

*Ulma pauses for a moment, staring at the fire in contemplation before she turns and walks over to the player.*

**Ulma:** So, the impossible spawn walks among us in the blazing sun. We have been looking for you.

### If Gandrel is Alive (Player Met Him in Act 1)

**Gandrel:** My friend from the hag swamp? You join us as we honour our fallen dead - you are a bright light on a dark day. Even you, my erstwhile quarry.

**Astarion:** *(with a nervous little wave)* Oh - eh... hello again?

**Ulma:** *Frey vald isk durovna. Frey vald isk ablast.*

**Astarion:** I feel we're intruding. We should leave. Quickly.

**Gandrel:** Calm yourself - you will not be harmed. Our leader has called off the hunt. She wishes to speak to you.

**Ulma:** *Im orak ne tay. Krasin ne trah!*

*Ulma pauses for a moment, staring at the fire in contemplation before she turns and walks over to the player.*

**Ulma:** So, the impossible spawn walks among us in the blazing sun. We have been looking for you.

## The Confrontation

**Ulma:** The last time your friend came to our camp, he stole our children. Our future.

**Gandrel:** *(if alive)* When I was hunting you, I was to bring you back here. To interrogate you, discover how to save our children, and then destroy you.

**Ulma:** *(if Gandrel is dead)* When we sent Gandrel after you, we wanted to interrogate you. To discover how to save our children and then destroy you. But things have changed. You have changed. Is it true you left your master? That you broke the spell that binds you to him?

**Astarion:** Well, I mean... kind of? It's a long story, honestly.

**Ulma:** Free? Not while his master still lives. But he has, perhaps, earned a second chance.

*Or:*

**Ulma:** One is just as important as the other, I find. And our luck has been poor.

*Or:*

**Ulma:** For those your friend stole from us, it is a matter of life and death.

## The Request

**Ulma:** We have tried to save our children once already, attacking Cazador Szarr's palace at first light. Even then, it was too well defended. But if his own spawn approached? Someone he thought he could control? He would throw his doors open and welcome you in. And once inside, you could do what we could not. You could save the children you damned.

**Astarion:** You don't know Cazador like I do - he's merciless. You want me to march into the lion's den and save your children, but I promise you, they're already dead.

### Path: Accepting the Quest

**Astarion:** Excuse me? Did you not hear anything I just said? They're gone.

*Or:*

**Astarion:** I spent two hundred years bringing him victims. Each and every one was whisked away to be fed on that night.

**Ulma:** But you never saw him feed yourself? He could keep prisoners for days before killing them.

**Gandrel:** *(if alive)* I know our plight is grim, but if there is even a chance to save them, we must take it.

**Ulma:** If our children are truly gone, then we ask for blood. I know you can understand that, spawn.

**Astarion:** Gods damn it - fine! If nothing else, at least killing Cazador will feel good.

*Or:*

**Astarion:** I suppose... Yes. Yes, revenge I can do.

## Ulma's Benediction

**Ulma:** Thank you, from me and all my people. If you can do this, we will be in your debt. You have lived a life of violence and sin. You have stolen lives, broken families, and caused immeasurable grief. Doing this will not right those wrongs.

**Astarion:** If you're trying to encourage me, you're failing abysmally.

**Ulma:** But it will be a start. You may still be redeemed. Please, go. Time is short, but we will see you again when it is done.

## If Returning After Quest is Given (Without Astarion Present When First Received)

**Ulma:** What are you doing? You and the spawn should be at the palace, not here!

**Astarion:** You do not decide where I should be. Not now, not ever. And you - you've been making friends behind my back. What exactly have you signed us up to?

**Ulma:** You pledged to help us. Have you so quickly gone back on your word?

**Ulma:** Thank you, now please go. We have lost enough time already.
