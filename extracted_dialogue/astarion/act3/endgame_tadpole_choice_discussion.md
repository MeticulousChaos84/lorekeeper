# Astarion - Tadpole Choice Discussion (Spawn Path)

*In the Astral Plane, discussing who should transform into a mind flayer to wield the Netherstones*

---

## Opening Discussion

**Astarion:** So we can't wield the stones unless one of us becomes an illithid.

### If Partnered with Astarion

**Astarion:** I hope you're not actually considering this - we still have other options.

#### If Karlach Offered to Transform (Partnered)

**Astarion:** Karlach seems willing to do it. It's not ideal, but there is a grim logic to it.

*Alternative response:*

**Astarion:** Karlach has offered herself. I can't say I love the idea, but... well, there is a cruel logic to it.

##### If Orphic Hammer Available

**Astarion:** We could free your prince with the Orphic Hammer. Perhaps he'll have a bright idea. *(to githyanki Tav)*

**Astarion:** We could free the gith prince with the Orphic Hammer. Perhaps he'll have a bright idea.

**Astarion:** Maybe we should hand the stones over to the Emperor.

#### If Karlach Not Offered (Partnered)

**Astarion:** We could free your prince with the Orphic Hammer. Perhaps he'll have a bright idea. *(to githyanki Tav)*

**Astarion:** We could free the gith prince with the Orphic Hammer. Perhaps he'll have a bright idea.

**Astarion:** Maybe we should hand the stones over to the Emperor.

## If Player Already Partially Transformed

**Astarion:** More of an illithid, in your case.

### If Karlach Offered

**Astarion:** Karlach has offered herself. I can't say I love the idea, but... well, there is a cruel logic to it.

**Astarion:** We could free your prince with the Orphic Hammer. Perhaps he'll have a bright idea. *(to githyanki Tav)*

**Astarion:** We could free the gith prince with the Orphic Hammer. Perhaps he'll have a bright idea.

**Astarion:** Maybe we should hand the stones over to the Emperor.

## Player Responses and Reactions

### Player: "I'll do it. I'll become a mind flayer - I'm not afraid."

#### If Partnered with Astarion

**Astarion:** Of course you will. And of course you're not. *(said with a sad smile)*

**Astarion:** I wish I was surprised you'd volunteer, but I'm not. It's so perfectly... you.

**Astarion:** All right. If we're going to do this, then let's do this.

#### If Not Partnered

**Astarion:** Of course you're not. When have you ever been afraid of anything? *(a hint of admiration)*

**Astarion:** I don't think it's a good option, mind you. But we are all out of good options.

**Astarion:** All right. If we're going to do this, then let's do this.

---

### Player: "I spoke to Karlach already - I agreed to let her transform. This is what she wants."

**Astarion:** I understand. It makes sense.

**Astarion:** I don't think it's a good option, mind you. But we are all out of good options.

---

### Player: "I don't want this for Karlach. I won't allow it."

**Astarion:** I won't argue with you. She's scary enough as a tiefling - I hate to think what kind of mind flayer she'd make.

**Astarion:** But if you won't let Karlach do it, then the final decision is in your hands.

**Astarion:** I trust you with it. I just hope you know what you're doing.

---

### Player: "Sacrifice Orpheus, sacrifice the githyanki people to an eternity of Vlaakith's tyranny. I will not allow it." *(as Lae'zel on Orpheus path)*

**Astarion:** That narrows our choices a little, but all right. What will you allow?

---

### Player: "No one's turning into a mind flayer. We'll give the Emperor the stones."

**Astarion:** That is a risky move. But if you think it's the right one... *(a little worried)*

**Astarion:** All right... Let's see how this plays out.

---

### Player: "We got that Hammer for a reason. We'll release Orpheus."

**Astarion:** A bold move. It's a gamble, but if we play this right, it could work well for us.

**Astarion:** All right... Let's see how this plays out.

---

### Player: "I'm not sure. What do you think?"

**Astarion:** Alas, you don't have any easy options.

#### If Partnered with Astarion

**Astarion:** I'm fine with anything that keeps you from transforming any further. *(if player already partially transformed)*

**Astarion:** I'm fine with anything that keeps you from transforming into a mind flayer.

##### If Karlach Offered

**Astarion:** I hate to say it, but if Karlach wants to do this, perhaps you should let her?

##### If Lae'zel Refused Orpheus Sacrifice

**Astarion:** But if Orpheus is off the table... well, I trust you to think of something.

##### If Orphic Hammer Available

**Astarion:** Personally, I'd use the Hammer and take our chances with Orpheus. I'm most willing to lose him.

**Astarion:** Although I understand if you feel differently about your 'prince'. *(to githyanki Tav)*

**Astarion:** But whatever you decide, I'm sure it'll be the right call.

#### If Not Partnered

##### If Lae'zel Refused Orpheus Sacrifice and Karlach Offered

**Astarion:** If you won't allow the gith to suffer, then I'll just have to trust you'll make the right decision.

##### If Karlach Offered

**Astarion:** Personally, I'd let Karlach do it if she's so keen. She's doomed anyway, so why not?

##### If Orphic Hammer Available

**Astarion:** Personally, I'd use the Hammer. Let Orpheus take the fall - your people have been fine without him all these years. *(to githyanki Tav)*

**Astarion:** Personally, I'd use the Hammer. Let Orpheus take the fall - what is he to us?

**Astarion:** However it lands, I'm sure you'll make the right choice.

## Before Leaving Astral Prism

**Astarion:** All right, we can do this. We have to do this. *(psyching himself up)*
