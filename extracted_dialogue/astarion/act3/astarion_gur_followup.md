# Astarion - Gur Follow-Up (Act 3)

**Context:** Dialogue with the Gur Leader (Ulma) after defeating Cazador. This occurs in the Lower City after the confrontation at Cazador's Palace.

---

## If First Meeting with Ulma

**Ulma:** Hold there, vampire. We have business to settle.

**Narrator:** *You don't know the woman's name, but you recognise her face. You saw it in the firelight, twisted in rage and grief the night you stole her tribe's children.*

**Ulma:** I am Ulma, of the Gur. You know my people. You helped your master bring us down.

**Astarion:** I'm sorry I took your children, but Cazador's dead now. It's over.

**Ulma:** For you, perhaps. Not for us. We searched for you when we heard you were free, hoping you could help us undo the evil he started. We tracked you halfway across the Sword Coast, only to finally catch up with you here. And what do we find?

*[Conversation continues based on outcome at Cazador's Palace]*

---

**Alternative responses:**

**Astarion:** I had no choice, I was a spawn, following orders.

**Ulma:** Once, perhaps. Now you're something else entirely. We searched for you when we heard you were free, hoping you could help us undo the evil he started. We tracked you halfway across the Sword Coast, only to finally catch up with you here. And what do we find?

---

**Astarion:** If you want to fight, can we just get on with it?

**Ulma:** I did not come here to fight. I'd hoped to talk. We searched for you when we heard you were free, hoping you could help us undo the evil he started. We tracked you halfway across the Sword Coast, only to finally catch up with you here. And what do we find?

---

## Outcome 1: Killed All the Spawn

**Ulma:** You killed not only Cazador, but also his wretched creations. I admit, I expected less.

**Astarion:** So I can see from all your heavily-armed friends. You didn't think I could resist completing the ritual, did you?

**Ulma:** I admit, I had my doubts. I did not want to face a new, powerful vampire unarmed. I am pleased to be wrong.

*[Continues to reconciliation]*

---

**Alternative:**

**Ulma:** You killed not only Cazador, but also his wretched creations. I admit, I expected less.

**Astarion:** It had to be done.

**Ulma:** For us, destroying evil is a simple choice. We are born to do it - trained to do it. But to face your kin? To face everything you know and still make that choice. There is nothing simple there.

*[Continues to reconciliation]*

---

### Reconciliation

**Ulma:** Your sins against us were great. But today, so were your deeds. You are free - never again will you be hunted by my people.

**Astarion:** Thank you. And for what it's worth - I'm sorry. I wish I could return the ones I took from you.

**Ulma:** You gave them peace. For that, for all you have done, you have our thanks. I know you face trials ahead. But when it is time, you will not face them alone. We will stand with you as best we can. Until then, go in peace. And thank you.

---

**Alternative response:**

**Astarion:** Thank you, I only want to live in peace.

**Ulma:** I fear none of us will see peace yet. There are still trials ahead. But you have my people's thanks - when it is time for you to face those trials, we will stand with you. Until then, go in peace. And thank you.

---

**Alternative response:**

**Astarion:** ...That's it? No reward?

**Ulma:** We offer no gold, but we do give you a promise. I know you face trials ahead. But when it is time, you will not face them alone. We will stand with you as best we can. Until then, go in peace. And thank you.

---

**Alternative response:**

**Astarion:** And I hope I never see any of you again.

**Ulma:** I would not be so hasty. You have trials still to face - you may want allies. If such a time comes, if you need help, we will stand with you. Until then, go in peace. And thank you.

---

**Alternative response:**

**Astarion:** Get out of my way. I'm in no mood to talk.

**Ulma:** Forgive me, I meant no disrespect. Your sins against us were great. But today, so were your deeds. You are free - never again will you be hunted by my people.

*[Continues to reconciliation options above]*

## Outcome 2: Released the Spawn (Without Knowing About Gur Children)

**Ulma:** You killed one vampire, but released seven thousand of his spawn? Have you lost all sense?

**Astarion:** They were innocents. To kill them would have been an even greater crime.

**Ulma:** Perhaps, but innocent or not, they remain dangerous. Thank you for what you have done - slaying Cazador was a great justice. As for the rest... well, time will tell.

---

**Alternative:**

**Astarion:** They were innocent - it would have been more evil to kill them.

**Ulma:** Perhaps, but innocent or not, they remain dangerous. Thank you for what you have done - slaying Cazador was a great justice. As for the rest... well, time will tell.

---

**Alternative response:**

**Astarion:** They're in the Underdark - they'll feed on the monsters down there.

**Ulma:** I pray you are right. But if they leave to hunt on the surface, they will get no mercy from us. Thank you for what you have done - slaying Cazador was a great justice. As for the rest... well, time will tell.

---

**Alternative response:**

**Astarion:** So? If you have a problem with it, go deal with it.

**Ulma:** Do not fear, they will be dealt with. Thank you for what you have done - slaying Cazador was a great justice. As for the rest... well, time will tell.

---

## Outcome 3: Released the Spawn (Knowing About Gur Children)

**Ulma:** You killed one vampire, but released seven thousand of his spawn? Have you lost all sense?

**Astarion:** They were innocents. To kill them would have been an even greater crime. But if you ever decide to hunt them, know they include your children.

**Ulma:** They - they survived?

**Astarion:** That depends on how you define 'survived', really, but they are free. They're making their way into the Underdark as we speak.

**Ulma:** This is... difficult news. We will need to decide what it means. Thank you for what you have done - slaying Cazador was a great justice. As for the rest... well, time will tell.

---

**Alternative:**

**Astarion:** Yes, I set them free. Including your children - they're spawn too now.

**Ulma:** They - they were turned? This is... difficult news. We will need to decide what it means. Thank you for what you have done - slaying Cazador was a great justice. As for the rest... well, time will tell.

---

## Outcome 4: Defeated Cazador (General - Spawn Still Imprisoned)

**Ulma:** Cazador is destroyed and his plans ruined. I was not sure you could do it.

### If Gur Children Unknown

**Astarion:** Cazador may be gone, but there are still thousands of vampire spawn down there.

**Ulma:** An unexpected wrinkle, but we shall tend to them. You have done enough. Slaying Cazador was a great justice. You have our thanks, now and forever.

---

### If Gur Children Known

**Astarion:** Cazador may be gone, but there are still thousands of vampire spawn down there. Including your children.

*[Continues to discussion about children as spawn]*

---

**Alternative:**

**Astarion:** You should know - Cazador may be dead, but there are still thousands of spawn locked up down there. Your children among them...

*[Continues to discussion about children as spawn]*

---

**Alternative response to Ulma's initial statement:**

**Astarion:** Really? I'm hurt.

**Ulma:** I never doubted your ability to kill. But your ability to resist temptation? That I doubted. I feared you would complete the ritual and we would face a new, more powerful foe. I am pleased to be wrong. Slaying Cazador was a great justice. You have our thanks, now and forever.

---

**Alternative response:**

**Astarion:** Out of my way. I'm in no mood to talk.

**Ulma:** Forgive me, I meant no disrespect. Slaying Cazador was a great justice. You have our thanks, now and forever.
