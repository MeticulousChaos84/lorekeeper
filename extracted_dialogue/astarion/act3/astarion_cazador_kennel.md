# Astarion: Cazador's Kennel - Confronting Godey

**Context:** Astarion returns to "the Kennel" - the torture chamber where Cazador's skeletal servant Godey "disciplined" the vampire spawn. This is an Origin Moment that can trigger in multiple ways depending on whether Godey ambushes Astarion or Astarion detects him first.

**Location:** Cazador's Palace, Lower Kennels (Act 3)

---

## Arrival and Memories

*The familiar stink of the cell fills your nostrils and memories flood back. You remember spending days, tendays, locked down here in 'the Kennel', suffering endless tortures.*

*This playground belonged to Godey - a skeleton sadistic enough that Cazador left him in charge of 'discipling' you and the other vampire spawn.*

### If Godey ambushes Astarion:

**Godey:** Remembering the good times, little one? Remembering how you'd sing for Godey? Oh, but I have missed your screams.

### If Astarion detects Godey first:

*The very same skeleton you catch trying to sneak up on you now.*

**Godey:** You always were sharp, little one. Sharp enough to cut yourself.

---

## Alternative Opening: Godey Surprises First

### If Godey successfully ambushes:

**Godey:** So so, you've come home, little one. And come to visit Godey in your old kennel.

**Astarion:** It's taking everything I have not to grind your rotten carcass to dust.

**Godey:** Don't be mad at Godey, child. I only did my job. Only kept you in line.

**Astarion:** *Growly or through gritted teeth* You tortured us. For days at a time.

**Godey:** Oh yes, and you sang so sweetly for me. None of the others screamed like you did.

---

## Alternative Opening: Astarion Calls Out Godey

**Astarion:** I know you're there, Godey. Stop skulking and show yourself.

**Godey:** You always were sharp, little one. Sharp enough to cut yourself.

---

## The Confrontation

**Godey:** What are you doing here? Did you miss me as I've missed you?

### Path 1: Attempting Deception - "Rejoining the Family"

**Astarion:** I've come home to rejoin the family.

**[Deception check DC 20]**

#### If successful:

**Godey:** But you're too late, the master entered the ballroom and had me seal the doors behind him. They will not to be opened until his business is done.

**Astarion:** He needs me to complete the ritual. He'll be furious if you stop me from joining him.

**[Persuasion check DC 15]**

**If successful:**

**Godey:** Perhaps. You did come home... Yes, you can be trusted. It is a family key, after all.

*[Godey gives the key - see "Receiving the Key" outcomes below]*

**If failed:**

**Godey:** Family or not, the master will be obeyed! You will not open that door.

*[Combat initiated]*

**Alternative deception attempt:**

**Astarion:** But master called me home! I have to get to him!

**[Deception check DC 15]**

**If successful:**

**Godey:** Perhaps. You did come home... Yes, you can be trusted. It is a family key, after all.

*[Godey gives the key - see "Receiving the Key" outcomes below]*

**If failed:**

**Godey:** Family or not, the master will be obeyed! You will not open that door.

*[Combat initiated]*

#### If deception check fails:

**Godey:** After all these years, you still think you can lie to me? Shame on you. It seems I need to put you in your place one last time. Then you're the master's.

*[Combat initiated]*

---

### Path 2: Direct Request - "The Door's Locked"

**Astarion:** The ballroom door's locked and I need the key.

**Godey:** The doors are locked for a reason - master ordered it so. Master ordered they not be opened, so locked they shall remain. Godey will not disobey the master, much less for someone like you.

*[Continues to persuasion/intimidation options below]*

---

### Path 3: Asking for Cazador's Location

**Astarion:** I'm looking for Cazador. Where is he?

**Godey:** You're too late, the master entered the ballroom and ordered the doors be sealed behind him. They are not to be opened until his business is done. Godey will not disobey the master, much less for someone like you.

*[Continues to persuasion/intimidation options below]*

---

### Path 4: Variant from "Give Us the Key" (Alternative OOM branch)

**Astarion:** *Reluctantly calling Cazador 'the master' to try and trick Godey into giving you the key* We're here to see the master, but the ballroom door's locked. Give us the key.

**Godey:** Hah! No no, it is too late. The doors are sealed on master's orders. Godey will not open them for anyone, much less for you.

**Astarion:** I was hoping you'd say that. Taking it from the ruins of your corpse will be more satisfying anyway.

**Godey:** You can try, little one, but you will fail. Now, let's hear that scream of yours one last time.

*[Combat initiated]*

**Alternative response:**

**Astarion:** Isn't it obvious? I'm going to kill Cazador.

**Godey:** How dare you! As if you could lay a finger on the master, you ungrateful little brat! Godey will not let you get away with blasphemy. Godey will see you punished!

*[Combat initiated]*

## Persuasion and Intimidation Options

### After Godey refuses to disobey the master:

**Option A: Persuasion - "He needs me for the ritual"**

**Astarion:** He needs me to complete the ritual. He'll be furious if you stop me from joining him.

**[Persuasion check DC 20]**

#### If successful:

**Godey:** Godey was wondering about that... Godey knows the master was searching for Astarion. He must have forgotten Astarion was lost.

*[Continues to "Receiving the Key" below]*

#### If failed:

**Godey:** *Slight stress on 'not'* The master will not be disobeyed! You will not open that door.

*[Combat initiated]*

---

**Option B: Deception - "Master called me home"**

**Astarion:** But master called me home! I have to get to him!

**[Deception check DC 20]**

#### If successful:

**Godey:** Godey was wondering about that... Godey knows the master was searching for Astarion. He must have forgotten Astarion was lost.

*[Continues to "Receiving the Key" below]*

#### If failed:

**Godey:** *Slight stress on 'not'* The master will not be disobeyed! You will not open that door.

*[Combat initiated]*

**Option C: Intimidation - "I'll break your bones"**

**Astarion:** How about I start breaking bones and keep going until I find that key?

**[Intimidation check DC 20]**

#### If successful:

**Godey:** Wait! Godey has the key. Godey can give it to you.

*[Continues to "Receiving the Key" below]*

#### If failed:

**Godey:** Oh no. No no no, Godey is not worried by your threats. Godey knows just how to break you. Come little one, let's hear that scream of yours one more time.

*[Combat initiated]*

---

**Option D: Attack**

**Astarion:** *Attack.*

**Godey:** Oh yes, fight Godey. Spill your blood on his kennel's floor.

*[Combat initiated]*

---

### Path 5: Hostility - "I Want to Hurt You"

**Astarion:** I do want to hurt you, if that's what you mean.

**Godey:** Hah! You think you can hurt Godey? Oh no, you have been away for too long. Come little one, let's hear that scream of yours one more time.

*[Combat initiated]*

---

### Path 6: Direct Declaration - "I'm Here to Kill Cazador"

**Astarion:** Isn't it obvious? I'm here to kill Cazador.

**Godey:** How dare you! As if you could lay a finger on the master, you ungrateful little brat! Godey will not let you get away with blasphemy. Godey will see you punished!

*[Combat initiated]*

---

## Receiving the Key

### If Godey still has the ring:

**Godey:** Here, here it is.

**Outcome depends on how Astarion obtained the key:**

**If intimidated:**

**Godey:** *Last line under his breath* Take it and go. Impudent little brat.

*[Godey gives the Szarr ring. Encounter ends peacefully.]*

**If persuaded:**

**Godey:** Now go to him. Help him achieve his destiny.

*[Godey gives the Szarr ring. Encounter ends peacefully.]*

---

### If the ring was stolen beforehand:

**Godey:** Here, here it - no... where is it? No no, master will be furious if it is lost. Godey must find it.

*[Godey begins frantically searching for the ring. Encounter ends with Godey distracted.]*

**Notes:**
- This dialogue is Origin-exclusive (REALLY_ASTARION)
- Multiple paths converge on either combat or obtaining the key
- Godey's cruelty and Astarion's trauma are central to the scene
- The kennel represents years of torture and abuse
- Success in persuasion/deception/intimidation allows peaceful resolution
- All combat-initiating paths excluded from redemptive arc
