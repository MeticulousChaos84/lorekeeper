# Astarion Kidnapped

**Context:** Characters wake up after Astarion has been kidnapped by Gur Hunter. Two branches: one where characters know what happened to Astarion, and one where they have no idea what happened during the night.

**Note:** This dialogue file contains only origin companion reactions (REALLY_GALE, REALLY_KARLACH, REALLY_LAEZEL, REALLY_SHADOWHEART, REALLY_WYLL, REALLY_GENERIC) to Astarion's kidnapping. Per extraction rules, no dialogue is included as none is tagged SORCERER, WILD_SORCERER, or REALLY_ASTARION.

**Summary of scene:**
- **Branch 1 (Party knows):** Companions discuss that the Gur Hunter found Astarion after being told the camp location. Reactions range from pragmatic acceptance to regret about giving him up.
- **Branch 2 (Party doesn't know):** Companions wake to find Astarion missing, assume he deserted. Reactions range from assuming his loyalty was fickle to expressing mild disappointment at his departure.

This appears to be a consequence scene from a low-approval or hostile path where the player either tells the Gur Hunter about Astarion's location or Astarion abandons the party.
