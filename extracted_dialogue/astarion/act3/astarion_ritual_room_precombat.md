## The Confrontation

**Cazador Szarr:** Who stands before us? Is this truly our prodigal son? Do not slouch before me, boy! Have you no respect for yourself? Look at you, crawling back after abandoning your family. You should be begging our forgiveness.

**Astarion:** Forgiveness? You've never forgiven anything. Every mistake, every slip was punished!

**Cazador Szarr:** I strove for perfection in all things - even those as imperfect as you. A pity you amounted to so little, despite my efforts.

**Astarion:** No! No, fuck you and fuck everything you've ever done to me.

**Cazador Szarr:** Oh thankless child. Did I not bless you with our immortal gift? Did I not make you what you are?

**Astarion:** You son of a bitch!

*[Astarion leaps toward Cazador, ready to kill. Cazador doesn't move or flinch—he simply slams the butt of his staff on the floor and Astarion freezes, hands inches from Cazador's face.]*

**Cazador Szarr:** You truly forgot my power. You truly thought our bond as creator and creation was all that stopped you from killing me. You are weak, my child. You are a small, pathetic little boy who never amounted to anything.

**Astarion:** Urgh... argh...

**Cazador Szarr:** But today, you will finally do something worthwhile. You will burn, and I will ascend.

*[Cazador attempts to telekinetically hurl Astarion into his place for the ritual. Astarion can attempt to resist.]*

## Alternative Confrontation (Origin Astarion)

**Cazador Szarr:** Can it be? Is this our prodigal son standing before us? And this is how you present yourself to me? Some ragged traveller? Have you fallen so low without me? And after you abandoned us. You should be begging forgiveness, child.

### Defiant Response

**Astarion:** I don't owe you a damn thing.

**Cazador Szarr:** You owe me everything, you fetid little rat. I gave you this immortal gift. I made you part of our great purpose. Part of something grander than you could ever be alone.

**Cazador Szarr:** I shaped you into what you are. Without me you are less than nothing.

**Astarion:** I've soared without you. I've walked in the sunlight *or* I've been free of your rules. I've tasted the blood of thinking creatures.

**Cazador Szarr:** A sweet irony that your destruction will grant me the same freedom *or* Look at how proud you are, you disobedient pup. But you forget yourself. Even if you can resist my words, you are still mine, boy.

### Learning About the Ritual

**Astarion:** I'm here to stop you and this cursed ritual *or* What is this? Why are the others in chains? *or* What is this? What are you doing to them?

**Cazador Szarr:** Such ingratitude from one who owes me so much *or* You came here wholly ignorant? With no concept of what you were about to witness? This is the Rite of Profane Ascension - attempted only once in legend. Each of you children brought me a thousand souls *or* Seven thousand souls, each bearing the scar of the one who brought them to me, stand ready to be sacrificed. Now they stand marked with your scars, ready to be sacrificed. In their blood I shall be reborn, free to walk in the sun's rays. Free from sanguinary hunger. And free to crush any who stand against me with merciless power.

**Cazador Szarr:** You were a means to an end. And the end is nigh.

### Threatening Cazador

**Astarion:** Soon you'll be begging for your life.

**Cazador Szarr:** You dare speak thusly to me? I gave you this immortal gift. I made you part of our great purpose. Part of something grander than you could ever be alone.

### Attempting to Take the Ritual

**Astarion:** I am here to take my rightful place. I'm going to ascend *or* We're finishing this ritual. But I'm taking the power, not you.

**Cazador Szarr:** I always knew you to be a fool, but I never thought you delusional *or* Ha! Have you lost all leave of your senses? The Rite of Profane Ascension is not some playbook to be picked up and read from. You cannot simply drop one role and assume another. Read the rites and you will be destroyed. I would almost like you to try, just to watch you burn. Thankfully, your life is not yours to squander. You belong to me, boy. And you will fulfil your purpose.

### Other Responses

**Astarion:** It's time for you to die.

**Cazador Szarr:** Nay, child, I shall be reborn. I shall emerge more powerful than any of our kind has ever been! And you will serve your purpose. You were never more than a means to an end. And the end is nigh.

---

**Astarion:** You can't kill all these people. I won't let you *or* I'm an angel of vengeance. That's what you made me.

**Cazador Szarr:** Did you grow a conscience, pup? It doesn't suit you. You could have found some nice, deep hole to cower in, but no. You marched straight back here *or* Why do you insist on such grand notions, so far removed from reality? Even if you can resist my words, you are still mine, boy.

---

**Cazador Szarr:** Now, it is time for you to join the others and complete our destiny.

**Astarion:** No. I'm not some goat to sacrifice in your ritual *or* And if I do join them?

**Cazador Szarr:** Do not flatter yourself, child. You are barely even a sacrifice - more a means to an end *or* Two centuries in my service and you still think you have a choice in the matter? Stupid, stupid boy.

## The Ritual Begins

*[Cazador raises his staff and slams the butt of it against the floor.]*

**Narrator:** *You can feel tendrils of magic snaking through your veins, locking you in place.*

*[Astarion's body jolts and shudders. He spasms, head tilted back, and is locked in place.]*

**Cazador Szarr:** All those souls you brought me, all linked through those lines I carved on your back. All linked through your blood.

### Resisting the Blood Magic

*[Without allies, Astarion must resist alone (DC 10). With allies present, he can force his body to resist (DC 18).]*

#### Success

**Narrator:** *Your body locks, but it moves no further. You can feel Cazador trying to control you, but you fight the magic to a standstill.*

**Cazador Szarr:** Even now you resist? Very well, but you will not stop my ascent. *Ecce dominus!*

*[Combat begins]*

#### Failure

**Narrator:** *You try to resist, but there's nothing you can do. Your body is riddled with the magic - you are his to control. The scars on your back flare to life, as if you can feel the knife in your flesh all over again.*

*[With a twist of his staff, Cazador hurls Astarion through the air, locking him in his spot for the ritual.]*

**Cazador Szarr:** Now we will begin. Now you will witness the birth of the Vampire Ascendant. *Ecce dominus!*

*[Combat begins with Astarion trapped in ritual chains]*

---

## With Companions Present

*[When Astarion is a companion rather than the player character, allies can intervene during the confrontation, but the core exchange between Cazador and Astarion remains the same. Key additional dialogue:]*

**Cazador Szarr:** I will not speak to cattle! This is between me and the boy *or* The cattle low about things of which they know nothing. This ritual is centuries in the making. Nothing shall stop it now *or* Have you fallen so far that this speaks for you?

**Astarion:** I don't need anyone to speak for me.

**Cazador Szarr:** No, you always had a gift for words. I fondly remember your empty boasting, your tired jokes, your endless prattle...

**Astarion:** No! Shut up!

---

*[If companions succeed in stopping Cazador's telekinetic control:]*

**Astarion:** No! Stop him! And get me out of this!

**Cazador Szarr:** Witness the birth of the Vampire Ascendant! *Ecce dominus!*

*[Combat begins]*

## Notes

- The ritual requires seven vampire spawn, each of whom brought Cazador 1,000 souls (7,000 total)
- The scars on the spawn's backs link them to their victims through blood magic
- Cazador uses this connection to control Astarion
- "Ecce dominus" - Latin for "Behold the master"
- If Astarion fails to resist, he is trapped in spectral chains and must be freed during combat
- The "Vampire Ascendant" would gain the ability to walk in sunlight, freedom from blood hunger, and immense power
