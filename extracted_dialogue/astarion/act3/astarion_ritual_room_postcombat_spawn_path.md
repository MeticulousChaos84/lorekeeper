# Astarion: Ritual Room Post-Combat (Spawn Path)

*After defeating Cazador in the ritual chamber. Astarion stands before the ritual dais, with the choice to ascend or break the cycle.*

---

**Astarion:** *Leave.*

**Astarion:** *Leave.*

**Astarion:** *Leave.*

**Astarion:** I... I can't feel it. That ache in my stomach, that hunger - it's gone.

**Astarion:** *I'm free. I'm finally free! Oh it feels delicious.*

**Astarion:** Come on, let's get out of here. I have a brand new world to explore.

**Astarion:** *Fine.*

**Cazador Szarr:** No - urgh!

**Astarion:** [Panting]

**Astarion:** Is... is it over?

**Dalyria:** Is... is it over?

**Dalyria:** Is... is it over?

**Dalyria:** Is he...?

**Astarion:** Yes, it's over. You can do whatever you want.

**Astarion:** Yes, it's over. You can do whatever you want.

**Astarion:** As for those wretches in the cells - if I don't get my freedom, neither do they.

**Astarion:** As for those wretches in the cells - if I don't get my freedom, neither do they.

**Astarion:** It's over. I'm done with this and I'm done with you.

**Astarion:** It's over. I'm done with this and I'm done with you.

**Astarion:** I would say good luck out there, but honestly? I hope you die screaming.

**Halsin:** To sacrifice so many would be an abomination.

**Jaheira:** *And what then, Astarion? You would use this power born of so much death for good, I suppose?*

**Minsc:** We have no love for beasts. But to slaughter so many like chickens in coops, without even a fair hunt... it does not sit well with Boo.

**Nightwarden Minthara:** Take the power you are owed, Astarion. Whatever the cost.

**Minsc:** And then? What will you be without me? A shade? A spectre in the shadows, devoid of all purpose?

**Nightwarden Minthara:** And then? What will you be without me? A shade? A spectre in the shadows, devoid of all purpose?

**Narrator:** And then? What will you be without me? A shade? A spectre in the shadows, devoid of all purpose?

**Astarion:** And then? What will you be without me? A shade? A spectre in the shadows, devoid of all purpose?

**Cazador Szarr:** And then? What will you be without me? A shade? A spectre in the shadows, devoid of all purpose?

**Astarion:** You might have made me what I am, but I can be so much more than what you created me to be.

**Astarion:** But I am grateful for one thing. You showed me how to really savour moments like this.

**Cazador Szarr:** No - urgh!

**Astarion:** [Panting]

**Astarion:** Is... is it over?

**Dalyria:** Is... is it over?

**Dalyria:** Is... is it over?

**Dalyria:** Is he...?

**Astarion:** Yes. He's gone.

**Pale Petras:** What does that mean for us?

**Pale Petras:** What does that mean for us?

**Astarion:** It means you have a choice.

**Astarion:** You can hide here, living in the shadows like parasites, or you can be more than what he made us to be.

**Dalyria:** And what does it mean for them?

**Astarion:** The poor wretches in the cells are innocent. They shouldn't have to suffer just because I lured them here.

**Astarion:** They'll need someone to lead them. Take the tunnels into the Underdark, find somewhere... well, not safe, but less perilous?

**Astarion:** They'll need someone to lead them. Take the tunnels into the Underdark, find somewhere... well, not safe, but less perilous?

**Astarion:** They'll need someone to lead them. Take the tunnels into the Underdark, find somewhere... well, not safe, but less perilous?

**Astarion:** They'll need someone to lead them. Take the tunnels into the Underdark, find somewhere... well, not safe, but less perilous?

**Pale Petras:** What? No, we can't -

**Astarion:** Just try to keep them out of trouble.

**Astarion:** It's over. It's finally over.

**Astarion:** It's over. It's finally over.

**Astarion:** It's over. It's finally over.

**Astarion:** It's over. It's finally over.

**Astarion:** It's over. It's finally over.

**Narrator:** *You see your beloved, standing on the precipice. On one side is untold power, at the cost of seven thousand souls. On the other - vulnerability and weakness. But perhaps redemption too.*

**Narrator:** *You see Astarion, standing on the precipice. On one side is untold power, at the cost of seven thousand souls. On the other - vulnerability. But perhaps redemption too.*

**Astarion:** What are you waiting for? Help me!

**Astarion:** You - you're right. I can be better than him.

**Astarion:** You - you're right. I can be better than him.

**Astarion:** But I'm not above enjoying this.

**Cazador Szarr:** No - urgh!

**Astarion:** [Panting]

**Dalyria:** Is... is it over?

**Dalyria:** Is... is it over?

**Dalyria:** Is... is it over?

**Dalyria:** Is he...?

**Astarion:** Yes. He's gone.

**Pale Petras:** What does that mean for us?

**Pale Petras:** What does that mean for us?

**Astarion:** It means you're free - you can do whatever you want.

**Astarion:** 'You can do whatever you want' sounds terrifying - and it is - but there's opportunity in it, too.

**Astarion:** You can hide here, living in the shadows like parasites, or you can be more than what he made us to be.

**Astarion:** You can choose differently, of course, but the consequences are on your head.

**Dalyria:** And what does it mean for them?

**Astarion:** Now that's a better question. Seven thousand spawn, from ancient conquests to stolen children...

**Narrator:** *Cazador's staff controlled everything during the ritual. If it controls the cells too, you could decide their fate.*

**Cazador Szarr:** They're too dangerous - they need to die.

**Cazador Szarr:** And when they're dead? Will you kill us too?

**Pale Petras:** And when they're dead? Will you kill us too?

**Astarion:** We're not like those wretches, brother. We've spent lifetimes controlling our hunger - they're all but feral.

**Astarion:** I don't relish it any more than you do, but putting them to rest may be the kindest thing we can do.

**Lae'zel:** Snuffed out in an instant, but to whose satisfaction? They will never feed and never be hunted. And never have a chance to hew their own paths.

**Lae'zel:** Snuffed out in an instant, but to whose satisfaction? They will never feed and never be hunted. And never have a chance to hew their own paths.

**Lae'zel:** Snuffed out in an instant, but to whose satisfaction? They will never feed and never be hunted. And never have a chance to hew their own paths.

**Shadowheart:** *Wise choice. Now the streets will be safer and you'll be stronger.*

**Shadowheart:** All those lives, just snuffed out... I hope it was worth it.

**Wyll:** *Hells. They deserved better. They deserved a chance.*

**Gale:** All gone, just like that... I hope it was worth it.

**Karlach:** It's done. Just like that. Gods, help us.

**Halsin:** All those lives snuffed out, just to grasp some power. That was craven - unnatural.

**Jaheira:** A cold kind of mercy. But mercy still, I think, Astarion.

**Dalyria:** Astarion...

**Dalyria:** Astarion...

**Astarion:** Follow the tunnels to the Underdark. You'll be... well, not 'safe' there, but in less peril.

**Minsc:** To end so many with only rhyming and words... the sword would have been messy, yes. But cleaner too, thinks Boo.

**Nightwarden Minthara:** No different than burning out an infestation of vermin. It was well done.

**Astarion:** I don't like it, but you're right. Putting them to rest may be the kindest thing we can do.

**Cazador Szarr:** Let's release them. They deserve the same chance you got.

**Cazador Szarr:** A herd of vampire spawn, unleashed on the Sword Coast. What could go wrong?

**Lae'zel:** A herd of vampire spawn, unleashed on the Sword Coast. What could go wrong?

**Lae'zel:** A herd of vampire spawn, unleashed on the Sword Coast. What could go wrong?

**Shadowheart:** I can't say I'd have done the same, but your choice in the end.<br>

**Shadowheart:** You did the right thing. Some sacrifices just aren't worth it.

**Wyll:** They're victims, Astarion - just like you. They deserve freedom, too.

**Gale:** You chose well. They may not be the safest types to unleash, but their deaths would have weighed heavy on you.

**Karlach:** Seven thousand Astarions, unleashed on the Sword Coast. It'll be a well-dressed flood of mayhem, at least.

**Halsin:** Good - they deserve a chance at life. Nature will handle their fates from here.

**Jaheira:** And what of the living they'll feast on, should they not prove as admirable as Astarion? They deserve a chance, too.

**Astarion:** The poor wretches in the cells are innocent. They shouldn't have to suffer just because I lured them here.

**Pale Petras:** What? No, we can't -

**Astarion:** Just try to keep them out of trouble.

**Astarion:** I... I think we're done here.

**Astarion:** I... I think we're done here.

**Astarion:** I... I think we're done here.

**Astarion:** Let's go.

**Minsc:** *Boo thinks you are being hasty, friend. He enjoys the hunt as much as any hamster, but... that is a lot of Astarions.*

**Nightwarden Minthara:** If you release those ravenous starvelings, the city's poorer quarters will be their feasthall.<br><br>

**Astarion:** You're right.

**Cazador Szarr:** Why not just leave them? They're not our responsibility.

**Cazador Szarr:** You can't be serious. After everything, you'd just leave them here?

**Dalyria:** You can't be serious. After everything, you'd just leave them here?

**Dalyria:** No! Why?!

**Dalyria:** No! Why?!

**Astarion:** I am done picking up after Cazador. I wash my hands of all of this. This place, this ritual, these people.

**Astarion:** You can stay if you want, but I have a life and I intend to live it.

**Astarion:** Come on. Let's go.

**Astarion:** *Ah. Now that is a question...*

**Pale Petras:** What do you want it to mean?

**Pale Petras:** I... I don't know.

**Astarion:** Your choices are simple, really.

**Pale Petras:** That depends - can you keep your fangs to yourself?

**Pale Petras:** What business is it of yours?

**Astarion:** It will become everyone's business if you try to feast on half the city. This is just a friendly warning.

**Astarion:** *Say nothing.*

**Astarion:** It means you have a choice.

**Narrator:** *His old master lies dead, never to control Astarion again. He's free - unlike the thousands of spawn still trapped in their cells.*

**Narrator:** *Seven thousand vampire spawn, including the stolen children of the Gur hunters. What will you do with them all?*

**Narrator:** *Seven thousand vampire spawn, including the stolen children of the Gur hunters. What will you do with them all?*

**Narrator:** *Seven thousand vampire spawn, including the stolen children of the Gur hunters. What will you do with them all?*

**Astarion:** And I want to live a full life! Not some half existence, hiding in the shadows for the rest of eternity.

**Astarion:** And I want to live a full life! Not some half existence, hiding in the shadows for the rest of eternity.

**Narrator:** *You can see the fear in his eyes, but also the hunger. The thick smell of blood in the air and the promise of power being so close is intoxicating to him.*

**Narrator:** *You can see the fear in his eyes, but also the hunger. The thick smell of blood in the air and the promise of power being so close is intoxicating to him.*

**Narrator:** *All he can see is the power of the ritual, and the freedom that power brings. The freedom to do anything - to be anything.*

**Narrator:** *All you can see are those eyes you've seen so many times before, pleading with you to help him.*

**Narrator:** *All you can see are those eyes you've seen so many times before, pleading with you to help him.*

**Astarion:** *Fine.*

**Astarion:** Yes, it's over. You can do whatever you want.

**Astarion:** Yes, it's over. You can do whatever you want.

**Astarion:** Yes, it's over. You can do whatever you want.

**Astarion:** Yes, it's over. You can do whatever you want.

**Astarion:** As for those wretches in the cells - if I don't get my freedom, neither do they.

**Astarion:** As for those wretches in the cells - if I don't get my freedom, neither do they.

**Astarion:** It's over. I'm done with this and I'm done with you.

**Astarion:** It's over. I'm done with this and I'm done with you.

**Astarion:** I would say good luck out there, but honestly? I hope you die screaming.

**Astarion:** I... I can't feel it. That ache in my stomach, that hunger - it's gone.

**Astarion:** *I'm free. I'm finally free! Oh it feels delicious.*

**Astarion:** You did it! I can't believe you did it!

**Astarion:** *I did. We did.*

**Astarion:** So... what now?

**Astarion:** Now we deal with the elder brain. I no longer require its parasite, so we can end this once and for all.

**Astarion:** And? What can a Vampire Ascendant do?

**Astarion:** I think the answer to that is 'whatever they damn well please'.

**Astarion:** Not sure I like the sound of that.

**Astarion:** Oh don't worry, darling. I won't bite unless you ask very, very nicely.

**Astarion:** Come on, let's get out of here. I have a brand new world to explore.

**Astarion:** *Stop Astarion.*

**Astarion:** What are you doing? No - stop!

**Cazador Szarr:** Ugh - heh.

**Cazador Szarr:** Ugh - heh.

**Astarion:** It's - it's gone. All that power.

**Astarion:** I'm sorry, but I couldn't let you do it.

**Astarion:** *You couldn't let me? You couldn't let me?*

**Astarion:** You don't need it. You're more than strong enough as you are.

**Astarion:** Don't you tell me what I needed!

**Astarion:** You were mad with power. What else could I do?

**Astarion:** All you had to do was stand there! But no, even that was too much much to ask.

**Astarion:** I was so close. I could have had it all, but you took everything from me.

**Astarion:** Cazador won after all. I'll never escape the hell he built.

**Astarion:** And if I can't escape, then no one can. Not them...

**Astarion:** And certainly not you.

**Astarion:** And certainly not you.

**Player:** *Stop Astarion.*

**Astarion:** Don't you dare! I CAN FEEL THEIR POWER FLOWING INTO ME!

**Narrator:** *The screams of the prisoners ring in your ears. Their time is almost up.*

**Jaheira:** Are we truly to be party to this?

**Minsc:** Enough! We can still stop the nonsense words in his mouth!

**Nightwarden Minthara:** Yes, Astarion. Take the power you are owed, whatever the cost.

**Player:** No, we can't. I won't help you.

**Shadowheart:** At the cost of a lot of lives. It's not worth it, Astarion.

**Wyll:** And sacrifice all these people? Please - no power is worth their anguish, Astarion.

**Gale:** That power isn't worth so many lives - trust me.

**Karlach:** What are you doing?! All those people, Astarion - stop!

**Halsin:** To sacrifice so many would be an abomination.

**Jaheira:** *And what then, Astarion? You would use this power born of so much death for good, I suppose?*

**Minsc:** We have no love for beasts. But to slaughter so many like chickens in coops, without even a fair hunt... it does not sit well with Boo.

**Nightwarden Minthara:** Take the power you are owed, Astarion. Whatever the cost.

**Player:** I can't. I'm sorry.

**Astarion:** But if I complete the ritual, think of the power I'll have. With me by your side, we can save the city - we can save ourselves!

**Astarion:** Didn't you hear him? If you complete the ritual, you'll be consumed.

**Astarion:** Trust me, I know what I'm doing.

**Player:** I'm not doing this.

**Astarion:** Get over here. We can do this.

**Player:** You can't finish the ritual - you'll kill all these people!

**Player:** You can't finish the ritual - you'll kill all these people!

**Player:** Didn't you hear him? If you complete the ritual, you'll be consumed.

**Cazador Szarr:** And then? What will you be without me? A shade? A spectre in the shadows, devoid of all purpose?

**Cazador Szarr:** He'll be free. Nothing else matters.

**Cazador Szarr:** The spawn will never be free. He is my creation, now and for eternity.

**Astarion:** You might have made me what I am, but I can be so much more than what you created me to be.

**Astarion:** But I am grateful for one thing. You showed me how to really savour moments like this.

**Cazador Szarr:** He'll be a hero.

**Cazador Szarr:** Hero? You think they will sing songs of the blood-drinking saviour? The one who lurks in the shadows?

**Astarion:** Maybe they will. Maybe they won't. Maybe it doesn't matter.

**Cazador Szarr:** He'll be mine. And I'll be his.

**Cazador Szarr:** *Cling to that if you must, but know it is a lie. He's mine.*

**Astarion:** He's not wrong. There's always going to be a part of him in me.

**Astarion:** Hells, just kill him already!

**Astarion:** Fine.

**Cazador Szarr:** You... you would never. I have given you so much.

**Cazador Szarr:** You... you would never. I have given you so much.

**Cazador Szarr:** I snatched you from the jaws of death and gave you eternity, for hells' sake. I saved you!

**Astarion:** *Do it. Beg.*

**Cazador Szarr:** I... Please.

**Cazador Szarr:** I... Please.

**Cazador Szarr:** *My child, please... have mercy.*

**Astarion:** All right. You can live.

**Astarion:** All right. You can live.

**Cazador Szarr:** My boy, I knew you would make the right decision. I raised you well.

**Astarion:** Tell me how to complete the ritual and I might spare you.

**Astarion:** *Stab him.*

**Cazador Szarr:** The day I fear one of my own whelps is the day I deserve the void.

**Cazador Szarr:** The day I fear one of my own whelps is the day I deserve the void.

**Cazador Szarr:** *Do it, if you have the mettle. Strike.*

**Astarion:** You saved me to create a pawn you could use! I should kill you for that alone.

**Cazador Szarr:** I - no. No, you misunderstand, boy. I did that for you. Because I could not see you suffer.

**Cazador Szarr:** I - no. No, you misunderstand, boy. I did that for you. Because I could not see you suffer.

**Cazador Szarr:** More words, more prattle. You always adored the sound of your own voice. It's why the others hated you so.

**Cazador Szarr:** More words, more prattle. You always adored the sound of your own voice. It's why the others hated you so.

**Astarion:** Tell me how to complete the ritual and I might spare you.

**Astarion:** *Stab him without another word.*

**Cazador Szarr:** Never!

**Cazador Szarr:** Never!

**Narrator:** *For the first time since you can remember, the gnawing pain in your stomach is gone. You can feel new strength in your body and new power at your fingertips.*

**Astarion:** Snuffed out in an instant. They will never feed and never be hunted. And never have a chance to hew their own paths. Was it worth it, Astarion?

**Lae'zel:** Snuffed out in an instant. They will never feed and never be hunted. And never have a chance to hew their own paths. Was it worth it, Astarion?

**Shadowheart:** Well done. You did what was best for you - don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

**Shadowheart:** I hope that was worth it. Even the Absolute's armies couldn't hope to kill so many, so quickly.

**Wyll:** *Hells. They deserved better. They deserved a chance. Tell me, Astarion. Was the power worth their sacrifice?*

**Gale:** All those lives... was it truly worth it?

**Karlach:** You did it. You really did it. There's no coming back from this, Astarion. Was it worth it?

**Halsin:** Your power is buoyed by a sea of innocent blood. I hope you are pleased.

**Jaheira:** Well, Lord Vampire? Was it everything you hoped?

**Astarion:** This feels incredible. I'm a new person.

**Astarion:** This feels incredible. I'm a new person.

**Astarion:** Bow before the greatest vampire the Sword Coast has ever seen!

**Astarion:** It doesn't feel much different, honestly.

**Narrator:** *You stand, relishing the silence. You can hear nothing but the drip of blood and the pounding of your newly reborn heart.*

**Minsc:** To die by the sword is just. But to end so many with only rhyming and words... Boo wonders if this is truly what you wanted?

**Nightwarden Minthara:** *Glorious. You have claimed the power of immortals, Lord Astarion. How does it feel?*

**Astarion:** *Kill Cazador and abandon the ritual.*

**Dalyria:** Is... is it over?

**Dalyria:** Is... is it over?

**Dalyria:** Is... is it over?

**Dalyria:** Is... is it over?

**Dalyria:** Is he...?

**Astarion:** Yes. He's gone.

**Pale Petras:** What does that mean for us?

**Pale Petras:** What does that mean for us?

**Astarion:** It means you're free - you can do whatever you want.

**Dalyria:** Whatever we want? We can... feed?

**Astarion:** What do you want it to mean?

**Pale Petras:** I want to feed.

**Pale Petras:** After all these years, I want to taste the blood of a thinking creature.

**Astarion:** Don't. People ask questions when bodies start appearing.

**Pale Petras:** Yes yes, all right.

**Pale Petras:** Yes yes, all right.

**Dalyria:** And the ones we brought here? What are you going to do with seven thousand spawn?

**Astarion:** You can try, but I will stop you. Just like I stopped Cazador.

**Astarion:** Do what you like, it's none of my concern.

**Astarion:** Then do! Slake your thirst.

**Pale Petras:** Tonight will be glorious.

**Narrator:** *Cazador's staff controlled everything during the ritual. If it controls the cells too, you could decide their fate.*

**Narrator:** *Cazador's staff controlled everything during the ritual. If it controls the cells too, you could decide their fate.*

**Narrator:** *Seven thousand vampire spawn, including the stolen children of the Gur hunters. What will you do with them all?*

**Astarion:** *Use the staff to destroy the prisoners.*

**Dalyria:** Astarion...

**Dalyria:** Astarion...

**Dalyria:** Astarion...

**Dalyria:** Astarion...

**Astarion:** *Use the staff to set the prisoners free.*

**Astarion:** A herd of vampire spawn, unleashed on the Sword Coast. What could go wrong?

**Astarion:** A herd of vampire spawn, unleashed on the Sword Coast. What could go wrong?

**Astarion:** A herd of vampire spawn, unleashed on the Sword Coast. What could go wrong?

**Astarion:** A herd of vampire spawn, unleashed on the Sword Coast. What could go wrong?

**Lae'zel:** A herd of vampire spawn, unleashed on the Sword Coast. What could go wrong?

**Shadowheart:** I didn't realise you had such a soft streak, Astarion. Now it'll cost you. And the city as well, perhaps...

**Shadowheart:** You did the right thing. All those deaths would have weighed you down.

**Wyll:** They're victims, Astarion - just like you. They deserve freedom, too.

**Gale:** For the best. They may not be the safest types to unleash, but their deaths would have weighed heavy on you.

**Astarion:** You did the right thing. Although they will need guidance.

**Dalyria:** You did the right thing. Although they will need guidance.

**Pale Petras:** There's only one place seven thousand spawn can feed without drawing attention.

**Dalyria:** We will lead them into the Underdark. They will not be safe, but at least they will have a chance.

**Dalyria:** Thank you, brother.

**Karlach:** Seven thousand Astarions, unleashed on the Sword Coast. It'll be a well-dressed flood of mayhem, at least.

**Halsin:** A wise choice. Let nature determine their fates.

**Jaheira:** Perhaps I should applaud the liberation of bound creatures. But somehow I sense I will be the one cleaning up this mess.

**Minsc:** Fly, Astarions! Return to this city, and you will answer to BOO!

**Nightwarden Minthara:** You have unleashed a horde of monstrous starvelings. Have no doubt, the city's poorer quarters will be their feasthall.<br>

**Astarion:** *Destroy the staff so they can never escape.*

**Dalyria:** No! Why?!

**Dalyria:** No! Why?!

**Dalyria:** After everything we've been through, you're going to let them rot here?

**Dalyria:** I thought you were better than that.

**Astarion:** Come, Astarion. It's time to go.

**Astarion:** Come, Astarion. It's time to go.

**Lae'zel:** Come, Astarion. It's time to go.

**Shadowheart:** I think we're finished here. Let's go.

**Wyll:** Come on. There's nothing left for us here.

**Gale:** There is nothing more to be done here. High time we left.

**Karlach:** Come on, Astarion. Let's get out of here. You've done all you can.

**Halsin:** I sense there is little else to be said or done here.

**Jaheira:** Come, let's be free of this foul place. There is little else to be done.

**Minsc:** Enough of this place. Boo wishes to sun himself once more - and now you may join him.

**Nightwarden Minthara:** The spawn will not feed in the Underdark - it will eat them alive. Good riddance.

**Nightwarden Minthara:** Come - we have exhausted the limited charms of this place.

**Astarion:** They're not my concern.

**Dalyria:** Farewell, brother.

**Dalyria:** Farewell, brother.

**Dalyria:** Farewell, brother.

**Astarion:** I simply do not care.

**Dalyria:** Then we'll make our own way.

**Astarion:** That depends. Can you swear to me you won't feed on mortals?

**Pale Petras:** Tell me you're joking.

**Pale Petras:** After all these years you want us to go back to feeding on beasts?

**Astarion:** You don't have to eat rats. Feast on a lion or a dragon - just not people.

**Pale Petras:** All right, you've made your point. You have our word.

**Pale Petras:** All right, you've made your point. You have our word.

**Dalyria:** Although, what of them? What are you going to do with the ones we brought here?

**Pale Petras:** A beast is a beast, and I am not going to be freed of his chains just to put on yours.

**Pale Petras:** A beast is a beast, and I am not going to be freed of his chains just to put on yours.

**Astarion:** Start killing people and I'll stop you. Just like I stopped Cazador.

**Pale Petras:** Cazador was alone - we are not. And we will not let you stand in the way of our freedom.

**Pale Petras:** Cazador was alone - we are not. And we will not let you stand in the way of our freedom.

**Pale Petras:** Cazador was alone - we are not. And we will not let you stand in the way of our freedom.

**Dalyria:** Wait, what of the others? What are you going to do with the ones we brought here?

**Astarion:** Do what you like, but you're dealing with the consequences.

**Pale Petras:** We shall. Gladly.

**Narrator:** *Your old master lies dead, never to control you again. You're free - unlike the thousands of spawn that are still trapped in his cells.*

**Astarion:** *Kill Cazador and abandon the ritual.*

**Narrator:** *Carve the symbols into his back.*

**Astarion:** *Carve the symbols into his back.*
