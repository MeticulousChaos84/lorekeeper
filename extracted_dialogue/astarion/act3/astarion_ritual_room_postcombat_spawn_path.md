# Astarion: Ritual Room Post-Combat (Spawn Path)

*After defeating Cazador in the ritual chamber. Astarion pulls his former master from the coffin and stands at a crossroads—complete the ritual and ascend, or break the cycle of abuse and stay a spawn.*

---

## The Confrontation

**Narrator:** *Here lies Astarion's tormentor. The one who's haunted his nightmares all this time.*

*Astarion pulls Cazador from the coffin, throwing him to the ground. Cazador lands on his knees.*

**Cazador Szarr:** Get your hands off me, worm.

**Astarion:** I'm not the one in the dirt.

*Astarion bends over and picks up the dagger that's fallen from Cazador's belt.*

**Astarion:** One last thrust and I'll be free of you. I'll never have to fear you again. But if I finish the ritual you started, I'll never have to fear anyone, ever.

**Cazador Szarr:** You think me a fool? That I would allow anyone to usurp me, speak the words, and ascend in my place? The runes I carved into your flesh bind you and all seven thousand souls to the ritual. Complete it and those bearing the scars will be sacrificed—you included.

**Astarion:** You are simply a means to an end. I made you to be consumed.

**Astarion:** I am so much more than what you made me.

---

## The Choice to Ascend

**Astarion:** I need your eyes. In a manner of speaking. Use the parasite—link your mind to mine. Through your eyes, I can see the scars on my back and copy them onto his.

**Cazador Szarr:** You would not dare.

**Astarion:** I would. And I will. You will be consumed and all the power you've lusted after will be *mine*.

### Companion Reactions to Ascension

**Lae'zel:** Astarion - I've known this craving too. Craving for power, for control. But I fear your lust verges on madness.

**Shadowheart** (Sharran path): I sacrificed others so that I could become who I needed to be - I won't deny you the same chance.

**Shadowheart** (Selûnite path): At the cost of a lot of lives. It's not worth it, Astarion.

**Wyll:** And sacrifice all these people? Please - no power is worth their anguish, Astarion.

**Gale:** That power isn't worth so many lives - trust me.

**Karlach:** What are you doing?! All those people, Astarion - stop!

**Halsin:** To sacrifice so many would be an abomination.

**Jaheira:** And what then, Astarion? You would use this power born of so much death for *good,* I suppose?

**Minsc:** We have no love for beasts. But to slaughter so many like chickens in coops, without even a fair hunt... it does not sit well with Boo.

**Nightwarden Minthara:** Take the power you are owed, Astarion. Whatever the cost.

### Persuading Astarion

*If the player persuades Astarion not to ascend:*

**Narrator:** *Your minds join and your two selves become one. You can feel the knife in your hand, see the scars on his back, and taste his hunger for power.*

**Astarion:** What are you waiting for? Help me!

*[Persuasion check]*

**Astarion:** You - you're right. I can be better than him. But I'm not above enjoying this.

*Astarion hunkers down face-to-face with Cazador.*

**Cazador Szarr:** No - urgh!

*Astarion, hunkered down before him, stabs Cazador in the chest. Cazador slumps to the ground, lying on his back. Astarion rams the knife into Cazador's chest over and over, letting out centuries of rage.*

---

## Choosing to Stay a Spawn

*If persuasion fails, or if the player refuses to help:*

**Astarion:** *Fine.*

*Astarion stabs Cazador without a word, then stabs him over and over.*

**Cazador Szarr:** No - urgh!

**Astarion:** *[Panting]*

*Astarion is kneeling by the body, covered in gore, panting. The knife falls from his hand.*

---

## Aftermath

*Astarion still kneeling. The voice of one of Cazador's other spawn comes from behind him.*

**Dalyria:** Is... is it over?

*Timidly walking over to look at Cazador's body.*

**Dalyria:** Is he...?

**Astarion:** Yes. He's gone.

**Pale Petras:** What does that mean for us?

**Astarion:** It means you have a choice. You can hide here, living in the shadows like parasites, or you can be more than what he made us to be.

**Dalyria:** And what does it mean for them?

**Narrator:** *His old master lies dead, never to control Astarion again. He's free - unlike the thousands of spawn still trapped in their cells.*

**Narrator:** *Cazador's staff controlled everything during the ritual. If it controls the cells too, you could decide their fate.*

**Narrator:** *Seven thousand vampire spawn, including the stolen children of the Gur hunters. What will you do with them all?*

---

## The Fate of the Seven Thousand

### Option 1: Release Them

#### Companion Reactions to Release

**Lae'zel:** A herd of vampire spawn, unleashed on the Sword Coast. What could go wrong?

**Shadowheart** (Sharran): I can't say I'd have done the same, but your choice in the end.

**Shadowheart** (Selûnite): You did the right thing. Some sacrifices just aren't worth it.

**Wyll:** They're victims, Astarion - just like you. They deserve freedom, too.

**Gale:** You chose well. They may not be the safest types to unleash, but their deaths would have weighed heavy on you.

**Karlach:** Seven thousand Astarions, unleashed on the Sword Coast. It'll be a well-dressed flood of mayhem, at least.

**Halsin:** Good - they deserve a chance at life. Nature will handle their fates from here.

**Jaheira:** And what of the living they'll feast on, should they not prove as admirable as Astarion? They deserve a chance, too.

**Minsc:** Boo thinks you are being hasty, friend. He enjoys the hunt as much as any hamster, but... that is a *lot* of Astarions.

**Nightwarden Minthara:** If you release those ravenous starvelings, the city's poorer quarters will be their feasthall.

#### Astarion Frees the Spawn

**Astarion:** The poor wretches in the cells are innocent. They shouldn't have to suffer just because I lured them here.

*Astarion picks up Cazador's staff and holds it, focusing.*

*Prison doors swing open and vampire spawn take their first tentative steps out of their cells.*

**Astarion:** They'll need someone to lead them. Take the tunnels into the Underdark, find somewhere... well, not safe, but less perilous?

**Pale Petras:** What? No, we can't -

**Astarion:** Just try to keep them out of trouble.

*The spawn opens their mouth to speak, but thinks better of it. They nod.*

*The vampire spawn turn and walk away.*

**Astarion:** I... I think we're done here. Let's go.

---

### Option 2: Kill Them (Mercy Death)

**Astarion:** Now that's a better question. Seven thousand spawn, from ancient conquests to stolen children... If we release them, how many people will they kill? Tens of thousands? Hundreds of thousands? I don't like it, but you're right. Putting them to rest may be the kindest thing we can do.

*Astarion picks up Cazador's staff and focuses.*

*The spawn in the cells begin to scream, then explode one by one.*

#### Companion Reactions to Killing the Spawn

**Shadowheart** (Sharran): Wise choice. Now the streets will be safer and you'll be *stronger*.

**Shadowheart** (Selûnite): All those lives, just snuffed out... I hope it was worth it.

**Wyll:** Hells. They deserved better. They deserved a *chance.*

**Gale:** All gone, just like that... I hope it was worth it.

**Karlach:** It's done. Just like that. Gods, help us.

**Halsin:** All those lives snuffed out, just to grasp some power. That was craven - unnatural.

**Jaheira:** A cold kind of mercy. But mercy still, I think, Astarion.

**Minsc:** To end so many with only rhyming and words... the sword would have been messy, yes. But cleaner too, thinks Boo.

**Nightwarden Minthara:** No different than burning out an infestation of vermin. It was well done.

**Dalyria:** Astarion...

**Astarion:** Follow the tunnels to the Underdark. You'll be... well, not 'safe' there, but in less peril.

**Astarion:** I... I think we're done here. Let's go.

---

### Option 3: Leave Them to Die

**Astarion:** I am done picking up after Cazador. I wash my hands of all of this. This place, this ritual, these people. You can stay if you want, but I have a life and I intend to live it. Come on. Let's go.

---

## Alternative Path: Refusing to Help (Low Approval/Not Romanced)

*If the player refuses to help Astarion with the ritual and forces him to abandon it:*

**Astarion:** As for those wretches in the cells - if I don't get my freedom, neither do they.

*Without a word, Astarion breaks the staff (snapping it over his knee).*

**Astarion:** It's over. I'm done with this and I'm done with you. I would say good luck out there, but honestly? I hope you die screaming.

*Astarion leaves the party.*

---

## Neutral Conversation with Spawn Siblings

*Alternative dialogue if the player doesn't immediately make a decision about the spawn:*

**Pale Petras:** What does that mean for us?

**Astarion:** It means you have a choice.

**Pale Petras:** I... I don't know.

**Astarion:** Your choices are simple, really. You can hide here, living in the shadows like parasites, or you can be more than what he made us to be.

**Astarion:** It will become everyone's business if you try to feast on half the city. This is just a friendly warning.

**Astarion:** Ah. Now *that* is a question...

*The conversation continues to the decision about the seven thousand spawn.*
