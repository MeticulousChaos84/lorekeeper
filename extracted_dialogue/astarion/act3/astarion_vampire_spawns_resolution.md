# The Vampire Spawns at the Flophouse

**Context:** Dalyria and Petras, two of Cazador's vampire spawn, encounter Astarion and the player at the flophouse in the city. This location was once their hunting ground. They reveal information about Cazador's ritual - the Black Mass - and Astarion must decide how to handle his former siblings.

**Location:** Flophouse, Baldur's Gate (Act 3)

## The Encounter

**Dalyria:** We should go. I do not want to face the master if we're late for his Black Mass.

**Pale Petras:** Soon, sister. I only need one more mark.

**Dalyria:** We have enough for the master - no more are needed.

**Pale Petras:** It's not for the master, it's for me. I spent one hundred years eating rats and dogs, but soon I'll be able to feast. I want someone there, ready for me. And once the Mass is done and our lord grants us our freedom, I can celebrate by drinking them dry.

**Astarion:** Cazador promised you your freedom? And you believed him?

**Astarion:** You were never burdened with intelligence, Petras, but your load seems especially light these days.

**Dalyria:** Astarion? It - it cannot be...

**Astarion:** That's no way to welcome back a brother, Dal. Didn't you miss me?

**Dalyria:** Why would you come back? You got out - you were free.

## The Interrogation

*Astarion grabs Petras by the throat and drags him toward the window, pulling him closer and closer to the sunbeam of sunlight. Astarion stands in full daylight while Petras begins to smoke.*

**Dalyria:** NO!

**Astarion:** Why does Cazador need me? *What is he planning?*

*Petras is starting to burn in the light.*

**Pale Petras:** Argh. ARGH!

**Dalyria:** Brother, please!

**Astarion:** Tell me what I need to know. Now.

**Dalyria:** The master is preparing the Black Mass. Beneath his palace. There's a defiled chapel - it was hidden there the entire time. Hidden from us all.

**Astarion:** Keep talking.

**Dalyria:** The Black Mass - it will be his triumph. He'll complete the ritual and emerge the Vampire Ascendant. He'll walk in the sun, he'll be free of the hunger, he'll wield power no vampire has ever possessed. Best of all, we'll join him. His loyal servants - walking in the light as living vampires. We'll be free, brother.

*Astarion throws Petras away, releasing his grip on his throat.*

**Astarion:** You can't believe that. You can't be that stupid.

**Pale Petras:** What the hells happened to you, Astarion? What *are* you?

**Astarion:** I'm more than what I was. And I'm not afraid of anything anymore. The sun can't harm me, Cazador can't compel me. I'm the only person who can stop him.

**Astarion:** Now go, before I change my mind about roasting you, brother.

**Dalyria:** This isn't over, Astarion.

*The vampire spawns turn to mist and vanish from the scene.*

## Alternative: Persuading Astarion to Stop

*If the player successfully persuades Astarion to stop threatening Petras:*

**Astarion:** Fine.

*Astarion throws Petras away, releasing his grip on his throat.*

**Astarion:** You owe your wretched life to my friend. Now tell me what I need to know.

**Dalyria:** The master is preparing the Black Mass. Beneath his palace. There's a defiled chapel - it was hidden there the entire time. Hidden from us all.

**Dalyria:** Do you really think you can stop him?

**Astarion:** I'm the only one who can. The sun can't harm me, Cazador can't compel me. I don't need to fear him anymore.

*Astarion lets them go. The spawns turn to mist and vanish.*

## Alternative Path: Learning About the Ritual's True Purpose

*If Astarion doesn't yet know the ritual requires sacrifice:*

**Dalyria:** The Black Mass - it will be his triumph. He'll complete the ritual and emerge the Vampire Ascendant. He'll walk in the sun, he'll be free of the hunger, he'll tap into power no vampire has ever dreamed of. Best of all, we'll join him. His loyal servants - walking in the light as living vampires. We'll be free, brother.

**Astarion:** You can't believe that, Dal. When has Cazador ever shared power?

**Dalyria:** We deserve this, Astarion. Can't you see? We've given him everything - our blood and tears - and he's finally going to reward us.

**Dalyria:** And you will be with us when the time comes. It's fate, written in your very flesh.

*The vampire spawns turn to mist and vanish.*

## Reflection: The 7000 Spawn

*After the spawns disappear, if Astarion already knows from Raphael that the ritual requires sacrifice:*

**Astarion:** Poor fools. They actually think Cazador will save them...

**Astarion:** They're no threat to us, and they have no choice but to do Cazador's bidding. I pity them. Worst of all, they don't know their fate's already set. They're doomed.

**Astarion:** The only question is whether their lives will be sacrificed to a monster like Cazador or serve a greater purpose. Seven sigils on seven spawn, and Cazador has the other six. We have to face him and take that power for ourselves.

**Astarion:** And it's not like they're sweet innocents: they brought Cazador just as many victims as I did. You're not getting sentimental, are you? I thought you were with me on this.

---

## Alternative Reflection: Temptation and Freedom

*If the player questions whether they're walking into a trap:*

**Astarion:** And spend every day looking over my shoulder? Waiting for someone to grab me and drag me back to the shadows? No, I won't spend eternity as a fugitive. I need to end this. Besides, I'll need something to protect me from the sun if things don't work out with our parasite friends. This ritual could set me free.

**Astarion:** And you want what's best for me, surely?

*If romanced:*

**Astarion:** Then you'll help me in this. Nothing would make me happier.

*If not romanced:*

**Astarion:** I knew I was right about you. You're a true friend.

**Astarion:** And now that we know he's skulking beneath his palace, we can take the hunt to Cazador.

## Contemplating Ascension

*Astarion reflects on what Dalyria and Petras revealed:*

**Astarion:** Still though, a living vampire...

**Astarion:** Who wouldn't be interested? It's the ultimate freedom. Freedom from the hunger, freedom to live a real life in the sun - no tadpole required. And if I were to ascend instead of him: freedom from Cazador, once and for all.

*If Astarion knows the ritual requires him as sacrifice:*

**Astarion:** Perhaps, but it's a devils' deal. They always have some loophole or another. And just think - I could rid myself of the mind flayers' parasite without losing anything. In fact, I'd be more powerful than ever. More powerful than any vampire has ever been.

*Alternative concern - if player points out the cost:*

**Astarion:** It comes with a cost, yes. All great things do.

*Or if uncertain:*

**Astarion:** Well, it might be. And there's only one way to find out.

*Or if skeptical it's real:*

**Astarion:** It doesn't feel like a lie. It feels like exactly the kind of power Cazador would chase.

**Astarion:** Perhaps, but if I don't confront him some day, I know I'll spend the rest of my life running from him. And if I can take this power from him, it would set me free. Truly free. I have to know. I have to face him.

## Closing

**Astarion:** All right, let's go. This place stinks of rat blood and despair.
