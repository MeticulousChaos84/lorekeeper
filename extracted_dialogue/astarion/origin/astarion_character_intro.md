**Astarion:** Hello, darling. Don't be shy, I promise not to bite until we've been formally introduced.

My name's Astarion, and I've spent a century stalking the night, hunting for pretty morsels just like you. A man called Cazador made me what I am, kept me like a pet, and forced me to do his bidding. No more.

The tadpole's influence broke his dominance over me, and now I can finally pursue the one thing I've hungered for these long, dark years. Revenge.

I'm going back to Baldur's Gate, to track Cazador down in his lair. I'll be the last thing the bastard ever sees.
