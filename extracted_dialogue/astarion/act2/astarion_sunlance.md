# Astarion: Sun Lance Incident

**Context:** Astarion confronts you after being killed/incinerated by the Sunlance and subsequently revived.

---

**Astarion:** What in the sweet hells were you thinking, activating that lance? I was right there!

**Astarion:** Gods, do you have any idea how much that hurt?

## Alternative Response Path 1: Apologetic

**Astarion:** *Next time?* No no no, if there is a 'next time', I'll be the one aiming the all-powerful weapon, thank you.

**Astarion:** Although I do appreciate you trying to fix your mistake. Just don't do it again.

---

## Alternative Response Path 2: Defensive

**Astarion:** Excuse me? That was the least you could do after dropping a building on me!

**Astarion:** Next time just warn me before you do something stupid. At least then I can get out of the blast radius. **[-5 approval]**

## Alternative Response Path 3: Questioning the Parasite Protection

**Astarion:** Well, apparently there's a limit. Somewhere between a nice summer's day and the full, concentrated power of the sun.

**Astarion:** Next time just warn me before you do something stupid. At least then I can get out of the blast radius. **[-5 approval]**

## Conversation Continues

**Astarion:** Now shall we go? Or do you have any other chaos you need to unleash here?
