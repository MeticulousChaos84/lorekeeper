# Astarion: Blood Merchant Aftermath (Act 2)

*After the encounter with Araj Oblodra, the drow blood merchant.*

---

**Astarion:** I can still taste that vile drow in my throat.

**Astarion:** I hope you're all right.

**Astarion:** I don't know what I am.

**Astarion:** Throwing your body at someone becomes second nature. And I just did it again.

**Astarion:** Throwing your body at someone becomes second nature. And I just did it again.

**Astarion:** It was your choice.

**Astarion:** Yes it was.

**Astarion:** I shouldn't have pushed you to bite her.

**Astarion:** It's all right. I didn't expect myself to feel anything.

**Astarion:** *I forced myself to bite her.*

**Astarion:** I'm so used to my body being used as a tool to get what someone else wants. But I'm free now. It shouldn't be like that.

**Astarion:** I'm sorry. I don't want you to do anything you don't want to do.

**Astarion:** So you say.

**Astarion:** I've seduced people who repulsed me more times than I can count.

**Astarion:** It should've just been another moment of disgust for greater reward.

**Astarion:** And you pushed me.

**Astarion:** I'm sorry.

**Astarion:** Huh. We shouldn't be involved with each other any more. I'll sleep alone.<br>

**Player:** I only had our best interests at heart.

**Player:** Will you please stop whining?

**Astarion:** You make your own choices now - for better or worse.

**Astarion:** *What a novel idea!*

**Astarion:** I didn't expect it to bother you at all.

**Astarion:** I didn't think twice when the moment came, but now I can't get it off my mind.

**Player:** You can still throw your body at me, any time.

**Astarion:** I'm sure I can take your mind off her...

**Astarion:** Really? After something like that, you think that's what I'm looking for?

**Astarion:** I was just defiled by that creature, and you let it happen. You made it happen!

**Astarion:** It was worth it for that potion.

**Astarion:** For you maybe.

**Astarion:** I want to thank you.

**Astarion:** For what?

**Astarion:** For what you said while I was in front of that vile drow.

**Astarion:** I spent two hundred years using my body to lure pretty things back for my Master. What I wanted, how I felt about what I was doing, it never mattered.

**Astarion:** You could have asked me to do the same - to throw myself at her, what I wanted be damned. But you didn't. And I'm grateful.

**Astarion:** I don't want you to do anything you don't want to do.

**Astarion:** It's a novel concept, I admit. And a little intimidating.

**Astarion:** It would have been so easy to bite her. To just go along with what I was being told to do.

**Astarion:** A moment of disgust to force myself through. And then I could have carried on, just like before.

**Astarion:** That would've been wrong.

**Astarion:** The entire reason for my existence was to seduce anything with a pulse.

**Astarion:** And every instinct I have tells me that nothing's changed. That I'm still just a means to an end.

**Astarion:** You made me see I never stopped thinking like I was still his slave, even in freedom.

**Astarion:** But I'm more than that. More than a thing to be used.

**Astarion:** I care about you.

**Astarion:** Really?

**Astarion:** *Open your mind so he sees you care.*

**Astarion:** *Hug him.*

**Astarion:** You... you are full of surprises, aren't you?

**Astarion:** You... you are full of surprises, aren't you?

**Astarion:** You... you are full of surprises, aren't you?

**Astarion:** Honestly, I have no idea what we're doing. Or what comes next.

**Astarion:** But I know that this? This is nice.

**Astarion:** But I know that this? This is nice.

**Astarion:** But I know that this? This is nice.

**Astarion:** *Hug him.*

**Astarion:** You are worth a great deal to me, no matter what you are going through.

**Astarion:** We can be together without sleeping together, for as long as you need.

**Astarion:** Hah! Why that almost sounds like a challenge.

**Astarion:** *What do you want to do?*

**Astarion:** I... don't know. It's been so long since I've had to decide what I wanted.

**Astarion:** Maybe what you really need is a friend, not a lover.

**Astarion:** I- I would like that.

**Astarion:** I've held more people than I can count. An infinite parade of lovers.

**Astarion:** But a friend? I can't think of a single one.

**Astarion:** Until you.

**Astarion:** Until you.

**Astarion:** Until you.

**Astarion:** Until you.

**Astarion:** Until you.

**Astarion:** Until you.

**Astarion:** It might be better if we don't see each other anymore.

**Astarion:** *It's a shame, but I don't want to risk treating you like you were one of his victims.*

**Astarion:** I slept with you because I wanted some fun, not to deal with this.

**Astarion:** *Yes. I suppose there's not much point in me if I won't have sex. My only talent, I'm fully aware.*

**Astarion:** Perhaps it's better if we don't continue with whatever this was. Perhaps we'll both be better for it.

**Astarion:** How often were you disgusted by your targets?

**Astarion:** I tried to pick beautiful people where I could, but there were so many over the years. After a while you stop caring.

**Astarion:** Just repressed it and moved on? Sounds healthy.

**Astarion:** It's easy to judge a situation when you're not in it.

**Astarion:** So why sleep with me? Did you think you'd get something from it?

**Astarion:** Of course, I needed protection.

**Astarion:** People don't trust vampires - perhaps understandably - so I needed to get someone on my side. And seducing you was easy, frankly.

**Astarion:** So imagine how stupid I felt when I started to genuinely feel something for you.

**Astarion:** Trust me, I was not happy about it. You were a complication I didn't see coming. And yet...

**Astarion:** Are you getting sentimental on me?

**Astarion:** Oh, don't look at me like that. I'm as surprised as you are.

**Astarion:** It's just... it would have been so easy to bite her. To just go along with what I was being told to do.

**Astarion:** You make your own choices now - for better or worse.

**Astarion:** It's been so long since I've had to make these decisions for myself. I won't lie, it's a daunting prospect.

**Astarion:** I was hoping that as reward for my support you'd throw yourself at me.

**Astarion:** I- I'm not sure if I should.

**Astarion:** I don't think I want you to think of me in terms of sex.

**Astarion:** I don't know if I want anyone to.

**Astarion:** How do you want me to see you?

**Astarion:** As a person? Would that be so much to ask?

**Astarion:** Are you not attracted to me? Is that it?

**Astarion:** Of course I am - look at you!

**Astarion:** You're a vision. And you're so much more than that.

**Astarion:** ...I don't know what to think. I don't know what I want.

**Astarion:** I'm not like all the others, I promise.

**Astarion:** I suppose it has felt different with you...

**Astarion:** I suppose... If this is what you want, then I shall provide.

**Astarion:** *Sigh.*

**Astarion:** *Sigh.*

**Astarion:** Are you all right? What's wrong?

**Astarion:** If you have something to say, say it.

**Astarion:** Don't tell me it was bad for you?

**Astarion:** It's almost funny.

**Astarion:** This is all a game to you, isn't it?

**Astarion:** No matter what I say, it doesn't matter. Not if you get what you want.

**Astarion:** No matter what I say, it doesn't matter. Not if you get what you want.

**Astarion:** *Of course not, it hurts to even hear you say that.*

**Astarion:** I'm so sorry.

**Astarion:** Well, you got what you wanted. An apology doesn't mean much at this point.

**Astarion:** But you seemed like you were enjoying it last night?

**Astarion:** Of course I did, I know that dance better than anyone. But I always felt nothing.

**Astarion:** Not last night, though. Last night I felt miserable, and it was a revelation.

**Astarion:** For as long as I can remember, I've been used by others. Controlled and puppeted for someone else's pleasure. But not anymore.

**Astarion:** For as long as I can remember, I've been used by others. Controlled and puppeted for someone else's pleasure. But not anymore.

**Astarion:** For as long as I can remember, I've been used by others. Controlled and puppeted for someone else's pleasure. But not anymore.

**Astarion:** *Whatever we had - whatever this was - it's over.*

**Astarion:** Why the Hells did you agree to sleep with me, then?

**Astarion:** I didn't know how to say no.

**Astarion:** But I do now.

**Player:** You should learn to enjoy sex for your own pleasure, and you should enjoy it with me.

**Player:** Come, lie with me, you'll feel better about it then.

**Astarion:** I regret stopping you. That potion would've really helped.

**Astarion:** It's a game I'm tired of playing. Being used.

**Astarion:** I thought I could bear sleeping with you, to try and get you on my side.

**Astarion:** Now I couldn't stand to do it again.

**Astarion:** *For being so wonderful in bed?*

**Astarion:** For having such delectable blood?

**Astarion:** You're welcome?

**Astarion:** Not interested.

**Astarion:** Unfortunate, because you're going to hear it.

**Astarion:** You stood up for me earlier, when that wretched drow was insisting I bite her. I appreciated it, that's all.

**Astarion:** Still not interested.

**Astarion:** Still not interested.

**Astarion:** Still not interested.

**Astarion:** Still not interested.

**Astarion:** Excuse me? This might be the first honest thing I've ever told you and you're 'not interested'?

**Astarion:** It seems I was wrong about you. About us.

**Astarion:** Do you have a moment? I think we need to talk.

**Astarion:** About your undying love for me?

**Astarion:** Something like that. Except... not that at all.

**Astarion:** Are you all right?

**Astarion:** Oh yes, I'm fine. I just-... feel awful.

**Astarion:** Look, I had a plan. A nice, simple plan - seduce you, sleep with you, manipulate your feelings so you'd never turn on me.

**Astarion:** It was easy - instinctive. Habits from two hundred years of charming people kicked in. All you had to do was fall for it.

**Astarion:** And all I had to do was not fall for you... Which is where my nice, simple plan fell apart.

**Astarion:** You -... you're incredible. You deserve something real. I want us to be something real.

**Astarion:** So do I. More than anything.

**Astarion:** I just don't know what 'real' looks like. Not after two hundred years playing the rake.

**Astarion:** So the nights we spent together didn't mean anything?

**Astarion:** Of course they did - that's the problem! Or part of it.

**Astarion:** *Being close to someone - any kind intimacy - was something I performed to lure people back for him.*

**Astarion:** Even though I know things between us are different, being with someone still feels... tainted. Still brings up those feelings of disgust and loathing.

**Astarion:** I don't know how else to be with someone. No matter how much I'd like to.

**Player:** I care about you. Deeply.

**Astarion:** Were you even attracted to me? Or was it all a lie?

**Astarion:** Of course I was attracted to you. Look at you, for goodness' sake!

**Astarion:** *How dare you! We're done.*

**Astarion:** I - yes, all right. I can understand.

**Astarion:** This doesn't sound good.

**Astarion:** Oh it's nothing terrible, it's just-... well, maybe it is a little terrible.

**Player:** I'm not interested in hearing it.
