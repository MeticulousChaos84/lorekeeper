# Astarion & Araj Oblodra: The Blood Merchant
**Location:** Moonrise Towers, Act 2
**Context:** COM moment with the Blood Merchant within Moonrise Towers

---

## Initial Encounter

**Araj Oblodra:** Araj Oblodra, trader in blood and the sanguineous arts. It is a pleasure to stand before a True Soul. And your pale companion.

**Araj Oblodra:** I'd like to offer my services, if you're willing?

**Araj Oblodra:** Put plainly - I'd like your blood. A vial of *True Soul's* blood, specifically.

### Alternative: Asking About Her Trade

**Araj Oblodra:** Please, you think someone in my line of work wouldn't recognise a vampire spawn when they see one? I trade in blood and the potions that can be wrung from it. I'm more than happy to make you one, if you'd honour me with your blood.

### The Blood Deal

**Araj Oblodra:** With one drop, I can brew a rather potent potion for you. The rest, I keep for myself.

**Araj Oblodra:** No idea! But it will be unique to you - your blood essence and the Absolute's blessing intertwined. We can learn exactly what that means together, hm?

**Araj Oblodra:** Research, naturally. A little experimentation, perhaps - I have an innate curiosity for all things sanguine.

### If the Player Agrees to Sell Blood

**Araj Oblodra:** Just a little prick and it's all over. Close your eyes.

**Araj Oblodra:** A little pain for a lot of gold. And...

**Araj Oblodra:** There we are. All of your very best traits in a bottle. Use it well!

## Araj's Interest in Astarion

**Araj Oblodra:** Although perhaps there's one more thing we could discuss: your friend. He's a vampire, no? Or one of their spawn, at least.

*[Or if she hadn't revealed this earlier:]*

**Araj Oblodra:** Although perhaps there's one more thing we could discuss: your vampiric friend.

**Astarion:** Don't worry, we're all friends under the Absolute. I won't bite.

**Araj Oblodra:** Oh I'd prefer if you did. I assume he belongs to you?

**Araj Oblodra:** I'm sure he really believes that. How utterly adorable.

*[Or alternatively:]*

**Araj Oblodra:** Ah, it's like that.

**Araj Oblodra:** Do you have a name, spawn?

**Astarion:** Astarion, but hold on-

**Araj Oblodra:** Good. Now, Astarion, I've dreamt of being bitten by a vampire since I was a young girl.

**Astarion:** I'm sorry? You want to be bitten?

**Araj Oblodra:** To feel your life's blood slipping away? To dance on the edge between life and death? Yes, I want it. I'll even compensate you - a potion of legendary power that forever increases the strength of the one who consumes it. It's not for sale, but it's yours if you bite me.

**Astarion:** I will have to decline.

**Araj Oblodra:** Excuse me? This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and you're squandering it.

**Astarion:** I gave you my answer.

**Araj Oblodra:** Can't you talk some sense into your obstinate charge?

## Supporting Astarion's Decision

**Araj Oblodra:** How very disappointing.

**Astarion:** Thank you. I appreciated that.

## Alternative: Private Conversation with Astarion

*[If the player questions why Astarion declined:]*

**Astarion:** I'm sorry, but could you excuse us a moment?

**Astarion:** Are you actually asking me to do this? Trading me for some potion? Because there's something wrong with her blood. I can smell it from here - it's rank.

**Astarion:** I can't say, it just smells wrong. Unnatural. Drinking it wouldn't kill me, but it would not be pleasant.

**Araj Oblodra:** I don't have all day, True Soul.

**Astarion:** All right. Thank you.

**Astarion:** It's still a no, I'm afraid.

**Araj Oblodra:** How very disappointing.

**Astarion:** Thank you. I appreciated that.

## If Returning After First Visit

**Araj Oblodra:** Welcome back, True Soul. I read about your kind for so many years, but never thought I'd find one in real life. And to find such a fine specimen...

*[Or if the player sold blood previously:]*

**Araj Oblodra:** I never thought I'd see one in real life... I read about your kind for so many years, but you are a finer specimen than any bestiary could describe. You're *really* a vampire? At least one of their spawn...

## Trading Only

**Araj Oblodra:** Come back any time.
