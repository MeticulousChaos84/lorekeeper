# Vampire Reveal (Act 2 Fallback)

*This fallback conversation triggers if Astarion hasn't revealed his vampirism by the time the party reaches the Creche, Underdark, or Shadow-Cursed Lands.*

## The Reveal

**Astarion:** You know, I've been thinking. And I think there's something I should tell you. Nothing big or terrible, just a small little detail about me that hasn't come up naturally. It's just that I happen to be a - what's the best way to put this? A vampire?

**Astarion:** Well... yes. Obviously. Right. Well. Glad we got that out of the way. So... was there anything else?

*Alternative response:*

**Astarion:** But you've been walking in the sun this whole time. And by rights I should be cinders blowing in the wind, but something's protecting me. The same something that's kept us from turning into mind flayers, no doubt. But that's neither here nor there. What matters is everything's out in the open now. Because we trust each other.

*If you reassure him:*

**Astarion:** We are a team. We need each other. Exactly! I knew I could rely on you. Just like you can rely on me. Now, was there anything else?

*If you express doubt but don't reject him:*

**Astarion:** I absolutely, categorically do not trust you. Hmm. Well, I suppose I can't fault you there. Trust I don't want to be torn apart and reborn a mind flayer, then. Because this arrangement is my best chance to avoid that. That I can believe. Then that will do. Now, was there anything else?

*If you question whether to trust him:*

**Astarion:** And I should just trust you not to bite me? Well, we've made it this far without anyone sinking their teeth into anyone else.

*If you've slept together:*

**Astarion:** The occasional night of passion aside.

**Astarion:** But you can trust me. Of course you can - we're a team!

*Alternative if you give him another chance:*

**Astarion:** All right, but you have one chance, vampire. Mess up and you're gone. I shall be the very model of virtue, cross my heart and hope to - ...uh. I'll be good. I promise.

*If you've slept together and he's pleading his case:*

**Astarion:** Things haven't really changed - I'm still the same sweet, loveable rogue. My smile is just a little... sharper. Did our night together mean nothing to you? And if nothing else, think of what's ahead. We need each other if we're going to survive this.
