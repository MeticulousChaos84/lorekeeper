# Astarion: Black Mass Aftermath (Vampire Spawn Path)

**Location:** Camp
**Trigger:** Long rest after Cazador's defeat, where Astarion chose to remain a vampire spawn

---

## Opening

**Astarion:** I should probably start getting used to the shadows again. Who knows how long I have left in the sun?

## Conversation

*[This is a branching conversation. Below is Astarion's dialogue from the vampire spawn path, with player choices indicated in brackets.]*

*[Player: Don't say that - we could still find a way to control the tadpole.]*

**Astarion:** Maybe, but even if I could control it, it's a dangerous game.

**Astarion:** I'd spend every day waiting for something to go wrong. For the tadpole to find some new trick, reassert itself, and make me a slave again.

*[Player: You did the right thing, stopping the Black Mass.]*

**Astarion:** I know. That doesn't mean it stings any less.

*[Player: Regretting your choices?]*

**Astarion:** No, I made the right choice. Although I do regret the options I had.

*[Player: I'm surprised you didn't go through with the ritual. I was sure you were a power-hungry madman.]*

**Astarion:** I'm glad I still have the power to surprise you. Even if it's the only power I have left.

**Astarion:** Maybe never seeing the sun again is just the price of freedom.

*[Player: I'll be with you either way. I hope you know that.]*

**Astarion:** I think I do.

**Astarion:** Assuming we survive, of course. Because a horrible death is always just around the corner with you.

*[Player: And if it is? Can you live with that?]*

**Astarion:** I'll have to. But that doesn't mean I have to like it.

**Astarion:** There's... something I'd like to show you, if that's all right? Something out in the city.

*[Player: Of course, lead on.]*

**Astarion:** This way. It's not far.

**Astarion:** Nearly two hundred years and I never came back. Not since the night I woke up down there.

**Astarion:** I had to punch a hole in the coffin and claw my way through six feet of dirt.

**Astarion:** Then when I finally broke the surface, retching up dirt and congealed blood, Cazador was waiting.

**Astarion:** From that day on I was his. Until today.

*[Player: You were never his. Whatever he had, he took by force.]*

**Astarion:** Maybe, but he did take it. There's almost nothing left of the person I was. Just a name on a rock.

*[Player: How does it feel to be free?]*

**Astarion:** Exhilarating. Terrifying. Exhausting.

**Astarion:** For nearly two centuries I stalked the streets like a ghost while the person I was lay here, dead and buried.

**Astarion:** Now I need to figure out who I am. What I want.

*[Player: You're the person I love. The person I want.]*

**Astarion:** I feel the same.

**Astarion:** You were by my side through all of this. Through bloodlust and pain and misery. You were patient. You cared. You trusted me when that was an objectively stupid thing to do.

**Astarion:** I feel safe with you. Seen. And whatever the future holds for me, I don't want to lose that.

*[Player: You won't. Whatever comes next, I've got you.]*

**Astarion:** Thank you.

**Astarion:** Well. I should probably fix this.

**Astarion:** I've been dead in the ground for long enough. It's time to try living again.

**Astarion:** With everything that life has to offer.

*[Player: I'd love to be closer to you, Astarion, but until my heart is fixed, it's too dangerous.]*

**Astarion:** And here I thought I was the dangerous one. But I'm not so frightening after all, am I?

**Astarion:** That's... interesting. I might even say I like it. And as for you and me, well, I'm willing to wait.

*[Player: What did you have in mind?]*

**Astarion:** A great deal. But nothing I can act on without burning to a crisp. But I'm willing to wait.

*[Player: Meaning...?]*

**Astarion:** If a night of passion is on offer, I could be persuaded.

*[Player: Sounds good to me.]*

**Astarion:** You know, I didn't care for you when we first met.

**Astarion:** But I do now. Being with you is about more than lust or manipulating you into a tactical alliance.

**Astarion:** I love you. I love this. And I want it all.

*[Player: I think I need a little time, honestly.]*

*[Player: On your grave? Absolutely not!]*

**Astarion:** We don't have to rush into anything tonight.

**Astarion:** We might not have forever, but we do have all the time we need.

**Astarion:** Unless we die horribly tomorrow. Which is always a strong possibility.

**Astarion:** Come on, let's get back to the camp. Who knows how long before the others go feral without us there to guide them?

**Astarion:** Come on, let's get back to the camp. If a night of passion isn't on the cards, a night of rest would be very, very welcome.

*[Player: Oh? Do you want a little fun?]*

**Astarion:** I guess that depends on what your idea of 'a little fun' is.

*[Player: I thought you'd never ask.]*

*[Player: Let's just... stay here? Together?]*

**Astarion:** Of course. That... that would mean a lot.

*[Player: *Pick up a flower and lay it on the grave.*]*

*[Player: So... what's next?]*

**Astarion:** That's the question, isn't it?

*[Player: Then don't mess it up.]*

**Astarion:** I will endeavour to please.

*[Player: That sounds very sincere. Are you sure the parasite hasn't chewed through your brain?]*

**Astarion:** If it has, it might be for the best.

*[Player: And what do you want?]*

**Astarion:** You... I want you.

*[Player: You're not out of the woods yet - we still have the parasites to deal with.]*

**Astarion:** Oh, I hadn't forgotten. But with you here, I am... dare I say 'optimistic' about our chances?

*[Player: The bastard got what was coming to him.]*

**Astarion:** It doesn't wipe away the stain he left on the world, though.

*[Player: A little stereotypical, don't you think?]*

**Astarion:** Perhaps, but some things are classics for a reason.

*[Player: Are we here to piss on someone's grave?]*

**Astarion:** The enthusiasm is appreciated, but hopefully not.

**Astarion:** You couldn't wait ten seconds before being an absolute freak?

*[Player: What is it?]*

**Astarion:** Something I haven't shown anyone else.

*[Player: If you want to sneak off for a cuddle, you can just ask.]*

**Astarion:** I'll try to restrain myself if you do. Shall we?

*[Player: That's it? You're giving up on walking in the sun?]*

**Astarion:** Less giving up, more reassessing what I want. What I *really *want.

**Astarion:** I thought things would feel different when he was gone. That I'd be revelling in my freedom.

**Astarion:** Instead I just feel... blank? I suppose not wielding the blade myself makes a difference. It's all a little anti-climactic.

**Astarion:** Cazador took up so much room in my life - my memories of him, my need for revenge. Now there's just a blank space where he used to be.

*[Player: Maybe that's the space you need to build your own life.]*

**Astarion:** Assuming I have a life to build. It's a little hard to plan anything knowing there's still a tadpole burrowing its way through your brain.

*[Player: Defining yourself by the worst people in your life sounds kind of messed up.]*

**Astarion:** Perhaps. But it'd be worse again to pretend it never happened.

**Astarion:** Of course now that I'm free from one threat, we'll have to face the other: the tadpoles that let me walk in the light.

**Astarion:** Controlling them may still be an option, but it's a dangerous game.

**Astarion:** I'd live with the risk of something going wrong. Of the tadpole finding some new trick, reasserting itself, and making me a slave again.

*[Player: I'm not sorry I killed him.]*

**Astarion:** No, I don't expect you to be. You did what you thought was right. Even if you were objectively wrong.

*[Player: So why not focus on the tadpoles? They're our biggest problem.]*

**Astarion:** The only reason I can still walk in the day, you mean? Yes, we will have to do something about them.
