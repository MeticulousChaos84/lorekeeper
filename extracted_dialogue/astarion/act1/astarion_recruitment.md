# Astarion's Recruitment: The Ambush at the Grove

**Location:** Wilderness, near the Druid Grove
**Act:** 1
**Participants:** Astarion, Player (potentially Gale if in party)
**Triggers:** Following trail of whispered calls ("Psst. Over here!" "Come on, before it's too late!")

---

**Astarion:** Hurry, I've got one of those brain things cornered. *(runs toward a patch of tall grass, peering into it)*

**Astarion:** There, in the grass. You can kill it, can't you? Like you killed the others. *(steps behind the player to offer a clear view and points)*

**Astarion:** There, can you see it?

**Narrator:** *(The player approaches the grass cautiously. A shape moves, and then - with a squeal - a boar bursts out and runs off)*

## Alternative Path 1: Seeing the Dagger (Successful Perception Check)
---

**Narrator:** *Just a dumb boar. You're relieved, until you see the flash of a dagger.* *(Player recovers after the shock of seeing the boar, and Astarion is revealed to be creeping up behind them with a dagger.)*

**Astarion:** Don't we? I saw you on the ship - free, scuttling about. You're in league with them, aren't you? Those tentacled - argh.

**Narrator:** *Your mind twists. You're looking out of unfamiliar eyes, prowling dark, busy streets.*

**Narrator:** *You try to hold the memory, but it fades to the worm. The light. The fear.*

**Astarion:** What was that? What's going on? *(groggy. The knife is still near your throat, but it dips, giving you an opening to do something)*

**Narrator:** *(Astarion lets the player up and they stand facing each other)*

**Astarion:** You're not one of them. They took you, just the same as me. And to think I was ready to decorate the ground with your innards. Apologies.

**Astarion:** Ah, a kindred spirit.

## Alternative Path 2: Held at Knifepoint (Failed Perception Check)
---

**Narrator:** *(Player doesn't notice Astarion creeping up behind them)*

**Astarion:** Shh. Not a sound. Not if you want to keep that darling neck of yours.

**Gale:** Couldn't agree more. But if you use that knife, I will incinerate you. *(if Gale is in party)*

**Astarion:** And your friend with me? Hardly.

**Astarion:** Now, I saw you on the ship, didn't I? Nod.

**Astarion:** Splendid. And now you're going to tell me exactly what you and those tentacled freaks did to me.

**Astarion:** Don't lie to me! I - agh.

**Narrator:** *Your mind twists. You're looking out of unfamiliar eyes, prowling dark, busy streets.*

**Narrator:** *You try to hold the memory, but it fades to the worm. The light. The fear.*

**Astarion:** What was that? What's going on? *(groggy. The knife is still near your throat, but it dips, giving you an opening to do something)*

**Astarion:** You're not one of them. They took you, just the same as me. And to think I was ready to decorate the ground with your innards. Apologies.

**Astarion:** Ah, a kindred spirit.

## Introduction and Recruitment
---

**Astarion:** My name's Astarion. I was in Baldur's Gate when those beasts snatched me.

**Astarion:** A pleasure.

**Astarion:** So do you know anything about these worms?

**Astarion:** Turn us into - ha. Hahaha! Of course it'll turn me into a monster. What else did I expect? Although it hasn't happened yet. If we can find an expert - someone that can control these things - there might still be time.
