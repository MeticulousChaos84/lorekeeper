# Raphael's Orthon Deal

**Context:** Raphael visited Astarion at camp and offered to help decipher his scars in exchange for killing the Orthon.

**Astarion:** It's curious, I had a visit from our impish friend Raphael last night. He wanted to talk about my scars. Or rather, he wanted to dangle the promise of talking about my scars in front of me - *if* we kill that monster of his.

*The player can express various reactions - surprise at sleeping through the visit, concern about making deals without consultation, or simply agree to help. Astarion responds with confidence and a touch of amusement.*

**Astarion:** You're talking about a vampire and a devil, darling. We're both rather good at sneaking about in the dark. It's not a deal, strictly speaking - more of a gentleman's agreement. 'I scratch your back, you read mine.' Excellent! I knew you wouldn't baulk at a challenge. And now all that's left to do is... well, find this damned thing and kill it.
