# Astarion - The Tasting Party

**Context:** Astarion is staring at the other companions around the campfire. He's friendly and affable, but his mind is on his hunger. He starts to wonder what the others taste like, although he's MOSTLY joking. In the end he decides to remove himself, before the conversation gets too real.

## If the player didn't let him feed

**Astarion:** You know, I was just thinking about you. Remembering our little encounter in the night. The very same. It obviously put me off your neck, but now I can't help but wonder how the others taste.

*Or:*

**Astarion:** You can rest easy, I don't intend a repeat performance. Although I do wonder how the others might taste.

*Or:*

**Astarion:** And I am very grateful. It did get me thinking about the others, though. How they might taste.

**Astarion:** Not that anyone's volunteered, it's just an idle fancy. We still need them. That doesn't stop me from wondering, of course.

## If the player let him feed

**Astarion:** There you are, I was just thinking about you. And that delicious moment we shared the other night. The very same. I've had this condition for two centuries, but truth be told? You were my first.

*Or:*

**Astarion:** Pity, you're tastier than you know. And you were my first.

*Or (if the player had to fight him off):*

**Astarion:** Yes, I'm still rather tender, now that you mention it. I admit, I may have been a little eager. But can you blame me? You were my first.

*Or (if he killed the player):*

**Astarion:** And I am deeply sorry. I was overeager - but can you blame me? You were my first.

**Astarion:** In all these years, I've only ever fed on beasts. Drinking the blood of thinking creatures is a different thing entirely. You were delectable. And now I just can't help but wonder how the others taste. Alas. It doesn't hurt to ponder the question, though.

*Or:*

**Astarion:** You're a sweetheart, but you don't need to worry - I'm just thinking out loud.

*Or:*

**Astarion:** Don't worry, there's enough of me to go around. I'm a man of tremendous appetites.

## The Tasting Party

**Astarion:** I don't think they'd volunteer, of course, but it doesn't make me any less curious.

### If Astarion has drunk Gale's blood

**Astarion:** I'm all too familiar with Gale's blood, unfortunately. I can't recommend it.

### If Astarion hasn't drunk Gale's blood

**Astarion:** Take Gale, for example. He strikes me as someone whose blood is rich, refined like a well-aged brandy.

### Karlach variations

**Astarion:** But Karlach? A tiefling seasoned by hellsfire? What could she possibly taste like? Something potent, I'm sure. A smoky Waterdeep whiskey?

*Or:*

**Astarion:** Take Karlach, for example, her blood aged in the Hells. She's potent, like a fiery whiskey.

### Wyll

**Astarion:** Take Wyll, for example. A man of the people, very palatable, like a sweet cider.

*Or:*

**Astarion:** And Wyll? Well, I'm not quite sure. How do you think he'd taste? He has a good heart. I'm sure he tastes sweet as any cider.

### Shadowheart

**Astarion:** Take Shadowheart, for example. She strikes me as having a heavy, enigmatic flavour - vintage port on two legs.

*Or:*

**Astarion:** But Shadowheart? I have no idea. How do you think our little enigma would taste? Something that could lay you out. Calishite Absinthe, maybe?

### Lae'zel

**Astarion:** But the gith? What in the hells would she taste like? Something exotic, surely? An Amnan liqueur?

## The Theoretical Question

**Astarion:** Yes, heavens forbid we'd have an interesting conversation. Still, I am intrigued by the possibilities...

**Astarion:** Absolutely. A mere thought experiment.

*Or:*

**Astarion:** Relax, we're just talking.

**Astarion:** So - in the spirit of theoretical questions - if you had to take a bite from one of them, who would it be?

**Astarion:** Oh no, don't be disgusting. I just mean a sip of their blood. No mastication required.

### If player chooses Gale

**Astarion:** Ah, a refined palate! I can't disagree.

### If player chooses Lae'zel

**Astarion:** Mmm, a meal that would put up a fight. An adventurous choice.

### If player chooses Shadowheart

**Astarion:** A fine choice. She is enticing.

### If player chooses Wyll

**Astarion:** Interesting. I always thought he'd taste a little too sweet.

### If player chooses Karlach

**Astarion:** A brave choice.

### If player chooses Astarion himself

**Astarion:** Oh, I'm flattered. Who knew you had such taste? Unfortunately, all this talk is getting me hungry. I'd better find something I can actually sink my teeth into.

## Ending

**Astarion:** Although the more I think on it, the hungrier I get. I'd better go find something I can actually get my teeth into.

**Astarion:** There's nothing that tasty lurking out in the woods, but I'll make do. Sweet dreams.

*Or:*

**Astarion:** Nothing out there will taste as good as the alternatives, but I'll make do. Sweet dreams.

*Or:*

**Astarion:** Don't tempt me, darling.
