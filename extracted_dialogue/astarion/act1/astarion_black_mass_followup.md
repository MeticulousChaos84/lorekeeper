# Astarion: Black Mass Follow-Up Conversations

*Conversations following the Black Mass ritual where Astarion stayed a vampire spawn*

---

## Immediate Aftermath - In the Ritual Chamber

**Astarion:** That's it. He's gone. After all these years - these centuries - it's really over.

I'm not sure. I'm just feeling a little numb. What I've lost, what I've gained - it's all so much.

And gods, all those spawn, free in the Underdark. I need some time, I think. Just to let it all sink in. Let's just go. This place reeks of death and I want to feel alive again.

**Alternative: If player killed the spawn**

**Astarion:** That's it. He's gone. After all these years - these centuries - it's really over.

I'm not sure. I'm just feeling a little numb. What I've lost, what I've gained - it's all so much.

And gods, all those spawn, dead in their cells. I need some time, I think. Just to let it all sink in. Let's just go. This place reeks of death and I want to feel alive again.

**Alternative: If player expressed pride**

**Astarion:** I'm glad you think so, because I'm not so sure. I just feel numb. What I've lost, what I've gained - it's all so much.

And gods, all those spawn, free in the Underdark. I need some time, I think. Just to let it all sink in. Let's just go. This place reeks of death and I want to feel alive again.

**Alternative: If player asked about regret**

**Astarion:** No. Well... maybe a little, but I'm not sure. What I've lost, what I've gained - it's all so much.

And gods, all those spawn, free in the Underdark. I need some time, I think. Just to let it all sink in. Let's just go. This place reeks of death and I want to feel alive again.

## Morning After - Romance Path

**Astarion:** It feels ridiculous to still be thinking about Cazador. He's gone, I'm here - I won. But I still keep reliving everything that happened. Playing it over and over in my mind.

**Alternative responses lead to:**

**Astarion:** Back at the ritual, all I could see was the power on offer and the safety it promised. I was so blinded by it. Just as Cazador was.

But you saw something in me - someone else I could be. Someone who could break the cycle of power and terror that started centuries ago.

You saved me back there. I may not have appreciated it at the time, but I do now. Thank you.

You did more than that. You believed in me - believed I was enough just the way I am.

When I look at my future, anything and everything feels possible now.

### If Previously Partnered (Now Friends)

And nice as it would have been to share this with a partner, I'm glad I get to share it with a friend.

You saved me from myself and let me walk a new path where I can be free. Truly, honestly free.

This is a gift, you know. Thank you - I won't forget it.

### If Currently Partnered

And I get to share it with you, as a partner. An equal.

You saved me from myself and let me walk a new path where I can be free. Truly, honestly free.

This is a gift, you know. Thank you - I won't forget it.

**Alternative: Discussing the ritual itself**

**Astarion:** Back at the ritual, all I could see was the power on offer and the safety it promised. I was so blinded by it. Just as Cazador was.

But you saw something in me - someone else I could be. Someone who could break the cycle of power and terror that started centuries ago.

You saved me back there. I may not have appreciated it at the time, but I do now. Thank you.

So am I. Fun as all that power would have been... this feels more 'me'.

When I look at my future, anything and everything feels possible now.

*[Continues to partnership/friendship ending as above]*

**Alternative: Uncertainty about the decision**

**Astarion:** Back at the ritual, all I could see was the power on offer and the safety it promised. I was so blinded by it. Just as Cazador was.

But you saw something in me - someone else I could be. Someone who could break the cycle of power and terror that started centuries ago.

You saved me back there. I may not have appreciated it at the time, but I do now. Thank you.

Neither was I. Not until I sank the dagger into Cazador's chest and the light went out of his eyes. I am - well, not 'happy' with how things turned out. But this does feel right.

When I look at my future, anything and everything feels possible now.

*[Continues to partnership/friendship ending as above]*

**Alternative: Discussing the other spawn (if killed)**

**Astarion:** Back at the ritual, all I could see was the power on offer and the safety it promised. I was so blinded by it. Just as Cazador was.

But you saw something in me - someone else I could be. Someone who could break the cycle of power and terror that started centuries ago.

You saved me back there. I may not have appreciated it at the time, but I do now. Thank you.

We could have tried. We could have given them the same chance I was given.

Then again, how many lives would that have cost? Even in the Underdark, they would have been dangerous.

I don't know, maybe there just weren't any good options. I only hope we picked the least bad one.

So am I. Fun as all that power would have been... this feels more 'me'.

When I look at my future, anything and everything feels possible now.

*[Continues to partnership/friendship ending as above]*

**Alternative: Accepting what's done (if spawn killed)**

**Astarion:** Back at the ritual, all I could see was the power on offer and the safety it promised. I was so blinded by it. Just as Cazador was.

No, it can't. And I can't say I'm unhappy about it either.

When I look at my future, anything and everything feels possible now.

*[Continues to partnership/friendship ending as above]*

**Alternative: Concern about player's decision (if spawn killed)**

**Astarion:** Back at the ritual, all I could see was the power on offer and the safety it promised. I was so blinded by it. Just as Cazador was.

## Morning After - Non-Romance/Friendship Path

**Astarion:** It's strange, knowing I'll never hear Cazador's voice again. Knowing it'll never command me to bow against my will. I'm free from him. Forever.

Invigorating? Terrifying? All of the above? I'm still trying to understand it, really.

I came so close to losing everything back there. To losing myself.

### Main Path

**Astarion:** Back at the ritual, all I could see was the power on offer and the safety it promised. I was so blinded by it. Just as Cazador was.

But you saw something in me - someone else I could be. Someone who could break the cycle of power and terror that started centuries ago.

This is a gift, you know. Thank you - I won't forget it.

**Alternative: Discussing regret about power**

**Astarion:** It's strange, knowing I'll never hear Cazador's voice again. Knowing it'll never command me to bow against my will. I'm free from him. Forever.

Perhaps. It would have been *terrible* fun.

But then again, I could feel something slipping away. I came so close to losing myself - losing everything I'd learned since meeting you.

*[Continues to main ending above]*

**Alternative: Discussing the ritual chamber moment**

**Astarion:** It's strange, knowing I'll never hear Cazador's voice again. Knowing it'll never command me to bow against my will. I'm free from him. Forever.

Invigorating? Terrifying? All of the above? I'm still trying to understand it, really.

You're not wrong. Cazador left his mark on me in more ways than one - for a moment, I wanted to be just like him.

I came so close to losing everything back there. To losing myself.

*[Continues to main ending above]*

**Alternative: About the other spawn (if killed)**

**Astarion:** It's strange, knowing I'll never hear Cazador's voice again. Knowing it'll never command me to bow against my will. I'm free from him. Forever.

Invigorating? Terrifying? All of the above? I'm still trying to understand it, really.

We could have tried. We could have given them the same chance I had.

I was able to go out into the world and make better choices. To go against my nature and become more than a blood-sucking monster. Maybe they would have done the same.

Or maybe not - but did we have the right to take that choice away from them?

Probably, yes. Destroying them wasn't a good solution, but maybe it was the least bad.

I suppose that's the less convenient side of freedom - having to live with the choices you made.

Back at the ritual, all I could see was the power on offer and the safety it promised. I was so blinded by it. Just as Cazador was.

But you saw something in me - someone else I could be. Someone who could break the cycle of power and terror that started centuries ago.

You saved me back there. I may not have appreciated it at the time, but I do now. Thank you.

You did more than that. You believed in me - believed I was enough just the way I am.

And nice as it would have been to share this with a partner, I'm glad I get to share it with a friend.

You saved me from myself and let me walk a new path where I can be free. Truly, honestly free.

This is a gift, you know. Thank you - I won't forget it.

**Alternative: Discussing freed spawn**

**Astarion:** It's strange, knowing I'll never hear Cazador's voice again. Knowing it'll never command me to bow against my will. I'm free from him. Forever.

Invigorating? Terrifying? All of the above? I'm still trying to understand it, really.

And nice as it would have been to share this with a partner, I'm glad I get to share it with a friend.

You saved me from myself and let me walk a new path where I can be free. Truly, honestly free.

I have to hope so. And if not, at least I gave them the same chance I was given. A chance to follow a better path. I can only hope they make the most of it.

This is a gift, you know. Thank you - I won't forget it.
