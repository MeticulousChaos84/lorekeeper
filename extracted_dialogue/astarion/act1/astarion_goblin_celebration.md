# Astarion - Goblin Celebration (Evil Path)

**Location:** Camp after siding with goblins and betraying the tieflings
**Trigger:** CAMP_GoblinHuntRaiderCelebration_CRD_Astarion
**Context:** Astarion is enjoying himself at the goblin party, drinking blood and celebrating the massacre

---

## Initial Greeting

**Astarion:** Don't you love the silence after a massacre? It's just so pure.

**Astarion:** Well hello. Welcome to my humble party. What's your poison? Red? White?

### Wine Selection

**White wine:**
**Astarion:** I'm afraid it's warm, but needs must.

**Red wine:**
**Astarion:** Ah, a good, full-bodied choice.

**Beer:**
**Astarion:** You're a conquering hero and you want to drink foaming piss? Not that I'm judging, of course.

**Water:**
**Astarion:** Your funeral.

**What are you drinking?**
**Astarion:** I'll give you red. *(chuckles - he's been drinking blood)*

---

## Toasting

**Astarion:** So, what are we drinking to? Other than a pile of corpses. *(pouring drinks, both pick up cups)*

**To victory:**
**Astarion:** To victory! *(raising glass, drinks)*

**To surviving another day:**
**Astarion:** To surviving! *(raising glass, drinks)*

**To getting rid of this tadpole:**
**Astarion:** Cheers. *(with a grunt, downbeat - he's not keen on losing the tadpole, but still toasts and drinks)*

**That's not funny:**
**Astarion:** Oh don't be so sour - it's a party. You did what you had to. Don't be ashamed that you did it well.

I wish things had turned out differently.

**Astarion:** And I wish I was drinking out of the skulls of everyone who's ever wronged me. Life is tough. Although that's not to say we can't have a little fun. *(toasts and drinks)*

or

**Astarion:** And I wish I was drinking out of Cazador's skull. Life is tough. Although that's not to say we can't have a little fun. *(toasts and drinks)*

**I'm not ashamed. I just don't feel like boasting about it:**
**Astarion:** Try it. You might have fun. To fun! *(toasts and drinks)*

**It was more a mountain of corpses than a pile:**
**Astarion:** Ha! All right, to a mountain of corpses! *(toasts and drinks)*

---

## After the Toast

**Astarion:** Mmm. Delicious. *(savoring his drink)*

---

## If Player Has Another Partner

### If with Lae'zel:
**Astarion:** So, I see Lae'zel's marked you as her territory. I just hope she leaves you in one piece. We can't take a tenday for you to recover from whatever her idea of 'fun' is.

**I'm sure I'll have a good time:**
**Astarion:** Good for you. As for me, I'm going to drink until I'm sure I won't hear you grunting in the bushes. Here's to you! *(toasts and drains cup)*

**It's nothing serious:**
**Astarion:** Ha! No, it so rarely is. But it might be fun. Here's to you! *(toasts and drains cup)*

**You're not jealous, are you?**
**Astarion:** Ha! No, my love, I'm not jealous of the beating our gith friend will give you. As for me, I'm going to drink until I know I won't hear you grunting in the bushes. Here's to you! *(toasts and drains cup)*

### If with Shadowheart:
**Astarion:** So, I see you and Shadowheart have a connection. It looks very sweet. Not what I'd call 'fun', or 'interesting', but sweet.

**I'm sure I'll have a good time:**
**Astarion:** Good for you. As for me, I'm going to drink until I'm sure I won't hear you grunting in the bushes. Here's to you! *(toasts and drains cup)*

**It's nothing serious:**
**Astarion:** Ha! No, it so rarely is. But it might be fun. Here's to you! *(toasts and drains cup)*

**You're not jealous, are you?**
**Astarion:** Ha! No, my love, you and Shadowheart can hold hands all you want. It means nothing to me. As for me, I'm going to drink until I know I won't hear you grunting in the bushes. Here's to you! *(toasts and drains cup)*

### If with Minthara (the drow):
**Astarion:** So, I see you and the drow have been making eyes at each other. She does seem like a fun romp. As long as she doesn't bite your head off halfway through the act.

**I'm sure I'll have a good time:**
**Astarion:** Good for you. As for me, I'm going to drink until I'm sure I won't hear you grunting in the bushes. Here's to you! *(toasts and drains cup)*

**It's nothing serious:**
**Astarion:** Ha! No, it so rarely is. But it might be fun. Here's to you! *(toasts and drains cup)*

**You're not jealous, are you?**
**Astarion:** Ha! No, my love, I'm not jealous of the drow. You have all the fun you want - if you survive the night. As for me, I'm going to drink until I know I won't hear you grunting in the bushes. Here's to you! *(toasts and drains cup)*

**Are you offering anything better? Because I could be persuaded:**
*(Leads to seduction path - see below)*

---

## If Player Has No Partner - Seduction

**Astarion:** So, has anyone in the camp caught your eye?

What do you mean?

**Astarion:** By the hells. Sex, my dear. A night of passion. There's no better way to unwind after a long day of killing.

**Shadowheart is looking very good tonight:**
**Astarion:** Really? Her?

**Minthara is fun:**
**Astarion:** I'm sure she is. If you can trust her not to bite your head off once you've done the deed.

**I'm tempted by Lae'zel:**
**Astarion:** Ha! You're braver than I thought.

**I was thinking about you, actually:**
*(Leads to romance path - see below)*

**No, I'll spend the night alone:**
**Astarion:** Whatever makes you happy, I suppose. As long as you don't come scratching at my door.

---

## Alternative Opening (If Met Before)

**Astarion:** Well hello. What's on your mind? *(flirty)*

### If Returning to Tell Him About Another Partner:

**Just so you know, I'm spending tonight with Lae'zel / Shadowheart / our drow host:**
**Astarion:** Are you now? Well, lucky her. Well, you have fun. I'm more than happy with my cup anyway.

---

## Astarion Romance Path (High Approval)

**Astarion:** So. What happens next? *(looking at player with lust)*

What do you mean?

**Astarion:** By the hells. Sex, my dear. A night of passion.

**What would you like to happen?**
**Astarion:** Oh, a little talking, a little drinking, and - once everyone else is asleep - we get to know each other.

**Well, I'd planned to bed you:**

### If Player Has Another Partner:
**Does Lae'zel know that?**
**Astarion:** Does Lae'zel know that? I saw how she looked at you earlier. I'd hate to get between the gith and her trophy. No, I think we'll end this evening as friends.

or

**Astarion:** Does Shadowheart know that? I saw how she looked at you earlier. I don't know what her idea of a good time is, but it seems to involve you. I'd hate to intrude.

or

**Astarion:** Does the drow know that? I saw how she looked at you earlier. Be careful with that one. Her idea of a good time probably involves biting your head off halfway through the act.

**Astarion:** Really? I thought you had other company planned this evening, and I'd hate to intrude. Watch maybe, but not intrude.

**Are you offering anything better? Because I could be persuaded:**
*(Leads to acceptance - see below)*

### If Player Has No Partner:
**Astarion:** Well, I'd hate to get in the way of a well-laid plan. So to speak.

---

## Accepting the Proposition

**Astarion:** Let's wait until things quieten down a bit. Once the others are asleep, we'll find each other.

**I'll see you later, then:**
**Astarion:** Indeed you will, my love. Indeed you will.

**On second thought, maybe we'd better not:**
**Astarion:** Never listen to your second thoughts! They always spoil the fun. But fine. If you're determined to ruin your evening, I won't stop you.

---

## If Player Flirts But He Needs More Persuasion

**Between us? Nothing:**
**Astarion:** Nothing? How can you be so cruel? Come on. There's a spark here. I know you've felt it too, darling. *(subtle and seductive, restrained flirtation)*

**There isn't. I haven't. And that's all there is to it:**
**Astarion:** I'm sorry, I mistook you for someone with taste. But have it your way. I'm happy to entertain myself.

**Maybe. If you say 'please':**
**Astarion:** What?

Say 'please'.

*[Persuasion check - DC 15]*

**[Success]:**
**Astarion:** *Please.* *(through gritted teeth)*

**No:**
**Astarion:** You insolent little- Fine. Enjoy your night with whatever goblin will have you.

**Well done! I'll see you tonight:**
**Astarion:** Cheeky little pup. I'll see you later.

**[Failure]:**
**Astarion:** You are an insolent little pup, aren't you? *(kind of amused, kind of angry)* But have it your way. I'm happy to entertain myself.

**I'm kidding. I'll see you tonight:**
**Astarion:** Cheeky little pup. I'll see you later.

**No, Astarion. It's not happening:**
**Astarion:** Suit yourself. I've more than enough company. *(said to player as they walk away, drains cup afterwards)*

---

## Low Approval Rejection

**Astarion:** I'm flattered, but I think not. It's not you, you understand, it's me. I have standards.

---

## Wine Stolen Variant

**Astarion:** What's your poison? I have - ah. *(realizes his wine's been stolen)* I'm afraid I'm all out. This party is more humble than I'd like.

*(Then continues to partner-specific dialogue or seduction path)*

---

## Return Dialogue (After Initial Conversation)

### If Already Agreed to Meet:
**Astarion:** Not quite yet, love. Let's wait until they're asleep.

### If Previously Rejected Player:
**Astarion:** Oh don't come crawling back. It's just embarrassing.

### If Player Rejected Him:
**Astarion:** If you're here to beg forgiveness, save your breath. My cup and I are perfectly happy together.

### If Just Hanging Around:
**Astarion:** Do you mind? I have a bottle to finish.

### After Drow Betrayal Event:
**Astarion:** Certainly better than pillow talk with your drow lover, hmm? *(teasing)*

**Astarion:** How about some rest? It's been quite an evening.

## Notes

- This is the **evil path** celebration - occurs only if you sided with the goblins and betrayed the tieflings
- Astarion is in an exceptionally good mood, drinking blood and celebrating freely
- High approval required for romance path (Approval_AtLeast_20_For_Sp2)
- Multiple partner scenarios (Lae'zel, Shadowheart, Minthara the drow)
- Dark Urge content excluded per extraction rules
- This leads to the iconic forest scene if romance path is chosen
