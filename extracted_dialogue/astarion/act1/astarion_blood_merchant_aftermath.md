# Astarion: Blood Merchant Aftermath

**Context:** Avatar and Astarion discuss the encounter with the Blood Merchant. This conversation branches significantly based on whether the player convinced Astarion to bite her.

## If the Player Did NOT Convince Astarion

**Astarion:** The way she leered at me... the blood merchant... I can't get it out of my head... It isn't like me. Not like me at all. I was being too precious, wasn't I? We could have used her potion. A moment of unpleasantry doesn't matter if there's a fine reward. I should have just gritted my teeth as always and let her have me for a bit.

**Astarion:** There's nothing more desirable in the world than a vampire, is there? And when you've been through all I have, you damn well are going to fight with what few assets the gods give you. But... a part of me feels sick when I think about getting on my back for breadcrumbs again.

**Astarion:** I had nothing at all for so long. Not even my body - that was owned by Cazador, to be sent out to tempt fools into his palace. I have bedded thousands of people. Half of them I barely remember. Most of them didn't even grant me temporary bliss. It should have been so easy to let the drow use me for her fantasy, but perhaps - you showed me I have enough strength - I don't *need* to.

**Astarion:** I can stop using myself. Stop being used. It isn't worth the scars, anymore.

### Alternative: Pragmatic Encouragement

**Astarion:** There's nothing more desirable in the world than a vampire, is there? And when you've been through all I have, you damn well are going to fight with what few assets the gods give you. But... a part of me feels sick when I think about getting on my back for breadcrumbs again.

**Astarion:** I had nothing at all for so long. Not even my body - that was owned by Cazador, to be sent out to tempt fools into his palace. I have bedded thousands of people. Half of them I barely remember. Most of them didn't even grant me temporary bliss. It should have been so easy to let the drow use me for her fantasy, but perhaps - you showed me I have enough strength - I don't *need* to.

**Astarion:** Well... perhaps I should see it that way, after all. It isn't humiliating to use myself as a weapon. It's degrading that people like her fall for it. Over and over again. Charm is just another spell we cast.

### Alternative: Dismissive Response

**Astarion:** The way she leered at me... the blood merchant... I can't get it out of my head... It isn't like me. Not like me at all. I was being too precious, wasn't I? We could have used her potion. A moment of unpleasantry doesn't matter if there's a fine reward. I should have just gritted my teeth as always and let her have me for a bit.

**Astarion:** Next time, I won't be so stroppy. No point not using all the assets the gods give us.

## If the Player DID Convince Astarion

**Astarion:** The way she leered at me... the blood merchant... I can't get it out of my head... I did what I always did. I let her use me. Why does it feel *different* to all the other times, then?

**Astarion:** Yes... I think something *is* wrong.

**Astarion:** There's nothing more desirable in the world than a vampire, is there? And when you've been through all I have, you damn well are going to fight with what few assets the gods give you. But... a part of me feels sick when I think about getting on my back for breadcrumbs again.

### If the Player Apologizes

**Astarion:** All the promiscuous jibes paint a picture of someone who would relish the deed... You couldn't really have known.

**Astarion:** I had nothing at all for so long. Not even my body - that was owned by Cazador, to be sent out to tempt fools into his palace. I have bedded thousands of people. Half of them I barely remember. Most of them didn't even grant me temporary bliss. I thought it would be nothing at all to sell myself to that drow's fantasies. But the price was higher than I imagined. I don't want to do it again.

**Astarion:** I can stop using myself. Stop being used. It isn't worth the scars, anymore.

### Alternative: If the Player Pushes Back

**Astarion:** I forced myself to do it. I have bedded thousands of people. Half of them I barely remember. Most of them didn't even grant me temporary bliss. I thought it would be nothing at all to sell myself to that drow's fantasies. But the price was higher than I imagined. I don't want to do it again.

**Astarion:** I can stop using myself. Stop being used. It isn't worth the scars, anymore.

### Alternative: Focusing on the Reward

**Astarion:** I'll drink that potion and never think about it again afterwards. But what I had to do to get it is going to stay...

**Astarion:** There's nothing more desirable in the world than a vampire, is there? And when you've been through all I have, you damn well are going to fight with what few assets the gods give you. But... a part of me feels sick when I think about getting on my back for breadcrumbs again.

### On Survival and Freedom

**Astarion:** I could have lived eternally in Cazador's pleasure chambers. I'm not afraid to die. I'm afraid I'll never have a new life after that.

**Notes:**
- This is a crucial character moment where Astarion begins to recognize that he has agency and doesn't need to use his body transactionally
- The conversation reveals the depth of his trauma around sexual exploitation under Cazador
- Different player responses lead to either empowerment (realizing he can stop) or reinforcement of old patterns (seeing seduction as just another tool)
- The "thousands of people" line is significant lore - 200 years of nightly exploitation
