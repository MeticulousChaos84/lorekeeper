# Monster Hunter Confirmed

**Astarion:** So, there's a monster hunter after you? Not anymore. Which is all that matters, really. Not anymore. Which is all that matters, really. That monster hunter we met in the swamp - he's looking for you, isn't he? So it would seem. Hopefully he bumps into some gnolls while stumbling around at night and that's the last we hear from him. What if he reappears? Then we kill him. I thought that would've been obvious. There may be others, of course. If Cazador sent one peon after me, he'll send more. That monster hunter you killed in the swamp - he was after you, wasn't he? He was. But now he's not, which is all that matters, really. The hunter said you were a vampire spawn... Well of course he did. 'I'm hunting a poor innocent for money' isn't exactly going to win sympathy, is it? No, 'I'm here to save you from a monstrous vampire' - that's much more convincing. But why was he hunting you? What did you do? I didn't do anything! I was kidnapped - just like you. It seems Cazador wants me back. And who is Cazador, exactly? Cazador Szarr is a vampire lord in Baldur's Gate. The patriarch of his coven and a monster obsessed with power. He turned me nearly two hundred years ago. I became his spawn and he became my tormentor. Ah, yes, you don't know. Cazador is a - a slaver in Baldur's Gate. He captured me a long time ago. Insisted I call him 'master' - I only escaped when the mind flayers snatched me away from him.
