# Astarion - Second Night Romance (Camp)

**Context:** Second time Astarion propositions the player to sleep with him - optional scene between his Act 1 and Act 2 critical path romance scenes.

This bridges the gap before he confesses this in his Act 2 romance scene.

**Location:** Camp
**Trigger:** After sleeping with Astarion the first time, can occur at the party celebration or any time before Act 2 romance scene

## Opening Proposition

**Astarion:** Here's my little treat with their cheeks all flushed. You *will* come to my bed tonight, won't you?

---

## Eager Agreement Path

**Astarion:** I'm amazed you managed to keep your mind clear enough to fight, I've been thinking about our last night together ceaselessly. I'll be in quite a spot of mortal peril if you let me keep distracting myself *dreaming* instead of doing. We can't have that, can we? It would be *very dangerous*.

---

## Seduction Attempts

**Astarion:** Oh, I certainly can, it would be my pleasure. How about this one:

### During Tiefling Celebration

**Astarion:** All these accolades from the Tieflings are *nothing* compared to the sound of my name, cried from your lips.

### During Raiders Celebration

**Astarion:** Every time I heard the Tieflings cry, I remembered how you sounded crying for me.

### Alternative Line

**Astarion:** When I'm with you, I feel practically alive, yet I crave only to die again with you.

---

## Escalating Flattery

**Astarion:** Hmm, let me give it another go: Every part of your perfect body whispers temptation - it's as if the Gods made you just to ruin me.

**Astarion:** I can go on all night with the flattery, but is that really all you want?

### If Questioned About Cazador's Targets

**Astarion:** Well, they worked on you last time, didn't they?

---

## The "I Love You" Moment

**Astarion:** How about if I said these little words... Everyone's favourite... I love you.

*(Pretends to say it very sweetly and innocently)*

### If Called Out as a Lie

**Astarion:** Ah ha, but a rather beautiful lie, nonetheless.

### If Questioned as Too Soon

**Astarion:** Well, it can be true, if only for tonight.

---

## Moving Forward

**Astarion:** Now, as much as I relish standing around and saying all my favourite lines at you, I'd much rather we got to experience each others' *full portfolio of talents* once again.

**Astarion:** I'll be waiting.

---

## Playful Banter Variations

**Astarion:** Not half as sweet as when I tasted you.

**Astarion:** I am, it's hard not to with you.

---

## If Player Mentions Spending Time with Someone Else

**Astarion:** By all means, do something less exceptional, and think of me while you're doing it. If you don't remember how much you enjoyed it last time, I would like to try again, until you can think of nothing else.

---

## If Player Defers (Not Rejection)

**Astarion:** Ah, you need a bit of enticing, let me see.

**Astarion:** I look forward to the day. Meanwhile, my hunger for you will only deepen.

---

## If Player Ends the Romance

**Astarion:** Well, well, excuse me while I die of a broken heart. In all honesty, it is a shame. That time was special to me. I've gotten on my back ten thousand times or more, and forgotten half of them. But you... you I'll remember. Have a fine evening, dear.

## Special Case: Karlach (Pre-Second Engine Upgrade)

**Astarion:** Oh I don't know. It might be worth it.

*(In response to Karlach saying she'd burn him alive)*
