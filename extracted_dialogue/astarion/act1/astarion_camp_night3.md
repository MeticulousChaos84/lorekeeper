# Astarion's Reflective Night (Pre-Bite Scene)
**Location:** Camp
**Act:** 1
**Participants:** Astarion, Player
**Triggers:** Camp conversation, third night. This scene occurs before Astarion attempts to bite the player during their sleep. He's lying on his bedroll, contemplating the stars and planning to feed later.

---

**Astarion:** Do you mind? I was rather enjoying my view of the ceiling.

or

**Astarion:** It's quite a sight.

**Astarion:** The stars, I mean. I could take or leave your chin.

**Astarion:** You seem more relaxed.

**Astarion:** I am. I've been thinking.

or

**Astarion:** Am I disturbing you?

**Astarion:** No, just thinking.

or

**Astarion:** ...Why?

**Astarion:** It's something of a novelty. I'm usually quite busy at night, but now I'm just lying here and thinking.

or

**Astarion:** Pardon, I didn't mean to disturb such important work.

**Astarion:** I'll forgive you. I'm mostly just thinking anyway.

or

**Astarion:** They are beautiful tonight.

**Astarion:** I can see the stars from Baldur's Gate, of course, but not with such clarity. It got me thinking.

## Reflecting on Finding the Druid

**Astarion:** Reflecting on what tomorrow might bring, when we find the druid.

**Astarion:** Will he know how to bring the worm under control? Will this little adventure of ours be over?

**Astarion:** It doesn't have to be. We can still travel together.

**Astarion:** Good! I don't want you to run off just yet.

**Astarion:** You're quite the ally, after all. Traversing Avernus. Surviving the crash. Surviving everything that's followed...

**Astarion:** I'm not normally impressed by people of your stature, but you're stronger than I gave you credit for. *(if Dwarf, Gnome, or Halfling)*

or

**Astarion:** I'm not easily impressed by people, but you're stronger than I gave you credit for.

***The smile on his pretty lips is a touch too composed, a bit too perfect. He may not mean a word he says.*** *(Insight check success)*

**Astarion:** Watch yourself, Astarion.

**Astarion:** Oh, you're no fun.

*Leave.*

**Astarion:** Sleep tight. I'll see you later, I'm sure. *(Called after someone walking away.)*

or

**Astarion:** Perhaps we should get to know one another better...

**Astarion:** A delicious thought, but...

**Astarion:** But? What are you waiting for?

**Astarion:** The right moment...

**Astarion:** ...I'm sorry, I - I need to clear my head.

**Astarion:** I'll see you later, I'm sure. Sleep tight. *(He's thinking about sneaking back into camp and drinking your blood tonight. Sleep tight should be said with a smirk.)*

or

**Astarion:** I'm joking. Relax.

**Astarion:** Hmm? Yes! Of course, me too.

**Astarion:** I think I'll just - just clear my head.

**Astarion:** I'll see you later, I'm sure. Sleep tight. *(He's thinking about sneaking back into camp and drinking your blood tonight. Sleep tight should be said with a smirk.)*

or

**Astarion:** Just keep your eyes away from my neck.

**Astarion:** Heavens forbid. I've learned my lesson. I just...

**Astarion:** ...I just need to get some air. Clear my head.

**Astarion:** I'll see you later, I'm sure. Sleep tight. *(He's thinking about sneaking back into camp and drinking your blood tonight. Sleep tight should be said with a smirk.)*

or

***The smile on his pretty lips is a touch too composed, a bit too perfect. He may not mean a word he says.*** *(Insight check success)*

**Astarion:** You're too close.

**Astarion:** Of course. Terribly sorry. *(Smug, quiet, he's still right in her face. He doesn't move.)*

**Astarion:** I was just going anyway. I need to clear my head. *(Smug, quiet, he's still right in her face.)*

**Astarion:** I'm sure I'll see you when I get back. Sleep tight.

or

*A waste of time. Leave.*

**Astarion:** Sleep tight. I'll see you later, I'm sure. *(Called after someone walking away.)*
