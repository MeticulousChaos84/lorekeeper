# Astarion: Camp - First Night

**Location:** Camp (Wilderness)
**Act:** 1
**Context:** The first night in camp after the nautiloid crash. Astarion is adjusting to the novelty of being awake at night but not prowling the streets - a complete reversal of his existence for the past two hundred years. The player doesn't yet know he's a vampire.

## The Novelty of Night

**Astarion:** So, we're resting here? Turning in for the night?

The night normally means bustling streets, bursting taverns. Curling up in the dirt and resting is... a little novel.

I'm in no place to rest yet. Today has been a lot. I need some time to think things through. To process this.

*He taps his temple, referring to the tadpole.*

You rest. I'll keep watch.

## If the Player Thanks Him

**Astarion:** The pleasure is all mine. Sweet dreams.

---

## If the Player Says They'll Sleep Later

**Astarion:** Suit yourself. Sweet dreams.

---

## If the Player Refuses to Sleep Near a Stranger

**Astarion:** You know, if you want to spend time with me you only have to say so.

But suit yourself. I'm sure we'll drift off at some point.

## Return Visit

**Astarion:** Do you mind? I'm brooding.

## Notes

This conversation establishes several key elements of Astarion's character:
- His unfamiliarity with camping and wilderness living (having been urban-bound in Baldur's Gate for 200 years)
- His nocturnal nature (normally "busy" at night, now forced to rest)
- His deflection about his true nature through vague language ("this is all a little new")
- Early hints of charm and flirtation
- His genuine need to process freedom after centuries of servitude

The line about tea "not being his drink" (in response to a Druid/Monk/Ranger offering herbs) is a subtle vampire hint - he only drinks blood.
