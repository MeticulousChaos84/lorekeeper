**Astarion:** Bit of a grim mood tonight. Sounds like the others don't relish the thought of sprouting tentacles.

or

**Astarion:** Your magician seems dour tonight. Must not relish the idea of sprouting tentacles.

or

**Astarion:** Your gith friend seems on edge. Mustn't relish the thought of sprouting tentacles.

or

**Astarion:** Shadowheart seems jumpy. Must not relish the thought of sprouting tentacles.

**Astarion:** Understandable. Can't say I'm a fan either. It's just hard to join in when all of this feels so new.

or

**Astarion:** So, we're resting here? Turning in for the night?

**Astarion:** I suppose. I'm not sure what I expected, really. This is all a little new.

or

**Astarion:** It's all a little new to me, I admit.

or

**Astarion:** No, I'm more than happy to put my feet up. I'm just not used to this. *(Referring to sleeping at night, camping, being out of the city - it's all new)*

**Astarion:** The night normally means bustling streets, bursting taverns.

**Astarion:** Curling up in the dirt and resting is... a little novel. *(Slightly amused)*

**Astarion:** I'm in no place to rest yet. Today has been a lot.

or

**Astarion:** I'll be awake awhile yet. Today has been a lot.

**Astarion:** I need some time to think things through. To process this. *(Taps his temple - referring to the tadpole in his brain)*

**Astarion:** You rest. I'll keep watch.

## Alternative: Trusting Astarion

**Astarion:** The pleasure is all mine. Sweet dreams.

---

## Alternative: Not Yet Ready to Rest

**Astarion:** Suit yourself. Sweet dreams.

---

## Alternative: Expressing Distrust

**Astarion:** We'll both stay up. I'm not sleeping helpless in front of a stranger.

**Astarion:** You know, if you want to spend time with me you only have to say so. *(Teeny bit flirty)*

**Astarion:** But suit yourself. I'm sure we'll drift off at some point.
