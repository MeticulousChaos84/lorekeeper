# The Gur Hunter Revelation

**Astarion:** The hunter was a 'Gur'. Does that mean anything to you? Ha! Of course he'd send a Gur to hunt me down. He was a Gur, named Gandrel. A Gur? One of those vagabonds? Why would they - Cazador. Of course he'd send a Gur to hunt me down. Why? What's so special about the Gur people? Why? What's so special about the Gur people? Why? What's so special about the Gur people? It's - nothing. They're not special, they're just easy to buy and morally vacuous. Perfect lackeys. First, they make excellent monster hunters. So 'find a vampire spawn' sounds perfectly reasonable to them. Second, they're the reason I'm like this in the first place. It was a group of Gur that attacked me that night in Baldur's Gate. I would've died had Cazador not appeared and saved me. Saved you by turning you into a vampire slave? Well, he didn't mention the 'slave' clause at the time. And now he sends a Gur monster hunter for me? It's a message. He's reminding me of his power. Even in the middle of nowhere, he can reach me. And he wants me back. You can't hold every Gur responsible for what happened to you. I think you'll find I can. And there's nothing your bleeding heart can do to change my mind. So why send one after you now? To remind you of that night? Perhaps. He probably thought it was funny. But more likely, he's trying to send me a message. He appeared just when you needed him? Sounds convenient. Maybe. Maybe he was just drawn to the smell of blood. The point is I have history with these barbarians. Cazador's sending a message.
