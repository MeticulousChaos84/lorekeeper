## Bite Confrontation

### If Karlach Saw Astarion Bite Someone Else

**Karlach:** Well, well, well. A vampire in our very camp. I had my suspicions. Which you proved all-too-right. So you're a vampire, then. I had my suspicions.

---

### If Karlach Was Bitten

**Karlach:** You *bit* me. No one bites me without my say-so. So you're a vampire, then. I had my suspicions.

### Camp Night Bite - Karlach Was the Victim

**Karlach:** Impressed with myself. I slept like a baby, even after your little display. Sometimes I think I'd sleep through the apocalypse. You're lucky I can handle your bullshit.

**Karlach:** You're welcome.

*or*

**Karlach:** If you're sure about that, then I'm sure about you.

**Gale:** You're being rather philosophical about all this, Karlach. I was expecting a more heated response.

*or*

**Gale:** So long as none of us are on the pointed end of his hunger pangs, I think he deserves a chance.

**Karlach:** New day ahead of us. Let's put this new knowledge to good use in the fight against evil.

### Camp Night Bite - Astarion Was Caught Attempting to Bite Someone

**Karlach:** The vampire wakes. I hope last night's little display was a one-time thing. Lucky for you, I'm very forgiving of mistakes.

**Karlach:** You're welcome.

*or*

**Karlach:** If you're sure about that, then I'm sure about you.

### Act 2 Identity Confrontation

*If Astarion reaches Act 2 without revealing his nature through bite scenes.*

**Karlach:** All right, Astarion. It's time we had the talk. Did you really think you could hide what you are from me forever, vampire?

**Karlach:** What didn't? If I asked a kid to draw a picture of a vampire, they'd come up with *you.*

*or*

**Karlach:** Well yeah. If you were a *proper* vampire, you wouldn't be trudging through the mud with muggins over here.

**Karlach:** Why didn't you tell me sooner?

#### If Astarion Explains He Wanted to Be Sure About Her

**Karlach:** I guess I can't blame you for being cautious. If anything, it proves you're a good ally. We can't help who we are. Or what's been done to us. All we have is what we do now. And from what I can tell, you're sound enough for me.

#### If Astarion Mentions His Old Master (Successful Deception)

**Karlach:** He sounds like a real prick. Well listen, Astarion - they aren't here now. And if they show their ugly face, I'll crack it open. All right?

#### If Persuasion Succeeds

**Karlach:** Fair enough. But I hope you know by now that I'm on your side. Anyone tries to hurt you, and they'll have to answer to the big mad furnace.

**Karlach:** No more secrets, all right? We're in this together-together.

**Karlach:** I can live with that.

*or*

**Karlach:** You're very annoying. But I'm sure you know that.

*or*

**Karlach:** Don't think I won't. *Darling.*

#### If Persuasion Fails

**Karlach:** Sure, in the beginning, but this isn't the beginning anymore, is it? I have to be able to trust you too, you know. No more secrets, all right?

#### If Deception Fails

**Karlach:** You're a bad liar. Strange, for a vamp. Your kind usually sweat charm. I have to be able to trust you too, you know. No more secrets, all right?

## Astarion's Confession

*When Astarion chooses to voluntarily tell Karlach about his vampirism.*

### High Approval - Positive Reception

**Karlach:** There it is. I was hoping you'd tell me yourself. I'm glad - very glad - you trusted me with this. I didn't know for sure, of course. But between the fangs and the red eyes and the timeless wit, I had my inklings.

**Karlach:** We're good, right?

**Karlach:** You bet your arse I am.

*or*

**Karlach:** We're all a little complicated, aren't we? It's a bit of a race to the top of complication mountain, at this point.

*or*

**Karlach:** Don't worry. I'll stomp him. Guaranteed.

*or*

**Karlach:** If he lays a finger on you, I'll break it off. That's a promise.

**Karlach:** Anything else?

---

### Moderate Approval - Acceptance with Edge

**Karlach:** I'm glad you told me. Thought maybe you were going to keep it a secret forever. I didn't know for sure, of course. But between the fangs and the red eyes and the timeless wit, I had my inklings. Luckily I'm not the type to hold someone's past against them. As long as I can trust you, I don't care what you are.

**Karlach:** We're good, right?

**Karlach:** 'Happy' might be pushing it. But we make a formidable group. No sense breaking it up yet.

*or*

**Karlach:** Let's cross that bridge when we get to it. Only got room for so much drama at a time.

*or*

**Karlach:** Don't worry. I'll stomp him. Guaranteed.

**Karlach:** Anything else?

### Low Approval - Reluctant Acceptance

**Karlach:** Knew there was something off about you. That you might be a vamp entered my mind, for sure. Luckily I'm not the type to hold someone's past against them. As long as I can trust you, I don't care what you are.

*or*

**Karlach:** I had my suspicions. Would've helped if you'd told me sooner. But it is what it is. Luckily I'm not the type to hold someone's past against them. As long as I can trust you, I don't care what you are.

---

### Neutral Approval - Direct Telling

**Karlach:** The truth. *Finally.* I didn't know for sure, of course. But between the fangs and the red eyes and the timeless wit, I had my inklings.
