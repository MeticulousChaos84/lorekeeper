**Astarion:** You never asked me to take my shirt off. I always thought they were a sign of my humiliation. I never realised there might be more to them. But Raphael told us he can make the impossible come true. I have to try my luck.

### Alternative: If you express concern about trusting Raphael

**Astarion:** I don't trust him. He doesn't trust me. We are using one another for our mutual benefit. You should try it some time.

### Alternative: If you offer support

**Astarion:** Thank you. Honestly, though, I was just trying not to think about them, but there's a lead now.

### Alternative: If you express anger at Cazador

**Astarion:** I used to just be sickened, thinking it was his sadistic pleasure. But there's more. There was method to it. The depravity of the act was a distraction. I have to get to the truth of it.

### Alternative: If you demand he not keep secrets

**Astarion:** Well - if you must know... I'm actually a princess of House Nightstar. And I'm married to a tarrasque named Johnathan. Anything else you'd like to know?
