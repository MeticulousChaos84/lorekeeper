# Discussing Raphael's Deal

**Astarion:** Are you really going to trust that devil to keep his word if we kill this orthon? I'd trust a devil over a vampire any day. I think he likes us. I like him, too. But I'd never say it to his smarmy face. Perhaps if we kill this orthon extra bloody, he'll invite us for tea and brandy back in his House. Just stay on your guard. Am I not the very definition of 'careful'? Devils will take everything they can get. And more besides. Fret not, my soul is quite safe. I am not about to swap one master for another. Even though he's using me, I'm using him, too. And what do I care about this orthon's life? It's your only lead, I suppose. This is the first chance I've had to decipher my scars. Be a dear, don't get in my way. The orthon is dead. Aren't you pleased? So, there's a monster hunter after you? Not anymore. Which is all that matters, really. Not anymore. Which is all that matters, really. That monster hunter we met in the swamp - he's looking for you, isn't he? So it would seem. Hopefully he bumps into some gnolls while stumbling around at night and that's the last we hear from him.
