# General Camp Greeting

**Astarion:** Well, hello. What can I do for you? Need something? Yes? Tell me about yourself. Oh, what's to tell? I'm a magistrate back in the city - it's all rather tedious. What's to tell? I was sired by a vampire named Cazador. Everything before that is so long ago it's ancient history. And everything that came after - well, I'd rather not reflect on it. You must remember your life before that? I was a magistrate, working to keep the peace in Baldur's Gate. Imprisoning trouble makers, that kind of thing. I can't remember much, truth be told. Centuries of torment will do that to you. How were you turned? I was attacked. A gang of vagrants, a tribe of wandering 'Gur', took issue with a ruling I'd made. They beat me to death's door when Cazador appeared. He chased them off and offered to save me. To give me eternal life. Given that my choices were 'eternal life' or 'bleed to death on the street', I took him up on the offer. It was only afterwards I realised just how long 'eternity' could be.
