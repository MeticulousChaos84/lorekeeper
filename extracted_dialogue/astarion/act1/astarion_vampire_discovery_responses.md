## When Party Witnesses Him Bite Someone

**Astarion:** Technically, I'm a vampire spawn. But don't worry, I'll stick to biting those who're trying to kill us. Mostly.

## After the Camp Night Bite Incident

### Response 1: Apologetic

**Astarion:** A vampire spawn, technically, but - listen, last night was a mistake. It won't happen again, I swear.

### Response 2: Dismissive

**Astarion:** A vampire spawn, technically, but - look, it was a mistake. It won't happen again.

### Response 3: Vulnerable

**Astarion:** A vampire spawn, technically, but - well, I hope this doesn't change things between us.

### Response 4: Reassuring

**Astarion:** A vampire spawn, so - look, I made a mistake. But you can trust me, I swear.

## Key Themes

- **Vampire Spawn vs Vampire:** Astarion consistently corrects the assumption he's a full vampire, specifying he's a vampire spawn
- **"Mostly":** His qualification about only biting enemies reveals his uncertainty about control
- **Mistake Framing:** When caught feeding on companions, he frames it as an error in judgment, not predatory intent
- **Relationship Concern:** Aware that his nature could damage trust with the party
