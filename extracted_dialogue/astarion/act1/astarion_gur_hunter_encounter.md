---

## Initial Meeting

**Gandrel:** Ah, stranger. Forgive the aroma.

**Narrator:** *You catch a waft of something foul - metallic and sickly-sweet.*

**Gandrel:** Powdered iron-vine. An old hunter's trick - most monsters will think twice before making a meal of me.

**Astarion:** You're a monster hunter? I'm surprised - I thought all Gur were vagrant cut-throats.

### Player Response Options

**[Say nothing]**

**Gandrel:** And more! We steal chickens, curse your crops, seduce your daughters - the list goes on. I wish I had half the power settled folk think my people possess. Alas, I am a simple wanderer. A simple wanderer and monster hunter. But I'm no witchdoctor or cut-throat.

---

**[Ask about the Gur]**

**Gandrel:** A mystical and dangerous people, we travel the land, never settling in one place. We steal your chickens, curse your crops, seduce your daughters - your friend here has heard it all, I'm sure. I wish I had half the power settled folk think my people possess. Alas, I am a simple wanderer. A simple wanderer and monster hunter. But I'm no witchdoctor or cut-throat.

---

**[Call out Astarion's racism]**

**Gandrel:** Your friend has just heard the rumours of my people. That we steal chickens, curse your crops, seduce your daughters... I wish I had half the power settled folk think my people possess. Alas, I am a simple wanderer. A simple wanderer and monster hunter. But I'm no witchdoctor or cut-throat.

---

**[Ignore the elf]**

**Gandrel:** You should listen to your companion. Next he'll warn you that my people can curse your cow to give only sour milk and will seduce your daughter to a life of roaming. I wish I had half the power settled folk think my people possess. Alas, I am a simple wanderer. A simple wanderer and monster hunter. But I'm no witchdoctor or cut-throat.

## Learning About His Prey

**[If player knows about the hag]**

**Astarion:** Or to make a deal with her. Probably think you can outfox the old dear.

**Gandrel:** Right, but very wrong. My prey is a vampire spawn - much less impressive than the beast that lives here. I fear he's gone to ground. I hope the hag of these lands can help me flush him out, if I can afford her blood price.

---

**[If hag is dead]**

**Gandrel:** Right, but very wrong. My prey is a vampire spawn - much less impressive than the beast that lives here. I fear he's gone to ground. I hoped the hag of these lands could help me flush him out, but it seems she is no more.

---

**[Alternate path: Ask what he's hunting]**

**Astarion:** Something terrifying, no doubt. Dragon? Cyclops? Kobold?

**Gandrel:** Nothing so dramatic. I'm hunting for a vampire spawn.

*(Same continuation as above)*

---

**[Alternate path: Accuse him of being a cut-throat]**

**Gandrel:** True. And I have no proof to offer but my word. If you wish it, our paths need not cross again. I'm hunting a vampire spawn, and it is a little too bright for you to be my prey.

*(Same continuation as above)*

---

## The Mission Details

**Astarion:** A vampire spawn? Why?

**Gandrel:** It is a sacred mission from the head of my tribe. She sent me here to capture the beast and return it to her.

**Astarion:** Capture? And bring it where?

**Gandrel:** Baldur's Gate. My people wait for me there.

---

**[If player passes Insight check]**

**Narrator:** *Under all the smiles, you can feel Astarion's tension. He's coiled like a spring, hand inching towards his weapon.*

---

### Continuation Options

#### Path 1: Warning Astarion

**[Cough and give Astarion a warning look]**

**Gandrel:** Is your friend ill? I have some tea that might help...

**Astarion:** No. No, I'm quite well.

**Astarion:** We should go, but you have fun tracking your monster.

---

#### Path 2: Asking Questions

**[Ask how to capture a vampire]**

**Gandrel:** At night, of course! Beyond that, I will say no more. There are some trade secrets we cannot share.

**Astarion:** How sensible. We should go, but you have fun tracking your monster.

---

#### Path 3: Confronting Astarion's Behavior

**[To Astarion: You're asking a lot of questions]**

**Astarion:** There's a lot to know. I've crossed paths with your people before, you know. It wasn't a good experience.

*[Astarion kills Gandrel]*

---

**[Say nothing after noticing tension]**

**Astarion:** I've crossed paths with your people before, you know. It wasn't a good experience.

*[Astarion kills Gandrel]*

## After Astarion Kills the Hunter

### Player Reactions

**[Express anger: What the hells? He could have helped us!]**

**Astarion:** The Gur help themselves, no one else. Whatever his price, it would've been too much. Trust me, I did us a favour.

**[Don't trust him after that]**

**Astarion:** It's a figure of speech, darling. I'd be disappointed if you trusted me at all. Now, if we're done, we have more important business to get on with.

---

**[Ask for a good reason]**

**Astarion:** He was spinning a tale, and you were falling for it. Vampires? Sacred missions? Honestly. He would've followed us to camp and slit our throats in the night. Trust me, I did us a favour.

*(Same continuation as above)*

---

**[That bad, huh?]**

**Astarion:** That bad. Let's go, we've wasted enough time talking.

---

**[What favour, exactly? He didn't need to die.]**

**Astarion:** I had my reasons, you can be sure of that. Now, if we're done, we have more important business to get on with.

---

**[Warn me next time before you murder someone]**

**Astarion:** I absolutely, definitely will think about it. Now, if we're done, we have more important business to get on with.

---

## Alternate Ending: Peaceful Departure

**[If player wants to leave peacefully]**

**Astarion:** We should go, but you have fun tracking your monster.

**Gandrel:** The elf is right. I have my own road to walk.

**[If hag is dead]**

**Gandrel:** A more difficult road, now that the hag is gone, but perhaps a better one. But I wish you well. Be safe.

---

**[If hag is alive]**

**Gandrel:** A road that leads me straight to a hag's den, alas. But I wish you well. Be safe.

---

## Optional Expanded Conversation

**[Only if player asked about vampire spawn strength]**

**Astarion:** I don't know. I'm sure a vampire spawn could still rip your throat out if he felt like it.

**Gandrel:** He is right, unfortunately. They are only weak when compared to their masters. During the day, we have the advantage. But at night, when they hunt? You will not find a more deadly quarry.

**Astarion:** We've all survived so far. Let's focus on that.

**Gandrel:** It would still be wise to post guards at night. The threat is real.

**Astarion:** Indeed it is. We should do something about this threat.

---

### If Player Walks Away After This

**Astarion:** Wait - that's it? We're just walking away? Don't you think we should do something about the... vampire issue?

**[I said we'll be careful. Now let's go.]**

**Astarion:** Fine. But if this comes back to bite us, it's on your head.

**Gandrel:** Go in peace, my friends. I pray our paths cross again.

**Astarion:** They'd better bloody not.

---

## Alternative: If Gandrel Names Astarion

*(In some dialogue paths, Gandrel knows Astarion's name)*

**Gandrel:** His name is Astarion, but I fear he's gone to ground. I hope the hag of these lands can help me flush him out, if I can afford her blood price.

**[Ask if he'll kill Astarion]**

**Gandrel:** Not this time. My orders are to capture him.

**Astarion:** Oh? And bring him where, exactly?

**Gandrel:** Baldur's Gate. My people wait for me there.

---

**[Ask what Astarion thinks - revealing his identity]**

**Gandrel:** *That's* Astarion? No. Impossible.

**Astarion:** These days, I'm making the impossible look easy. May I?

**[Nod - allow Astarion to kill him]**

**Astarion:** Excellent.

**Gandrel:** The vampire? It can't be.

*[Combat begins]*
