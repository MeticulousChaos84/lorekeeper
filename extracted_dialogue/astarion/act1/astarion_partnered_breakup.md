## Initiating the Breakup

**Astarion:** Oh shit. I - did I do something wrong? Why? What's changed?

## Path: Partial Ceremorphosis

**Context:** Avatar has accepted partial transformation into a mind flayer and tries to end things to protect Astarion.

**Tags:** `PARTIAL_CEREMORPH`

**Astarion:** Oh, come off. You're wonderful. I don't care what you look like. What you cannot do is make my decisions for me. I've had more than enough of that in my life. I bet I still get more stares walking down a street than you.

**Astarion:** I am. And beautiful - not enough people mention that. I'm not going *anywhere*.

## Path: Generic Breakup

**Astarion:** If that's what you want... then that's where we'll leave it. Well... Goodbye, then. I suppose. You brought my dead heart back to life. It will keep beating.

## Early Relationship Breakup

**Alternative:** If breaking up earlier in the relationship, before full commitment:

**Astarion:** I - I can hardly blame you. I don't exactly have much to offer right now, beyond new burdens to carry.

### If told he's not ready for a partner:

**Astarion:** Would I were. It's true, you don't deserve this facade any longer. From the start, I was rather counting the hours until it was going to end. Midnight chimes, eh?

### If told this isn't what was wanted:

**Astarion:** I was beginning to believe someone truly wanted me. But I shouldn't have deluded myself. From the start, I was rather counting the hours until it was going to end. Midnight chimes, eh?

### If told you don't want his trauma:

**Astarion:** You gave me precious, impossible moments of comfort. I only really wanted a few more. From the start, I was rather counting the hours until it was going to end. Midnight chimes, eh?
