# Astarion and the Necromancy Tome

*After giving Astarion the Tome of Thayan Necromancy, he begins to study it at camp to learn its secrets. He's frustrated by the voices of the spirits contained within the book, which are stopping him from accessing the secrets he's sure it contains. If he pushes the spirits too far, they'll respond with force - tearing at him with spectral hands. His tone is on edge - nearly obsessive about discovering what's in the book. He won't part with it, even if he can't read it right now.*

## The Book Fights Back

**Astarion:** Come on, come on. What are you hiding? *(Looking through the book, talking to self/book)*

**Astarion:** Can you summon the dead? Bring them back? Can you - ugh, can you shut up and let me read? *('ugh, can you shut up and let me read?' is said to the book. There are spirits that only Astarion can hear, trying to tempt him.)*

**Astarion:** What? No - not you. *or* What? No. I - I'm fine. *(Realizes the player is nearby and talking to him. A little rattled, having been talking to a haunted book.)*

**Astarion:** I was just perusing this little find and - WILL YOU SHUT UP?! *(Starts speaking to the player, but then shouts at the book. Astarion slams the open book shut.)*

**Astarion:** Forgive me. This book reads you more than you read it. *(Tired.)*

**Astarion:** I mean it plays with your mind. There are secrets here, but the book has spirits. They fight you every step of the way. *or* No, there's something in here. But the voices - the spirits in the book won't let me see it. *or* I can't. I feel a connection with it, but the spirits within fight me at every step.

### How Far He's Read

**Astarion:** I almost reached the end before they drove me out. And drove me all but mad. Now every time I open it, the voices surge back into my mind. I can't reason with them - they exist to protect that book.

*or*

**Astarion:** I got deep into the pages of this book before they drove me out. And almost drove me mad. Now every time I open it, the voices surge back into my mind. I can't reason with them - they exist to protect that book.

*or*

**Astarion:** I only read one page before their maddening whispers drove me away. Now every time I open it, the voices surge back into my mind. I can't reason with them - they exist to protect that book.

*or*

**Astarion:** I barely opened it when they started whispering from the shadows. Now every time I open it, the voices surge back into my mind. I can't reason with them - they exist to protect that book.

## What He Hopes to Find

**Astarion:** I don't know. That's the point - they're *secret*. *(the player asked a stupid question: "what secrets?")*

**Astarion:** Maybe. Maybe not. It's hard to know what's lurking in here.

**Astarion:** Someone went through a lot of trouble to protect this tome. It has to be something more than a book of cantrips. *(Cantrips = very minor magical spells.)*

**Astarion:** It's a book of necromancy, full of secrets about controlling the dead, returning the dead to life, and who knows what else.

**Astarion:** Whatever's in here, it might give me an edge over Cazador. Or free me from him entirely. *or* Whatever's in here, it might give me an edge over my old master Cazador. Or free me from him entirely. *(if Cazador hasn't been mentioned yet)*

**Astarion:** Although I can't make any progress as long as those spirits remember their mission. It seems to be all they know.

**Astarion:** Still. If nothing else, maybe I can beat Cazador to death with it.

## Putting the Book Aside (For Now)

**Astarion:** Still, I doubt this will help us with our parasites. Maybe it's better to put it aside for now. *(Astarion puts the book away.)*

**Player:** Yes, best to focus on what's urgent.

**Astarion:** Indeed. As long as the spirits remember their mission, the book is a lost cause.

**Astarion:** And I should rest. This has all been a lot. *(Weary after mentally battling the spirits in the book.)*

*or*

**Player:** Keep at it. Maybe you'll figure out a way.

**Astarion:** As long as those spirits remember their mission, I doubt it. Keeping the book safe is all they know.

**Astarion:** But still, we live in hope. Figuratively speaking.

*or*

**Player:** I could hold on to it if you like?

**Astarion:** Trust me, the spirits won't be any kinder to you. As long as they remember their duty to protect this book, no one's getting in.

**Astarion:** Anyway, I'd rather keep it where I can see it. Its time will come, I'm sure.

## Alternative: Staying Silent (The Spirit Attack)

*If the player stays silent when Astarion is struggling with the book, the spirits begin to attack him more aggressively:*

**Astarion:** No, I won't kill them! Well, maybe Gale... *or* Well, maybe Wyll... *or* Well, maybe Shadowheart... *or* Well, maybe the gith... *or* Well, maybe the tiefling... *(The book's telling him to kill companions. An emphatic no, then considering)* *or* No - stop it - I won't kill them! *(To book. 'stop it' = 'stop saying that')*

**Astarion:** I can't. I won't. Now - stop! *(Astarion struggles against invisible spectral hands. These hands are invisible to the player, but Astarion can see them.)*

**Astarion:** Let. Me. Go! Ah... Hello. *(Astarion strains against the hands and snaps the book shut, at which point the invisible hands vanish and he's free. He notices the player looking at him.)*

**Player:** Good book? *or* What in the hells was that? *or* You're not killing anyone in this party.

**Astarion:** A unique read, certainly. A tome of necromancy, guarded by spirits. *or* I'm not sure. A dance with death, maybe. This is a powerful book of necromancy, but it's guarded by spirits. *or* Of course I'm not. It's just - it gets to you. *(referring to the book he's holding, and the voices he hears)* This is a powerful book of necromancy, but it's guarded by spirits.

*[This path then continues with the same conversation about how far he's read and what to do with the book]*

## If the Player Simply Leaves

*If the player chooses to leave without engaging:*

**Astarion:** Just tell me what I need to know. Tell me your secrets. *(To book)*
