# Regret and Forgiveness

**Astarion:** I can't forgive myself for what happened between us. I can't forgive you, either. Just... don't make me think about it. Let's talk about something else. Anything else. So, about you biting me... So, about you trying to bite me... I met a monster hunter in the swamp. He's not after you, is he? Excuse me? Not every monster hunter we stumble across is trying to kill me. Then again, we're not exactly keeping a low profile out here. Fine, I'll bite. What did he look like? Human, dark hair, lithe build. A Gur by the name of Gandrel. He was a hulking dragonborn. Red scales, fire breath - very impressive. He was one of my people. Red-scaled and larger than I - an impressive warrior. That's interesting, but not the kind of person I'd expect to be hunting me. Still, it's wise to keep our eyes open. I'm hardly the only monster around here. I can't remember. I wasn't taking notes. Well, this has been very useful, thank you. Is there anything else? Any new and interesting ways you can waste my time? You can feed on me tonight, if you'd like. My sweet, there is nothing I'd like more. I'll come to you tonight, when you're snugly wrapped in your bedroll and we can have a little privacy. And this time I'll make sure I'm quiet - we don't want to disturb your rest. But I will taste you - savour you. Just enough to give me strength, and just enough to leave you wanting more.
