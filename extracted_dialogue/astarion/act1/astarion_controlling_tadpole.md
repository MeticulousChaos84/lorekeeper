# Astarion - Controlling the Tadpole

**Astarion:** You know, I feel a connection between us. Like we're two souls walking the same path. You might be a little naive in the ways of the world, but I see promise in you. Ambition.

Just that you... have a big heart. You like doing what's right. So I was thinking, what would be the right thing to do when we get to Moonrise Towers? When we come face-to-face with whoever is controlling the parasites in our heads.

Gods... No, try to think outside the box. Just a little. Consider the parasites in our skulls and think - how many others have the mind flayers infected? Hundreds? Thousands? And they're not just goblin trash - there are powerful people in the worms' thrall. Whoever's waiting for us at Moonrise Towers controls it all. But if we can take that control from them, imagine the power we'd wield.

## If Asked How

**Astarion:** I mean - I assume there's some device controlling these things, so we find *that*, murder some people, and... Look, I'm not a 'details' person, all right? But turning up and causing chaos has worked for us so far.

## Addressing Concerns About Transformation

**Astarion:** That's just the thing - if we control the parasites, then we can order them not to change us. All the power with none of the tentacles.

---

## The Pitch

**Astarion:** I'm just saying there's an opportunity before us. If we can control the tadpoles, we can keep ourselves safe and enjoy a little world domination on the side. You can't tell me that doesn't sound fun.

## If Agreeing

**Astarion:** Isn't it? Imagine, the entire cult under our thumb. I knew I was right about you. It's so good to find a kindred spirit. Of course, this all assumes we live long enough to find this 'Moonrise'. But I'm feeling optimistic.

---

## If Considering

**Astarion:** Do. It's not often the universe hands you something like this - we'd be fools to squander it. Of course, this all assumes we live long enough to find this 'Moonrise'. But I'm feeling optimistic.

---

## If Declining

**Astarion:** A pity, I thought you had more ambition than that. Still, we're not there yet. Maybe you'll see the light yet.

---

## Alternative Opening (If Player Expresses Distrust)

**Astarion:** Such a strong word. We have our differences, but we don't *have* to, do we? I just worry that we're not considering all our options when it comes to our uninvited guests.

---

## Alternative Framing (For Reluctant Players)

**Astarion:** I'm just saying there's an opportunity here. If we can control the tadpoles, we can keep ourselves safe and liberate the world from this evil.

---

## If Player Calls Power Evil

**Astarion:** Power is just a tool, it's people that are good or evil. And even they can be a little bit...
