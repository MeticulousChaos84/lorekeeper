**Astarion:** You know, I feel a connection between us. Like we're two souls walking the same path.

**Astarion:** You might be a little naive in the ways of the world, but I see promise in you. Ambition.

**Astarion:** Just that you... have a big heart. You like doing what's right.

**Astarion:** So I was thinking, what would be the right thing to do when we get to Moonrise Towers? When we come face-to-face with whoever is controlling the parasites in our heads.

**Astarion:** Gods... No, try to think outside the box. Just a little. *(With a sigh, maybe pinching the bridge of his nose because the player is so fucking dense. But Astarion is trying to get the player on board with stealing a whole lot of power, so he has to lead them down the path and can't just call them an idiot.)*

**Astarion:** Consider the parasites in our skulls and think - how many others have the mind flayers infected? Hundreds? Thousands?

**Astarion:** And they're not just goblin trash - there are powerful people in the worms' thrall. *(if visited goblin camp)*

**Astarion:** Whoever's waiting for us at Moonrise Towers controls it all. But if we can take that control from them, imagine the power we'd wield.

## Alternative: Player Open to the Idea

**Astarion:** Isn't it? Imagine, the entire cult under our thumb.

**Astarion:** I'm just saying there's an opportunity before us. If we can control the tadpoles, we can keep ourselves safe and enjoy a little world domination on the side.

**Astarion:** You can't tell me that doesn't sound fun.

**Astarion:** I knew I was right about you. It's so good to find a kindred spirit.

**Astarion:** Of course, this all assumes we live long enough to find this 'Moonrise'. But I'm feeling optimistic.

or

**Astarion:** Do. It's not often the universe hands you something like this - we'd be fools to squander it.

**Astarion:** Of course, this all assumes we live long enough to find this 'Moonrise'. But I'm feeling optimistic.

## Alternative: Player Questions the Plan

**Astarion:** I mean - I assume there's some device controlling these things, so we find *that*, murder some people, and... *(Trying to sound like he knows what he's talking about, though he doesn't actually have a plan beyond "stealing power good".)*

**Astarion:** Look, I'm not a 'details' person, all right? But turning up and causing chaos has worked for us so far. *(Giving up trying to sound authoritative.)*

**Astarion:** I'm just saying there's an opportunity before us. If we can control the tadpoles, we can keep ourselves safe and enjoy a little world domination on the side.

**Astarion:** You can't tell me that doesn't sound fun.

## Alternative: Player Worried About Transformation

**Astarion:** That's just the thing - if we control the parasites, then we can order them not to change us. All the power with none of the tentacles.

**Astarion:** I'm just saying there's an opportunity before us. If we can control the tadpoles, we can keep ourselves safe and enjoy a little world domination on the side.

**Astarion:** You can't tell me that doesn't sound fun.

## Alternative: Player Wants to Remove the Tadpole

**Astarion:** A pity, I thought you had more ambition than that.

**Astarion:** Still, we're not there yet. Maybe you'll see the light yet.

**Astarion:** Of course, this all assumes we live long enough to find this 'Moonrise'. But I'm feeling optimistic.

## Alternative: Morally Framed Pitch (For Good-Aligned Players)

**Astarion:** I just worry that we're not considering all our options when it comes to our uninvited guests.

**Astarion:** How many people are infected with them, do you think? Hundreds? Thousands?

**Astarion:** And they're not just goblin trash - there are powerful people in the worms' thrall. *(if visited goblin camp)*

**Astarion:** Whoever's waiting for us at Moonrise Towers controls it all. But if we can take that control from them, imagine the power we'd wield.

**Astarion:** Yes, exactly! *(Surprised and hyped that the player got it in one. He didn't think you'd be on board with the idea.)*

**Astarion:** Just think, how many people have the mind flayers infected? Hundreds? Thousands?

## Alternative: Player Concerned About Evil Power

**Astarion:** Power is just a tool, it's people that are good or evil.

**Astarion:** And even they can be a little bit... *(Can't quite find the words to convey "even evil people can be a little bit good" so just mimes weighing scales with his hands.)*

**Astarion:** I'm just saying there's an opportunity here. If we can control the tadpoles, we can keep ourselves safe and liberate the world from this evil. *(Pause before 'liberate' as he considers what would sound good to a goody-two-shoes player. Astarion was thinking less liberate, more dominate.)*

**Astarion:** So much for thinking you had ambition.

**Astarion:** Still, we're not there yet. Maybe you'll see the light yet.

**Astarion:** Of course, this all assumes we live long enough to find this 'Moonrise'. But I'm feeling optimistic.

or

## Alternative: Player Previously Hostile to Astarion

**Astarion:** You know, I feel a connection between us. Like we're two souls walking the same path.

**Astarion:** Well, no, I was being generous. But you're not beyond hope.

**Astarion:** I just worry that we're not considering all our options when it comes to our uninvited guests.

**Astarion:** How many people are infected with them, do you think? Hundreds? Thousands?

or

**Astarion:** Such a strong word. We have our differences, but we don't *have* to, do we?
