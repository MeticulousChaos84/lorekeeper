**Astarion:** Darling, I was just thinking about you.

**Astarion:** Remembering our time together, the things we've shared - and I don't just mean that lovely neck of yours.

**Astarion:** I'm growing to like the whole package, honestly. And you clearly like me too, so...

**Astarion:** I could feel it as I was getting lost in your neck. Your little shakes of excitement.

**Astarion:** You enjoyed it, didn't you?

## Response Path: Playing Coy

**Astarion:** You don't have to say a thing - I already know how you feel. Because I feel it too.

**Astarion:** We could take an evening to ourselves. Get away from camp - get some privacy.

**Astarion:** I know somewhere quiet. Somewhere intimate. Somewhere we can... indulge in each other.

**Astarion:** Wonderful. I just hope we don't have to wait too long before we can steal away. *(said with a huge smile)*

**Astarion:** But once we can, I promise you a night you'll never forget.

**Astarion:** See you there, lover.

## Response Path: Suspicious of Intent

**Astarion:** We could take an evening to ourselves. Get away from camp - get some privacy.

**Astarion:** I know somewhere quiet. Somewhere intimate. Somewhere we can... indulge in each other.

**Astarion:** Thank goodness we're all such good, trusting friends, then.

**Astarion:** On my honour, the only thing on my mind is depraved, carnal lust.

## Response Path: Concerns About Obligation

*(This option only appears if Astarion previously mentioned sex as a reward for letting him bite you)*

**Astarion:** Oh, that's hardly the only reason. It's more of an excuse if anything.

**Astarion:** Assuming you want this too, of course. But we both know you do.

## Alternative: Downplaying Enjoyment of the Bite

**Astarion:** Come now, don't be coy. Your body's already given you away.

**Astarion:** I could feel it as I was getting lost in your neck. Your little shakes of excitement.

**Astarion:** You enjoyed it, didn't you?
