## The Invitation

**Astarion:** Darling, I was just thinking about you. Remembering our time together, the things we've shared - and I don't just mean that lovely neck of yours. I'm growing to like the whole package, honestly. And you clearly like me too, so...

**Astarion:** What gave it away? I could feel it as I was getting lost in your neck. Your little shakes of excitement. You enjoyed it, didn't you?

**Astarion:** A gentleman/lady never tells. or You'll never get me to admit it. You don't have to say a thing - I already know how you feel. Because I feel it too.

*Alternative:*

**Astarion:** Yes, I did. So did I. More than words can say.

**Astarion:** You deserve a reward. I am so very pleased with what you gave me. We could take an evening to ourselves. Get away from camp - get some privacy. I know somewhere quiet. Somewhere intimate. Somewhere we can... indulge in each other.

**Astarion:** That sounds pretty good to me. Wonderful. I just hope we don't have to wait too long before we can steal away. But once we can, I promise you a night you'll never forget. See you there, lover.

## Alternative Responses

*If you're suspicious:*

**Astarion:** A less trusting person might think this all sounds very suspicious. Thank goodness we're all such good, trusting friends, then. On my honour, the only thing on my mind is depraved, carnal lust.

*If you mentioned him treating it as payment for the bite:*

**Astarion:** You shouldn't do this just because you feel like you owe me something... Oh, that's hardly the only reason. It's more of an excuse if anything. Assuming you want this too, of course. But we both know you do.

*If you only let him bite to make him stronger:*

**Astarion:** I only did it to help you get stronger. And look how well it worked! I've never felt better, all thanks to you. So let me repay you for your noble sacrifice.

*If the bite hurt:*

**Astarion:** No! It hurt like the hells. Then let me make it up to you. You gave me a wonderful gift - it's only fair I return the favour.

## Being Coy

*If you're noncommittal:*

**Astarion:** ...So? Come now, don't be coy. Your body's already given you away.

## Rejection

*If you reject him:*

**Astarion:** Absolutely not. Oh you are no fun at all.

*If you insult him:*

**Astarion:** I'd rather kiss a leech - they're just as attractive, but take less blood. Ha! Maybe there's more to you than I thought. Deny your feelings all you like, it doesn't matter to me. I've already tasted you, and that's all the carnal delight I need.

*If you simply leave:*

**Astarion:** What? Was it something I said?
