# After the Bite Attempt
**Location:** Camp (morning after)
**Act:** 1
**Participants:** Astarion, Player
**Triggers:** The morning after Astarion attempts to bite the player

---

**Astarion:** I already apologised. What more do you want?

**Astarion:** Unless you're looking for another nibble...

**Astarion:** Fine, as long as I don't have to go back to animal blood. It's muck. But now that you know what I am, I can fight with all my weapons, teeth included. And if I happen to drain the occasional bandit, what's the harm?

**Astarion:** Excellent! Now, shall we go? I already feel a little peckish.

or

**Astarion:** As am I. I'm starting to feel a little peckish already.

## Alternative: Open to Future Feeding (With Consent)

**Astarion:** Maybe. But there won't be any more midnight surprises, I can promise you that.

## Alternative: Establishing Feeding Rules

**Astarion:** No innocents, you have my word. Only villains that we need to kill anyway. After all, you know what I am now. I can fight with all my weapons - teeth included. And if I happen to drain the occasional bandit during a fight, what's the harm? They're just as dead.

**Astarion:** Excellent! Now, shall we go? I already feel a little peckish.

or

**Astarion:** As am I. I'm starting to feel a little peckish already.

or

**Astarion:** Of course! That sounds eminently reasonable. I shall wait patiently until you suggest we... dine together. But until then: no more late-night surprises, you have my word on that.

## Alternative: Animals Only

**Astarion:** What? Look, I swear I won't come after yours, but anyone's? You know what I am now. I can fight with all my weapons - teeth included. And if I happen to drain the occasional bandit during a fight, what's the harm? They're just as dead.

**Astarion:** What? You're joking?

**Astarion:** Although... what do you consider an animal? I mean, elves and humans are obviously out, but goblins? Kobolds? Gnomes? *(if player is a gnome)* / Halflings? *(if player is not a gnome)*

**Astarion:** You can literally talk to animals. What does that leave me - rocks and trees? *(if player has Speak with Animals)*

**Astarion:** Not that I'd be surprised to see a druid talking to a tree... *(if player is a druid)*

**Astarion:** But fine. I'll do my best to feed on only the dumbest animals.

or

**Astarion:** In that case, I'll restrict myself to animals and only the dullest goblins. *(if player doesn't have Speak with Animals)*

or

**Astarion:** You're overestimating how capable goblins are of thought, but fine. We'll do it your way.

## Alternative: Firm Warning

**Astarion:** You have my word. From here on out, I'll only feed on villains and vagabonds. After all, you know what I am now. I can fight with all my weapons - teeth included. And if I happen to drain the occasional bandit during a fight, what's the harm? They're just as dead.
