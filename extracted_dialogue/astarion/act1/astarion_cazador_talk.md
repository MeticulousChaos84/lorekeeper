## If Raphael Revealed the Ritual

**Astarion:** Baldur's Gate is right over the hills. And so is Cazador...

**Astarion:** Cazador and his Rite of Profane Ascension. An imperious soiree, attended by devils and spawn alike...

**Astarion:** A grand ceremony to honour one exalted vampiric master, and elevate him to an unfathomable station.

**Astarion:** To place him in a position of such esteem the world will yearn to kneel and offer their necks.

**Astarion:** Of course I envy him. Why wouldn't I? The problem with what Cazador has done is that he did it to *me*.

or

**Astarion:** Then you've been thinking the same thing.

or

**Astarion:** We will kill him, but there's more to it. Think about it. It sounds like Cazador, for all his evils, has gotten further than any of my kind ever have. He's on the verge of a miracle.

or

**Astarion:** We will kill him, but there's more to it. Think about it. It sounds like Cazador, for all his evils, has gotten further than any of my kind ever have. He's on the verge of a miracle. This may be a beginning, not an end. I can see myself now. Lord, King, *Master*.

**Astarion:** If the time comes, and I can stay one move ahead of him, I'll take his place before his blood can hit the floor.

**Astarion:** What's a handful of the wretch's servants? If they're anything like me when I was enslaved, they're all but begging for death anyway.

or

**Astarion:** Doesn't it sound delightful? For the lucky little vampire on the winning side?

**Astarion:** After two hundred years of shit, *pure shit*, I think I deserve something better.

**Astarion:** I know you do. It matters to me, as well. I want to be able to protect you, too. *(if partnered)*

or

**Astarion:** Look, I appreciate that. Very grateful, *of course*. *(if not partnered)*

**Astarion:** All I'm saying is: let's be clever about it. If an opportunity arises for me to become a more magnificent bastard than I already am, why turn it down?

or

**Astarion:** We'll be glorious both, you and I. You'll have your day, too.

**Astarion:** Let's find out more about the ritual before we waltz into Cazador's front door.

**Astarion:** If we track down my old comrades - the other spawn - we may discover more... and be finely positioned for yours truly to *ascend*.

**Astarion:** You're too adorable. I'll be fine. I'm sure they'll bring back memories of so many pathetic years, but I'm much stronger now. *(if partnered and player expresses concern)*

or

**Astarion:** My, my. You sweetheart. Then there isn't a moment to waste.

or

**Astarion:** We're going to *Baldur's Gate*. The city of one-in-a-million chances, splendour and squalor. Anything could happen.

**Astarion:** If we don't find my brethren, they will find us. Likely with bared fangs.

**Astarion:** We should get to them first, then we can make their pretty tongues talk.

**Astarion:** Unless Cazador has changed their orders, they'll be in the dens of this town, seeking prey.

## If Raphael Has Not Revealed the Ritual

**Astarion:** The Gate is close... as is Cazador.

**Astarion:** And we are no closer to knowing why that bastard is so obsessed with getting me back.

**Astarion:** I think we should track down my fellow spawn. I'm not exactly looking forward to a reunion, but perhaps they'll know something.

**Astarion:** If we find them, we can force them to tell us what he's been doing since I was gone.

**Astarion:** And, honestly, I imagine they'll be coming for me in the night if I don't.

**Astarion:** Unless Cazador has changed their orders, they'll be in the dens of this town, seeking prey.

**Astarion:** We should get to them first, then we can make their pretty tongues talk.

or

**Astarion:** Oh, they'll be here for you, too. Unless Cazador has changed their orders, they'll be in the dens of this town, seeking prey.

or

**Astarion:** I know, I'm a real delight. But we're in danger, and we will have to face the other spawn at some point. We should get to them first, then we can make their pretty tongues talk. Unless Cazador has changed their orders, they'll be in the dens of this town, seeking prey.

### Alternative: Player Shows Remorse About Blocking Information

**Astarion:** Who was the one who thwarted the deal with Raphael, hmm? *(If player blocked the Orthon quest that would have given information)*

**Astarion:** To tell you the truth, I don't know whether we can defeat Cazador. Not unless we figure out more about what he's plotting.

**Astarion:** I think we should track down my fellow spawn. I'm not exactly looking forward to a reunion, but perhaps they'll know something.
