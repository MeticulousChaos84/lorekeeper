# Warning Against Helping the Orthon

**Context:** The player has indicated they might help the Orthon rather than kill it. This conflicts with Raphael's deal with Astarion.

---

**Astarion:** I hope you're not serious about helping that hellsbeast. We made a deal with Raphael - his destruction for the secrets written on my back.

## If the Player Reassures Him

**Astarion:** All right, if you say so...

## If the Player Suggests an Alternative Path

**Astarion:** What if there is no other way? What if this is it? Cazador did something to me - I need to know what it was. And the only way I'll know for sure is if that orthon dies.

*If the player continues to push back:*

**Astarion:** I see. So that's where we stand. Very well, then. We'll roll the dice and let's see what fate decides.

*Alternatively, if acknowledging it's Astarion's deal:*

**Astarion:** This is important. Do not play games with me.

### Alternative: If Scars Were Previously Read

**Astarion:** I'm a pawn in some game, but I need to know what we're playing. And the only way I'll know for sure is if that orthon dies.
