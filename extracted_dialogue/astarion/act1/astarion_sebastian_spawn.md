## [If Astarion Knows the Ritual's True Purpose]

*This path occurs if Raphael has already revealed the truth about the Rite of Profane Ascension.*

**Astarion:** I should have known what Cazador was capable of. He's played us for such fools.

**Astarion:** Not just seven spawn to placate the devil. Seven spawn, and *seven thousand souls* bound to them in blood.

**Astarion:** Everyone who ever trusted me enough to let down their guard... Innocents, idiots, and the unlucky.

**Astarion:** It doesn't matter. I will need to sacrifice them all if I want to perform the ritual.

### Player Choices: Confronting the Sacrifice

#### [Urging Mercy]

**Astarion:** What's the point? They're as good as dead. I thought they *were* dead.

**Astarion:** If they are unleashed, they will cause incredible carnage. They will be ravenous. They must die. Better they serve a purpose.

##### [If Romanced]

**Astarion:** Gods, I can't say you're wrong. I can only say I'm so glad we didn't meet then.

**Astarion:** I don't even want to think what would have happened to you...

**Astarion:** I would have killed you...

*[Alternative response if romanced]*

**Astarion:** Many of them are petty criminals, street drunkards and brothel-goers.

**Astarion:** But from time to time, there was a Sebastian...

*[Alternative response if romanced]*

**Astarion:** We have to kill Cazador. That has to come first.

##### [Offering Hope for Redemption]

**Astarion:** They're in a state far beyond anything that ever happened to me.

**Astarion:** Decades of hatred will have piled up inside of them. I can't even begin to imagine.

**Astarion:** We must find Cazador. This must end.

#### [Challenging His Choice]

**Astarion:** It should be. I don't want to be like them... They're pathetic, horrible...

**Astarion:** They do *not*. That weakness in me is dead. It's *dead*. I have a higher purpose.

*[Alternative response]*

**Astarion:** Don't hate me. I just did what I had to. I swear, I did what I had to.

#### [Emotional Manipulation]

**Astarion:** I know they will. I know I won't.

#### [Questioning His Feelings]

**Astarion:** It's just sickening, seeing them again. I don't know what else.

#### [Accepting His Choice]

**Astarion:** Thank you... Yes... this will all be over soon.

**Astarion:** It's just sickening, seeing them again. I don't know what else.

## [If Astarion Hasn't Learned the Ritual's Purpose Yet]

*This path occurs earlier in Act 3, before Raphael's revelation.*

**Astarion:** I feel ill. All the fools and villains who ever fell for my ploys... they're *here*.

### Questioning Why They're Alive

**Astarion:** He didn't do anything at all... I can't say the same of all my victims...

**Astarion:** But why, *why* does he need them alive? What possible use could they have in this ruined state?

**Astarion:** All the blood he demanded... I thought he was gorging himself on... He never could have finished half of it.

**Astarion:** He never let us drink, he never wanted us to know. I had no idea there was worse than drainage and death at his hand. I couldn't imagine.

**Astarion:** We must find Cazador. This must end.

*[Alternative response]*

**Astarion:** I could care less about that... I wonder if they'll tear me apart for what I did...

**Astarion:** We must find Cazador. This must end.

*[Alternative if player is dismissive]*

**Astarion:** Don't hate me. I just did what I had to. I swear, I did what I had to.

**Astarion:** We must find Cazador. This must end.

### Realization About the Ritual

**Astarion:** There's only one reason they'd all still be here... he must need them for the ritual.

**Astarion:** Each of the seven... we must have brought in a *thousand* over the decades...

**Astarion:** They're all lambs for his slaughter. And if I was to take his place... they'd all die by my hand.

*[Continues to main sacrifice conversation above]*

## Additional Reactions

**Astarion:** I don't know anymore. I thought these people were drained and buried. They *should* be dead.

**Astarion:** And I thought the nests in the kennels were bad... This lurked below...
