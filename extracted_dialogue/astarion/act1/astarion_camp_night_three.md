# Astarion: Camp - Third Night

**Location:** Camp (Wilderness)
**Act:** 1
**Context:** The third night in camp. Astarion lies on his bedroll looking at the stars - something novel after centuries confined to darkness. He becomes contemplative about whether their adventure will end soon, then gets uncomfortably close, paying hungry compliments. In truth, he's planning to return later and drink the player's blood. This scene sets up the bite confrontation.

## Stargazing

**Astarion:** Do you mind? I was rather enjoying my view of the ceiling.

*He lies on his bedroll, looking up.*

It's quite a sight. The stars, I mean. I could take or leave your chin.

---

## If Asked If They're Disturbing Him

**Astarion:** No, just thinking.

I can see the stars from Baldur's Gate, of course, but not with such clarity. It got me thinking.

---

## Reflections on Tomorrow

**Astarion:** Reflecting on what tomorrow might bring, when we find the druid.

Will he know how to bring the worm under control? Will this little adventure of ours be over?

## If the Player Says They Can Still Travel Together

*He gets up from his bedroll.*

**Astarion:** Good! I don't want you to run off just yet.

You're quite the ally, after all. Traversing Avernus. Surviving the crash. Surviving everything that's followed...

---

## If the Player Says They'll Leave When Cured

*He gets up from his bedroll.*

**Astarion:** A pity. A great pity.

You're quite the ally, after all. Traversing Avernus. Surviving the crash. Surviving everything that's followed...

---

## If the Player Asks If He'll Miss Them

*He gets up from his bedroll.*

**Astarion:** Ha! Why not?

You've been to the Hells and back. Survived the crash. Survived everything that's followed.

---

## The Compliments

*Astarion approaches, getting uncomfortably close.*

**Astarion:** I'm not easily impressed by people, but you're stronger than I gave you credit for.

---

### If the Player Says They Hardly Know Each Other

**Astarion:** You have your charms... more than you think.

*The Narrator notes: The smile on his pretty lips is a touch too composed, a bit too perfect. He may not mean a word he says.*

---

### If the Player Says They Thought He Didn't Like Them

**Astarion:** You have your charms... more than you think.

---

### If the Player Agrees They're Impressive

**Astarion:** Aren't you just...

---

### If the Player Says They're Just Trying to Survive

**Astarion:** Yes, we're more similar than I thought...

---

## If the Player Flirts

**Astarion:** A delicious thought, but...

---

### If Pressed

**Astarion:** The right moment...

...I'm sorry, I - I need to clear my head.

I'll see you later, I'm sure. Sleep tight.

---

## If the Player Asks If He's Feeling Alright

**Astarion:** Hmm? Oh, I was leagues away. I just need to...

...get some air. Clear my head.

I'll see you later, I'm sure. Sleep tight.

---

## If the Player Warns Him to Watch Himself

**Astarion:** Oh, you're no fun.

Sleep tight. I'll see you later, I'm sure.

---

## If the Player Says He's Too Close

*He doesn't move.*

**Astarion:** Of course. Terribly sorry.

I was just going anyway. I need to clear my head.

I'm sure I'll see you when I get back. Sleep tight.

---

## If the Player Tells Him to Stop Staring

**Astarion:** Was I? I just...

...I just need to get some air. Clear my head.

I'll see you later, I'm sure. Sleep tight.

---

## If Player Already Knows He's a Vampire

### If They Warn Him Not to Bite Again

**Astarion:** Heavens forbid. I've learned my lesson. I just...

...I just need to get some air. Clear my head.

I'll see you later, I'm sure. Sleep tight.

## Notes

This conversation is crucial setup for the bite confrontation that follows:

- The "Sleep tight. I'll see you later" is ominous foreshadowing - he's planning to return and feed
- His hunger is visible in the uncomfortable closeness, the lingering stares, the "hungry" quality to his compliments
- The passive Insight check (DC 7) reveals his insincerity - his charm is performance
- His compliments focus on the player's strength and survival, but really he's assessing them as prey
- Every exit line includes "I'll see you later" and "Sleep tight" - delivered with a smirk according to dev notes
- He's leagues away because he's planning his approach for later

The development notes explicitly state: "He's thinking about sneaking back into camp and drinking your blood tonight. Sleep tight should be said with a smirk."

This is Astarion at his most predatory before the bite scene forces him to confront what he's become.
