# Astarion: Camp - Second Night

**Location:** Camp (Wilderness)
**Act:** 1
**Context:** The second night in camp. Astarion is contemplating what happens if any of them begin to transform into mind flayers. As an experienced killer, he offers a morbid "professional courtesy" - asking how you'd prefer to die if it comes to that. He's enthusiastic when describing different methods, speaking as a connoisseur discussing his favorite subject.

## The Question of Transformation

**Astarion:** So. Not a tentacle to be seen. I'm hoping it'll stay that way.

Naturally. But I was thinking: what if it doesn't?

Of course, first sign of change and I'll have to stop that pretty little heart of yours.

I am open to suggestions. Knives, poison, strangulation - whatever you'd prefer.

## Choosing a Method

### If the Player Chooses a Knife

**Astarion:** A classic! One good thrust to the heart and you're gone.

We need a good blade, of course. Don't want to waste time hacking and prodding with a dinner knife...

Well, I'm getting ahead of myself. This is all a worst case scenario, obviously.

---

### If the Player Chooses Poison

**Astarion:** A fine choice! I can think of some nightshades that are deliciously fatal.

If they're mixed well, you'll just close your eyes and drift away. And if they're not...

Well, I'm getting ahead of myself. This is all a worst case scenario, obviously.

### If the Player Prefers Not to Die

**Astarion:** Well now you're just being close-minded. There are some lovely ways to go.

I've watched urchins freeze to death on the street. It looks peaceful - just like falling asleep.

Come on, humour me. If you had to choose...

### If the Player Asks About His Preference

**Astarion:** I don't think poison is for me. Nor stabbing, come to think of it.

*He considers this seriously, wondering if one can even poison a vampire.*

I've always felt decapitation was a fine choice. One good swing and then - nothing.

But we were talking about you. What'll it be?

---

### If the Player Chooses Decapitation

**Astarion:** A fine choice. Now, to use sword or axe? Or a saw? Hmm.

---

## If the Player Threatens Him

**Astarion:** Don't be so pig-headed, I'm being practical.

How much damage will you cause if you transform? How much blood can you bear to have on your hands?

---

### If the Player Threatens to Take Him Down Too

**Astarion:** Ha! I do like you, you know. You've got fire.

Whatever happens, I'll make the right choice.

Sweet dreams, darling.

---

### If the Player Stands Firm Against Choosing

**Astarion:** Then I suppose we'll just see what happens.

Don't worry, darling. I like you. I'm sure I'll make the right choice.

---

## Closing

**Astarion:** If the last day has taught me anything, it's that the impossible is more likely than you think.

Now, let's get some rest? The sooner we start tomorrow, the better our chances of keeping this hypothetical.

## If the Player Asks How to Kill Him

**Astarion:** Ha! Oh, my dear. I'd like to see you try.

Now, let's get some rest? The sooner we start tomorrow, the better our chances of keeping this hypothetical.

## Notes

This conversation reveals:
- Astarion's extensive experience with death and killing (he's watched people die in many ways)
- His clinical, almost enthusiastic approach to violence (describing methods like a connoisseur)
- The dark humor and gallows wit that characterizes his early interactions
- His genuine concern about ceremorphosis - he's already planning contingencies
- His choice of decapitation for himself is another vampire hint (one of the reliable ways to kill a vampire)
- Early signs of genuine interest in the player ("I do like you")

The "deliciously fatal" and "lovely ways to go" language establishes his unsettling comfort with death while maintaining his sophisticated charm.
