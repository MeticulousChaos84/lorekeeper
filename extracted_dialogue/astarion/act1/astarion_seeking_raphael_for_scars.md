# Seeking Raphael to Decipher the Scars

**Context:** Astarion wants to find Raphael to help translate the infernal writing on his back.

---

## Opening: After Seeing the Scars

**Astarion:** I've been thinking about the runes Cazador carved into my back.

### If the Scars Were Read and Identified as Infernal

**Astarion:** That fragment of a devil's contract or whatever the hells it is. I'm afraid that through those runes - somehow - Cazador might still be able to dominate me.

### If Knows They're Infernal (General)

**Astarion:** I don't know much about Infernal, but I know anything written in devilscript is going to be bad news. I'm afraid that through those runes - somehow - Cazador might still be able to dominate me.

### If Doesn't Yet Know What They Are

**Astarion:** There's something not right about all this. There's more to that 'poem' than everyday sadism. Maybe something *worse* than everyday sadism. I saw runes like that on the creatures we fought in the Hells. The message must be Infernal. I'm afraid that through those runes - somehow - Cazador might still be able to dominate me.

## Player Responses and Astarion's Plan

*The player can offer to examine the scars again, ask what he wants to do, or inquire about the other spawn.*

### If Haven't Been Intimate

**Astarion:** Unless you've suddenly become an expert in mysterious runes, I don't think that will achieve much. No, we need someone with a little more expertise. And I think I know who to ask.

### If Have Been Intimate

**Astarion:** Any excuse to get my shirt off, I see. But no, I don't think another viewing will serve any purpose. I need someone with a little more expertise.

### If Asking About Other Spawn

**Astarion:** Oh yes, we all got the same treatment. If there are other parts to this contract, I'm sure they'll be carved into the others. But I can't exactly stroll up and ask to look at their backs, can I? They're still under Cazador's clawed thumb. No, I thought I might ask someone else.

### If Player Offers Warlock Patron Help

**Astarion:** Oh no! I wouldn't want to bother your... intimidating companion. I had someone else in mind.

*Or:*

**Astarion:** I was thinking about someone a little more familiar, actually.

### Direct Answer

**Astarion:** Find an expert, of course. And I already have one in mind.

## Proposing Raphael

### If Knows About Infernal Contracts

**Astarion:** Our devilish friend - Raphael. If anyone's going to know about infernal contracts, he will.

### If Knows It's Infernal Text

**Astarion:** Our devilish friend - Raphael. If anyone's going to know about Infernal text, he will.

### General Version

**Astarion:** Our devilish friend - Raphael. If anyone has the resources to find out what it says, surely he will.

## Player Reactions to the Raphael Plan

*The player can express concern about dealing with a devil, agree pragmatically, warn about the price, or refuse involvement.*

**Astarion:** Well, you know what they say - better the devil you know.

*Or, if supportive:*

**Astarion:** I knew you'd see the pragmatic side!

*Or, when warned about price:*

**Astarion:** Well, we won't know until we ask, now, will we?

*Or, if player wants distance from the deal:*

**Astarion:** My friend, I'd never dream of it.

**Astarion:** Unfortunately, he comes and goes on his own schedule, so we'll just have to look out for any sulphurous odours or the sound of questionable poetry. Meanwhile I think I'll spend some time studying the art of infernal negotiations.

## Alternative Opening: In the Shadow-Cursed Lands (Before Scars Revealed)

**Astarion:** This dark land must be filled with the broken, the beaten, the desperate. The perfect preying ground for a devil who offers a way out for those who sign on the dotted line. I hope we end up seeing our friend Raphael down here somewhere.

*The player can ask why he wants to see Raphael, express reluctance, note Raphael isn't really a friend, or acknowledge the potential usefulness.*

**Astarion:** Help me find him, and you'll find out.

*Or:*

**Astarion:** *You* don't have to sign anything, just help me find him.

*Or:*

**Astarion:** I think he'll stay the perfect gentleman. As long as we read the fine print.

*Or, if player is supportive:*

**Astarion:** Precisely. Exactly.

**Astarion:** When I was taken to his House, I was caught off-guard. But now... Now I know what to ask for. You will help me find him, won't you?

*If the player agrees:*

**Astarion:** Perfect. I knew you would understand.

*If the player demands to know the plan first or criticizes the idea:*

**Astarion:** All in due time. But not now. I'm sure he'll turn up at one point or another.

*Or:*

**Astarion:** That's quite the achievement. But trust me. I know what I'm doing. I'm sure he'll turn up at one point or another.
