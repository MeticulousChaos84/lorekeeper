# Astarion: Cazador's History
**Location:** Camp
**Act:** 1
**Participants:** Astarion, Player
**Triggers:** Asking Astarion about Cazador after learning he's a vampire

---

**Astarion:** I suppose you want to hear about Cazador.

**Astarion:** My *old* master. Before the mind flayers took me from him. Before this strange, twisted freedom.

or

**Astarion:** I don't want to say a damned thing, but that won't do anyone any good.

**Astarion:** Cazador Szarr is a vampire lord in Baldur's Gate. The patriarch of his coven and a monster obsessed with power.

**Astarion:** Not political power or military power - I mean power over people. The power to control them completely.

**Astarion:** He turned me nearly two hundred years ago. I became his spawn and he became my tormentor.

**Astarion:** Not him, no. A gang of thugs attacked me, angry about a ruling that I'd handed down as magistrate.

**Astarion:** They beat me to death's door when Cazador appeared. He chased them off and offered to save me. To give me eternal life.

**Astarion:** Given that my choices were 'eternal life' or 'bleed to death on the street', I took him up on the offer.

**Astarion:** It was only afterwards I realised just how long 'eternity' could be.

## Path: The Tormentor's Methods

**Astarion:** He had me go out into Baldur's Gate to fetch him the most beautiful souls I could find.

**Astarion:** It was a fun little ritual of his - I'd bring them back and he'd ask if I wanted to dine with him. And if I said yes, he'd serve me a dead, putrid rat.

**Astarion:** Of course if I said no, he'd have me flayed. Hard to say which was worse.

## Path: A Vampire Spawn's Nature

**Astarion:** A vampire's spawn is less than a slave. They're a puppet.

**Astarion:** We have no choice but to obey our masters' commands. They speak and our bodies react - it's all part of the deal.

**Astarion:** Sometimes he'd order us to submit to torture. Sometimes he'd have us torture ourselves. Whatever his weathervane mood settled on.

## Concluding the Conversation

**Astarion:** Thank you, but this isn't about sympathy. It's about knowing what we might be up against.

**Astarion:** The mind flayers aren't the only monsters out there. They're not even the only ones hunting us. *(if the Gur hunter has already appeared)*

or

**Astarion:** The mind flayers aren't the only monsters out there. And they might not be the only ones hunting us. *(if the Gur hunter hasn't appeared yet)*

**Astarion:** All I'm asking is that you keep your eyes open. And watch out for anything lurking in the shadows.

**Astarion:** What more could I ask? Now, is that all?

## Alternative Path: Acceptance Without Discussion

**Astarion:** I will, but I won't take it for granted.

**Astarion:** The mind flayers aren't the only monsters out there. They're not even the only ones hunting us. *(if the Gur hunter has already appeared)*

## Alternative: Party Doesn't Know Astarion is a Vampire Yet

**Astarion:** I hope you're not here to ask about Cazador.

**Astarion:** No, I don't. The past is dead, so why exhume it when we have a nice, bright future ahead of us?

or

**Astarion:** And curious you'll remain. The past is dead, I'm not about to exhume it when there's a nice, bright future ahead of me.

**Astarion:** Assuming we don't turn into mind flayers, of course. That might put a bit of a damper on things.

**Astarion:** The point is, I'm looking forward. Focusing on what's important for our future.

**Astarion:** Exactly! So, was there anything else?

## Alternative: If Player Persists About His Past

**Astarion:** Spite made me who I am. Now let sleeping dogs lie, lest you get bitten.

---

## Alternative: If Player Questions His Trustworthiness

**Astarion:** Oh please, you think I'm the only one with secrets? At least you know there's something I'm not telling you.

**Astarion:** Trust me to do what's best for me - our fates are linked. I need you and you need me. It's that simple.

**Astarion:** And right now what's best for me is some quiet. Until later.

## Alternative: Party Knows Vampire Nature, Different Opening

**Astarion:** Now that you know what I am, I should tell you that Cazador was more than just a slaver.
