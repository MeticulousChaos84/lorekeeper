# Astarion at the Tiefling Celebration

**Location:** Camp, after saving the Tiefling refugees and defeating the goblin leaders
**Act:** 1
**Participants:** Astarion, Player
**Context:** After the party celebrating the defeat of the goblins, Astarion stands in a corner with a bottle of wine, in a bad mood. The celebration is too wholesome for his tastes.

---

## Opening: Too Heroic for His Liking

**Astarion:** You know, I never pictured myself as a hero. Never thought I'd be the one they toast for saving so many lives. And now that I'm here...

**Astarion:** I hate it. This is awful. *(swigs from the wine bottle and pulls a face - the wine tastes foul to him, though the complaint is about the party generally. He sets the bottle down on a table beside him)*

**Astarion:** We killed some goblins to save some tieflings. The tally of lives didn't change much. But what do I get for all my hard work? A pat on the head and vinegar for wine.

---

## Alternative: Player Tells Him to Enjoy Himself

**Astarion:** Enjoy myself? There's a worm in my brain, hunters on my trail, and all I've got to drink is wine that tastes like vinegar. *(if player met Gur hunter)*

or

**Astarion:** Enjoy myself? There's a worm in my brain, I'm surrounded by idiots, and all I've got to drink is wine that tastes like vinegar.

**Astarion:** That means I have to survive tonight. And this party.

---

## Alternative: Thinking of the Goblins

**Astarion:** True. That was fun. *(wistful, maybe with a giggle)* Still, I would've liked more for my trouble than a pat on the head and vinegar for wine.

---

## The Wine Tasting

**Narrator:** *It's a heavy, rich red - dry and sharp.* *(if player takes his bottle and tries the wine)*

**Astarion:** See what I mean? Awful. *(referring to the wine - to a vampire it tastes like muck, though to the player it tasted delicious)* All I want is a little fun. Is that so much to ask?

---

## Looking for Fun

**Astarion:** I'm just looking for a little more excitement. A little more fun.

**Astarion:** By the hells. Sex. Passion. *Fun.* *(can't believe how naive you are)*

---

## If Player Already Has a Partner

### With Lae'zel:

**Astarion:** It's easy for some. I see Lae'zel's marked you as her territory. *(slightly sulking/disinterested tone)* I just hope she leaves you in one piece. We can't take a tenday for you to recover from whatever her idea of 'fun' is.

**Astarion:** I'm sure it'll be adequate.

or

**Astarion:** Serious or not, it's something.

or

**Astarion:** Ha! No, my love, I'm not jealous of the beating our gith friend will give you. But you go ahead. Have *fun.* *(a hint of bitterness, but only a hint)*

### With Shadowheart:

**Astarion:** It's easy for some. You and Shadowheart seem to have a connection. It looks very sweet. *(slightly sulking/disinterested tone)* Not what I'd call 'passionate', or 'interesting', but sweet.

**Astarion:** Ha! No, my love, you and Shadowheart can get up to whatever you want. It means nothing to me. But you go ahead. Have *fun.* *(a hint of bitterness, but only a hint)*

### With Gale:

**Astarion:** It's easy for some, of course. You and Gale seem to be getting on very well. *(stress 'very' - slightly sulking/disinterested tone)* I wonder if he uses magic in the bedroom? That could go very well or very badly.

**Astarion:** Ha! No, my love, I'm not jealous of the walking encyclopaedia. But you go ahead. Have *fun.* *(a hint of bitterness, but only a hint)*

### With Wyll:

**Astarion:** It's easy for some, of course. You and Wyll seem to be getting on very well. *(stress 'very' - slightly sulking/disinterested tone)* Are you looking forward to seeing his 'Blade of Frontiers'? I hope it's more greatsword than dagger. *(teasing)*

**Astarion:** Ha! No. If he had an incubus instead of that cambion? That might be a different story. *(if Mizora's judgement scene happened)* But you go ahead. Have *fun.* *(a hint of bitterness, but only a hint)*

or

**Astarion:** Ha! No, I've seen enough blades in my time. *(innuendo for dicks)* But you go ahead. Have *fun.* *(a hint of bitterness, but only a hint)*

### With Karlach:

**Astarion:** It's easy for some, of course. You and Karlach seem to be getting on very well. *(stress 'very' - slightly sulking/disinterested tone)* It's none of my business, of course. I wouldn't want to intrude. Watch, maybe, but never intrude.

**Astarion:** Ha! No, my love, I'm not jealous of the tiefling. But you go ahead. Have *fun.* *(a hint of bitterness, but only a hint)*

## If Player is Available (No Partner, High Approval)

**Astarion:** By the hells. Sex, my dear. A night of passion. *(can't believe how naive you are)*

**Astarion:** Nothing so dramatic. Just you and me and - well, maybe a little death? Figuratively speaking. *(little death in the sense of orgasm)*

or

**Astarion:** Not at all! I was hoping for companionship and - well, maybe a little death. Figuratively speaking. *(little death in the sense of orgasm)*

**Astarion:** Don't be so sour. I like a good time as much as anyone. You know, we could always make our own entertainment, darling. Get a little closer, so to speak.

### The "Please" Persuasion Path:

**Astarion:** What? *(thrown - you've never been in this position before where someone demands you say please)*

**Astarion:** *Please.* *(through gritted teeth - if persuasion succeeds)*

**Astarion:** Cheeky little pup. I'll see you later.

or

**Astarion:** Will you now? Don't take too long. You're not the only tasty morsel here.

or

**Astarion:** Cheeky. I'll see you then.

### If Player Tries to Humiliate Him:

**Astarion:** You insolent little- Fine. Enjoy your night with whatever beast will have you. *(trying to suppress anger)*

or

**Astarion:** You are an insolent little pup, aren't you? *(kind of amused, kind of angry)* But have it your way. I'm happy to entertain myself.

### Agreeing to Meet:

**Astarion:** Well, that'd certainly spice up this evening. Let's wait until things quieten down. Once the others are asleep, we'll find each other.

**Astarion:** Indeed you will, my love. Indeed you will. *(response to "I'll see you later tonight" - player just agreed to hook up)*

or

**Astarion:** All right, but don't take too long. You're not the only tasty morsel around here.

### Declining After He Offers:

**Astarion:** Never listen to your second thoughts. They always spoil the fun. But fine. If you're determined to ruin your evening, I won't stop you.

or

**Astarion:** And here I mistook you for someone with taste. A pity. But have it your way. I'm happy to entertain myself.

---

## If Player is Available (Low Approval)

**Astarion:** Not with you, just to be clear. *(worried the player will think Astarion wants to have sex with them - they're not up to his standards)* I mean, can you imagine? Urgh. No. Anyway, don't let me keep you. I'm sure you have someone else to sniff around.

---

## If Player Flirts Despite Having Another Partner

**Astarion:** Do you think Lae'zel would approve? I saw how she looked at you earlier. *(teasing the player for their interest in another character)* I'd hate to get between the gith and her trophy. No, I think we'll end this evening as friends. *(pretending to be disinterested)*

or

**Astarion:** Do you think Shadowheart would approve? I saw how she looked at you earlier. *(teasing)* I don't know what her idea of a good time is, but it seems to involve you. I'd hate to intrude. *(pretending to be disinterested)*

or

**Astarion:** Do you think Gale would approve? I saw how he looked at you earlier. *(teasing)* No, I wouldn't want to get in the middle of whatever that is. We'll end tonight as friends. *(pretending to be disinterested)*

or

**Astarion:** Do you think Karlach would approve? I saw how she looked at you earlier. *(teasing)* No, I wouldn't want to get in the middle of whatever that is. We'll end tonight as friends. *(pretending to be disinterested)*

or

**Astarion:** Do you think Wyll would approve? I saw how he looked at you earlier. *(teasing)* No, I wouldn't want to get in the middle of whatever that is. We'll end tonight as friends. *(pretending to be disinterested)*

## Subsequent Conversations

**If player rejected him:**

**Astarion:** I hope you're not here to beg. It's so unbecoming. Funny, but unbecoming.

**If player agreed to meet:**

**Astarion:** You're eager, aren't you? But we need to wait a little longer. Once everyone's in their bedrolls, we'll slip out of ours and find each other.

**If player is with someone else:**

**Astarion:** Do you mind? I'm very busy. *(he's not very busy)*

**Astarion:** Are you now? Well, lucky her. *(disappointed)* Thank you so much for telling me. Now please do piss off. *(annoyed)*

or

**Astarion:** Are you now? Well, lucky him. *(disappointed)* Thank you so much for telling me. Now please do piss off. *(annoyed)*

**If player already spoke to him:**

**Astarion:** Having fun yet?

**If player turned him down earlier:**

**Astarion:** If you're looking for another shot, I'm afraid you've missed it.
