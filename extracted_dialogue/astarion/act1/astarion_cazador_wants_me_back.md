# Why Cazador Wants Him Back

**Astarion:** Why would Cazador want you alive? The hunter was a 'Gur'. Does that mean anything to you? Ha! Of course he'd send a Gur to hunt me down. He was a Gur, named Gandrel. A Gur? One of those vagabonds? Why would they - Cazador. Of course he'd send a Gur to hunt me down. Why? What's so special about the Gur people? Why? What's so special about the Gur people? Why? What's so special about the Gur people? It's - nothing. They're not special, they're just easy to buy and morally vacuous. Perfect lackeys. First, they make excellent monster hunters. So 'find a vampire spawn' sounds perfectly reasonable to them. Second, they're the reason I'm like this in the first place. It was a group of Gur that attacked me that night in Baldur's Gate. I would've died had Cazador not appeared and saved me. Saved you by turning you into a vampire slave? Well, he didn't mention the 'slave' clause at the time. And now he sends a Gur monster hunter for me? It's a message. He's reminding me of his power. Even in the middle of nowhere, he can reach me. And he wants me back.
