# Raphael's Revelation
**Location:** Camp
**Trigger:** Origin Astarion - after dealing with Yurgir in the Gauntlet of Shar
**Context:** Raphael arrives at camp to fulfill his bargain and reveal the truth about Astarion's scars

---

**Raphael:** Do you know what happens when a devil is struck down on this charming plane of existence? It returns to the hells - to the very point where it last stood before venturing to whichever devilforsaken plane it died on. In the case of our friend Yurgir, the orthon you so handily dispatched in the temple of Shar, he manifested in my House of Hope. He returned to me chastened but intact, his wounds healed, his body restored. He thought I would dismember him but he has his uses so instead I am *reeducating* him.

**Player (Origin Astarion):** We had a deal - the orthon for information.

*Or:*

**Player (Origin Astarion):** Please, give me more boring details about your plans.

**Raphael:** Come now, we're about to unveil your destiny - you should be quivering in anticipation.

*Or:*

**Player:** Stop stalling.

**Raphael:** As you wish. Brace yourself, Astarion - we're about to unveil your destiny. And why *would* he want to walk away? This is his destiny.

## The Ritual Revealed

**Raphael:** Carved into that ivory skin of yours is one part of an infernal contract between the archdevil Mephistopheles and your former master, Cazador Szarr. In full, the contract states that Cazador will be granted knowledge of an infernal ritual so vile it has never been performed. The Rite of Profane Ascension. It promises to be a marvellous ceremony. Very elaborate, incredibly ancient, and entirely diabolical. If he completes the rite, he will become a new kind of being - the Vampire Ascendant. All the strengths of his vampiric form will be amplified, and alongside them he will enjoy the luxuries of the living. The arousals and appetites of man will return to him, and unlike you, he will have no need of a parasite to protect him from the sun.

But the ritual has its price, as all worthwhile things do. Lord Cazador will need to sacrifice a number of souls, including all of his vampiric spawn, if he is to ascend. Imagine how he felt, then, when one of those precious spawn simply disappeared into thin air. You are the final piece he requires to complete the ritual - your scars bind you to it. Your soul will set off a very wave of death, bringing Cazador his twisted life.

And that, my tragic and toothsome friend, is that. Now if you'll excuse me, I have business elsewhere.

## Processing the Truth

**Astarion:** Hmm...

**Player:** Cazador is a piece of shit. We're going to stop him.

*Or:*

**Player:** 'Hmm'? That's all you have to say?

**Astarion:** I was... contemplating. It's a lot to take in. What do you think I should do?

**Player:** We can't let Cazador complete that ritual. He could unleash terrible horrors.

**Astarion:** The end of my life among them. Just when I was starting to enjoy it. He'll never leave me alone. I didn't think he would when I was just one more wretched toy for him to play with. But if I'm the key to this power he craves, he'll hunt me to the ends of Faerûn.

*Or:*

**Player:** I think you should run. If Cazador can't find you, he can't complete his ritual.

**Astarion:** How long do you think I can run? He has eternity to find me. He'll never leave me alone. I didn't think he would when I was just one more wretched toy for him to play with. But if I'm the key to this power he craves, he'll hunt me to the ends of Faerûn.

*Or:*

**Player:** You'll never be free while Cazador lives.

**Astarion:** I hate how right you are. I knew he wouldn't leave me alone even when I was just another wretched toy for him to play with. But if I'm the key to this power he craves, he'll hunt me to the ends of Faerûn.

*Or:*

**Player:** There's a way to become a living vampire... That must mean a lot to you.

**Astarion:** The idea definitely has appeal. I could get rid of the worm in my head and still walk in the sun. I'd finally be free of the hunger. And if I'm the key to this deal of Cazador's, perhaps I can turn this to my advantage...

## The Request for Help

**Astarion:** I need to take the fight to him. And I need you to help me.

**Player:** After we dealt with our tadpole problem, yes, I'll help you then.

**Astarion:** Once we deal with the tadpole, I'll be back to my nocturnal self. When you're being hunted by vampires, the dark is the worst place to hide. I need to deal with Cazador while I still have any kind of advantage over him.

*Or:*

**Player:** Of course I'll help. We'll hunt him down and kill him.

**Astarion:** Thank you.

*[+5 Astarion approval]*

*Or:*

**Player:** If he comes for you, I'll defend you. But we're not risking an attack on his lair.

**Astarion:** If you won't risk taking him on for my sake, think of the innocent souls he'll sacrifice in this ritual.

*Or:*

**Player:** Not a chance.

**Astarion:** If you won't risk taking him on for my sake, think of the innocent souls he'll sacrifice in this ritual.

**Astarion:** Fine.

## Alternative Initial Reactions

**Player:** You don't need to go back to Cazador - you're with me now.

**Astarion:** Do you think it's so simple? What do you think I should do?

*[Continues to player choice branches above]*

*Or:*

**Player:** You're... quiet. It's unsettling.

**Astarion:** It's a lot to take in. What do you think I should do?
