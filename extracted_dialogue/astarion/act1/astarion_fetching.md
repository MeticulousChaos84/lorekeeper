# Astarion - Fetching After Cazador Discovery

**Context:** Player found Cazador's palace and spoke with him without Astarion in the party, then returned to tell Astarion about it.

---

## Initial Confrontation

**Astarion:** You went after Cazador without me? And why in all the Hells would you do that?

### Response Path: Attempting to Help or Gather Information

**Astarion:** If you wanted to help, you should have asked me. This is too important for you to handle without me. But what's done is done. And if he's expecting you to bring me in, maybe we can turn this to our advantage.

#### If Player Cleared the Ballroom

**Astarion:** Especially if you've already cleared a path through the security he'd put in place. Well, that does make things easier.

#### If Ballroom Not Yet Cleared

**Astarion:** He won't throw the doors open for us, he's no fool, but there may be fewer obstacles in our path if he's expecting us. Because why would Cazador welcome you into his inner sanctum if his lackeys can kill you and deliver me to him? It's simply more efficient than killing you himself.

### Alternative Response Path: Payment Joke

**Astarion:** Very funny. If you're telling me this now, I assume it wasn't enough. But maybe this isn't so bad. Perhaps it could even work to our advantage.

## Player Questions About the Plan

### "Are you sure? It feels like a trap."

**Astarion:** Well of course it's a trap! But now we know it's a trap, and that's half the battle. Not literally, of course. The actual battle will be long and intense. But at least we have some idea of what we're walking into.

### "See? I knew what I was doing."

**Astarion:** You absolutely did not. But sometimes fortune shines on us all the same.

## Moving Forward

**Astarion:** Our next step is to get me to him. All you have to do is lead me to Cazador. I can handle him once we get there.

### Outcome 1: Player Agrees to Bring Him

**Astarion:** Thank you. I won't forget this. Let's do this. Let's go kill the bastard.

#### Alternative: Player Expresses Doubt

**Astarion:** It's not an issue of 'can', it's an issue of 'must'. I have to face him or I'll never be free. Let's do this. Let's go kill the bastard.

### Outcome 2: Player Asks Him to Wait at Camp

**Astarion:** You can't be serious. You want me to sit by the fire, twiddling my thumbs, when I could be winning my freedom?

#### If Unable to Leave (dangerous area/dimension)

**Astarion:** Even if I agreed to, I can hardly make it to our camp from here. At least for now, you're stuck with me.

#### If Able to Leave

**Astarion:** This is my fight. Don't you understand? I need to do this.

##### If Player Insists and Astarion Relents

**Astarion:** All right. I suppose you've earned a little trust. But only a little. I'll wait. For now.

### Outcome 3: Player Offers to Handle Cazador Alone

**Astarion:** You can't mean that. You want me to sit by the fire while you kill Cazador? This is my fight, don't you understand? It's not enough that he dies - I need to kill him.

*[Returns to choice: bring him along or convince him to wait]*
