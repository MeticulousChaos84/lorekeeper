# Astarion's Reaction to Meeting Raphael (Act 1)

**Context:** Astarion's dialogue after the party first encounters Raphael, who offered to help with the tadpole problem but told them to "shop around" first.

---

## Initial Reaction

**Astarion:** 'Shop around', he said. He seems sure we won't find anything.

*[If the party previously failed to get help from the hag]*

**Astarion:** Given that a hag couldn't solve our wriggling little problem, he might be right.

*[Otherwise]*

**Astarion:** And he might be right. We've had no luck so far.

---

## The Devil's Game

**Astarion:** I hope you're right, but I don't like this. He's playing with us.

*[If the party doesn't know Astarion is a vampire yet]*

**Astarion:** He reminds me of - well, someone I used to know. Someone that liked to play with people.

*[If the party knows about Cazador already]*

**Astarion:** Cazador liked to toy with people too. Let them think there was hope right until the end. Until he snatched it all away.

*[If mentioning Cazador for the first time]*

**Astarion:** Cazador, my old master, liked to toy with people too. Let them think there was hope right until the end. Until he snatched it all away.

**Astarion:** Creatures like them don't play games unless they know they can win.

## Alternative Reactions

### Determined Path

**Astarion:** Maybe, but he's not the only one spinning a web for us.

**Astarion:** This is no ordinary mind flayer parasite. Who tampered with it and why? What do they have planned for us?

**Astarion:** And why are we important enough that a devil comes knocking on our door? If we find those answers, we might have a chance.

### Pragmatic Path

**Astarion:** We keep hunting for answers. What other choice do we have?

**Astarion:** This is no ordinary mind flayer parasite. Who tampered with it and why? What do they have planned for us?

**Astarion:** And why are we important enough that a devil comes knocking on our door? If we find those answers, we might have a chance.

### Skeptical Path

**Astarion:** Oh, will you? Because you've got it all figured out, I'm sure.

**Astarion:** You know who tampered with the parasite. And why. And what they have planned for us.

**Astarion:** And of course you know why we're interesting enough that a devil would come to proposition us. Because if you don't know that, you may as well sign over your soul now.

**Astarion:** We may escape whatever web we're trapped in, but until we know what's going on, this Raphael has us exactly where he wants us.

### Wary Paths

*[If player suggests waiting to deal with the problem]*

**Astarion:** If we don't know what we're walking into, that bridge will collapse under us. The devil has a plan - he's playing with us.

*[If player dismisses the threat]*

**Astarion:** Maybe, but all that 'take your time, I'll wait' nonsense? He's playing with us.

*[If player suggests Astarion might make a deal]*

**Astarion:** I'm not about to trade a vampiric master for an infernal one. He's playing with us.

*[Or, if vampirism isn't known yet]*

**Astarion:** I'm not about to throw my soul away. He's playing with us.

## Warlock-Specific Dialogue

*[The following dialogue only occurs if the player character is a Warlock - included for context but not part of Erica's sorcerer playthrough]*

**Astarion:** It reminds me of Cazador, taunting his slaves with hope when he knew the game was rigged. *[Or: "It reminds me of my old master Cazador, taunting his slaves with hope when he knew the game was rigged." if first mention]*

**Astarion:** You're a warlock. You understand how dangerous the wrong deal can be.

*[If playing as Wyll origin]*

**Astarion:** I'm glad to hear it, although just being careful might not be enough.

**Astarion:** We have to figure out what's happening. Why we aren't changing, what's planned for us, and why a devil is suddenly taking an interest.

**Astarion:** If we can answer those questions, we might have a chance. And if not - well, we'll be exactly where this Raphael wants us.

*[Other warlock responses]*

**Astarion:** Indeed we can't. We have to figure out what's happening. Why we aren't changing, what's planned for us, and why a devil is suddenly taking an interest.

**Astarion:** If we can answer those questions, we might have a chance. And if not - well, we'll be exactly where this Raphael wants us.

*[Or]*

**Astarion:** You're not wrong. We have to figure out what's going on. Why we aren't changing, what's planned for us, and why a devil is suddenly taking an interest.

**Astarion:** If we can answer those questions, we might have a chance. And if not - well, we'll be exactly where this Raphael wants us.

*[Or, if player dismisses cambion as lesser threat]*

**Astarion:** Oh, can we? Because you've got it all figured out, I'm sure.

**Astarion:** You know who tampered with the parasite. And why. And what they have planned for us.

**Astarion:** And of course you know why we're interesting enough that a devil - pardon, a cambion - would proposition us. Because if you don't know that, you may as well sign over your soul now.

**Astarion:** We may escape whatever web we're trapped in, but until we know what's going on, this Raphael has us exactly where he wants us.
