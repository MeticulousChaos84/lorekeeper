**Location:** Camp
**Act:** 1
**Participants:** Astarion, Player
**Triggers:** Camp conversation, second night after the Nautiloid crash

---

**Astarion:** I saw you getting a lecture from our magical friend.

or

**Astarion:** Sounds like you've been learning all about your gruesome future.

or

**Astarion:** So. Not a tentacle to be seen.

or

**Astarion:** I saw our gith friend inspecting you.

**Astarion:** I have to say, I thought you'd look worse, but no. Not a tentacle to be seen.

**Astarion:** It's unexpected, but we shan't complain.

or

**Astarion:** Indeed you could. We're all doing surprisingly well, given the circumstances.

**Astarion:** I'm not taking anything for granted, of course. First sign of change and I'll have to stop that pretty little heart of yours.

or

**Astarion:** Naturally. But I was thinking: what if it doesn't? Of course, first sign of change and I'll have to stop that pretty little heart of yours.

or

**Astarion:** 'Yet'. Of course, first sign of change and I'll have to stop that pretty little heart of yours.

**Astarion:** I am open to suggestions. Knives, poison, strangulation - whatever you'd prefer. *(Professional courtesy)*

## Alternative: Choosing the Knife

**Astarion:** A classic! One good thrust to the heart and you're gone.

**Astarion:** We need a good blade, of course. Don't want to waste time hacking and prodding with a dinner knife...

**Astarion:** Well, I'm getting ahead of myself. This is all a worst case scenario, obviously.

**Astarion:** Obviously. But that won't happen. It can't.

or

**Astarion:** And you? How should I kill you?

**Astarion:** Ha! Oh, my boy. I'd like to see you try. *(if male player)*

or

**Astarion:** Ha! Oh, my dear. I'd like to see you try.

or

*Leave.*

**Astarion:** See you in the morning. Sweet dreams, darling.

**Astarion:** If the last day has taught me anything, it's that the impossible is more likely than you think.

**Astarion:** Now, let's get some rest? The sooner we start tomorrow, the better our chances of keeping this hypothetical.

---

## Alternative: Choosing Poison

**Astarion:** Poison, then. It should be painless at least.

or

**Astarion:** Poison? That sounds painless.

**Astarion:** A fine choice! I can think of some nightshades that are deliciously fatal.

**Astarion:** If they're mixed well, you'll just close your eyes and drift away. And if they're not... *('if they're not you'll die horribly.' is the unspoken end to that line.)*

**Astarion:** Well, I'm getting ahead of myself. This is all a worst case scenario, obviously.

**Astarion:** Obviously. But that won't happen. It can't.

or

**Astarion:** And you? How should I kill you?

**Astarion:** Ha! Oh, my boy. I'd like to see you try. *(if male player)*

or

**Astarion:** Ha! Oh, my dear. I'd like to see you try.

or

*Leave.*

**Astarion:** See you in the morning. Sweet dreams, darling.

**Astarion:** If the last day has taught me anything, it's that the impossible is more likely than you think.

**Astarion:** Now, let's get some rest? The sooner we start tomorrow, the better our chances of keeping this hypothetical.

## Alternative: Asking How Astarion Would Like to Die First

**Astarion:** Not sure. How would you like to go?

**Astarion:** I don't think poison is for me. Nor stabbing, come to think of it. *(He's wondering if you can even poison a vampire.)*

**Astarion:** I've always felt decapitation was a fine choice. One good swing and then - nothing.

**Astarion:** But we were talking about you. What'll it be?

**Astarion:** Decapitation sounds good, actually.

**Astarion:** A fine choice. Now, to use sword or axe? Or a saw? Hmm.

**Astarion:** Well, I'm getting ahead of myself. This is all a worst case scenario, obviously.

**Astarion:** Obviously. But that won't happen. It can't.

or

**Astarion:** And you? How should I kill you?

**Astarion:** Ha! Oh, my boy. I'd like to see you try. *(if male player)*

or

**Astarion:** Ha! Oh, my dear. I'd like to see you try.

or

*Leave.*

**Astarion:** See you in the morning. Sweet dreams, darling.

**Astarion:** If the last day has taught me anything, it's that the impossible is more likely than you think.

**Astarion:** Now, let's get some rest? The sooner we start tomorrow, the better our chances of keeping this hypothetical.

## Alternative: Refusing to Choose

**Astarion:** I'd prefer not to die.

**Astarion:** Well now you're just being close-minded. There are some lovely ways to go.

**Astarion:** I've watched urchins freeze to death on the street. It looks peaceful - just like falling asleep.

**Astarion:** Come on, humour me. If you had to choose...

**Astarion:** Poison, then. It should be painless at least.

**Astarion:** A fine choice! I can think of some nightshades that are deliciously fatal.

**Astarion:** If they're mixed well, you'll just close your eyes and drift away. And if they're not... *('if they're not you'll die horribly.' is the unspoken end to that line.)*

**Astarion:** Well, I'm getting ahead of myself. This is all a worst case scenario, obviously.

**Astarion:** Obviously. But that won't happen. It can't.

or

**Astarion:** And you? How should I kill you?

**Astarion:** Ha! Oh, my boy. I'd like to see you try. *(if male player)*

or

**Astarion:** Ha! Oh, my dear. I'd like to see you try.

or

*Leave.*

**Astarion:** See you in the morning. Sweet dreams, darling.

**Astarion:** If the last day has taught me anything, it's that the impossible is more likely than you think.

**Astarion:** Now, let's get some rest? The sooner we start tomorrow, the better our chances of keeping this hypothetical.

## Alternative: Firmly Refusing to Choose

**Astarion:** Come on, humour me. If you had to choose...

**Astarion:** I *don't* have to choose.

**Astarion:** Then I suppose we'll just see what happens.

**Astarion:** Don't worry, darling. I like you. I'm sure I'll make the right choice.

---

## Alternative: Wanting Someone Else to Do It

**Astarion:** Come on, humour me. If you had to choose...

**Astarion:** I'd rather have one of the others do it.

or

**Astarion:** Then I'll ask someone else to do it.

**Astarion:** Oh, I see how it is.

**Astarion:** Fine, but if they botch it - don't come bleeding to me.

---

## Alternative: Being Defensive

**Astarion:** Try it and I'll spill your guts.

**Astarion:** Don't be so pig-headed, I'm being practical.

**Astarion:** How much damage will you cause if you transform? How much blood can you bear to have on your hands?

**Astarion:** I can bear a lot.

**Astarion:** So can I.

**Astarion:** I like you. Rest assured, whatever happens, I'll make the right choice.

**Astarion:** Sweet dreams, darling.

## Alternative: Threatening to Take Him Down Too

**Astarion:** Try it and I'll spill your guts.

**Astarion:** Don't be so pig-headed, I'm being practical.

**Astarion:** How much damage will you cause if you transform? How much blood can you bear to have on your hands?

**Astarion:** If I *had* to choose, I'd want the knife. Make it quick.

**Astarion:** A classic! One good thrust to the heart and you're gone.

**Astarion:** We need a good blade, of course. Don't want to waste time hacking and prodding with a dinner knife...

**Astarion:** Well, I'm getting ahead of myself. This is all a worst case scenario, obviously.

**Astarion:** Obviously. But that won't happen. It can't.

or

**Astarion:** And you? How should I kill you?

**Astarion:** Ha! Oh, my boy. I'd like to see you try. *(if male player)*

or

**Astarion:** Ha! Oh, my dear. I'd like to see you try.

or

*Leave.*

**Astarion:** See you in the morning. Sweet dreams, darling.

**Astarion:** If the last day has taught me anything, it's that the impossible is more likely than you think.

**Astarion:** Now, let's get some rest? The sooner we start tomorrow, the better our chances of keeping this hypothetical.

## Alternative: Poison After Being Defensive

**Astarion:** Try it and I'll spill your guts.

**Astarion:** Don't be so pig-headed, I'm being practical.

**Astarion:** How much damage will you cause if you transform? How much blood can you bear to have on your hands?

**Astarion:** Poison, then. Something painless.

**Astarion:** A fine choice! I can think of some nightshades that are deliciously fatal.

**Astarion:** If they're mixed well, you'll just close your eyes and drift away. And if they're not... *('if they're not you'll die horribly.' is the unspoken end to that line.)*

## Alternative: Mutual Threat Acknowledgment

**Astarion:** Try it and I'll spill your guts.

**Astarion:** Don't be so pig-headed, I'm being practical.

**Astarion:** How much damage will you cause if you transform? How much blood can you bear to have on your hands?

**Astarion:** If I die, I'll take you with me.

**Astarion:** Ha! I do like you, you know. You've got fire.

**Astarion:** Whatever happens, I'll make the right choice.

**Astarion:** Sweet dreams, darling.
