# Astarion - Act 3 Location Topical Greetings

These are one-off greetings that trigger when entering specific locations in Act 3.

---

## Wyrm's Crossing

**Astarion:** Wyrm's Crossing - the 'Welcome' mat of Baldur's Gate. This is it. I'm almost home.

---

## Iron Throne

**Astarion:** I thought I knew what it was like to be a prisoner, but this place is something else entirely.

---

## Steel Watch Foundry

**Astarion:** The stink of oil, the clank of gears - this place is revolting.

---

## House of Hope

**Astarion:** You know, for all the sense of dread and horror seeping through this place, I really feel quite at home here.

---

## Burning Tavern (Sharess' Caress)

**Astarion:** Careful not to inhale too much smoke, your lungs won't appreciate it. Not a worry for those of us who don't breathe, of course.
