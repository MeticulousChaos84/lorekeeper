# Astarion - Dream Visitor and Emperor Topical Greetings

Astarion's reactions to the Dream Visitor and the Emperor's reveal.

---

## First Dream Visit

**Astarion:** I had the strangest dream last night. There was a visitor promising me protection, and all sorts of delicious powers from the parasites in our heads. Given our shared affliction, I suppose you had a similar dream...?

**Astarion:** Excellent! Now we can see what these tadpoles can do for *us*.

## Second Dream - Mission Statement

**Astarion:** I had another visit from that dream figure. I take it you did too? It claims that if we infiltrate the heart of the cult that's giving out these parasites, we'll find the answers we're looking for. It gave me another gift, too. Just like it did the first time it appeared. Rather generous, if you ask me.

## Emperor's Reveal

**Astarion:** So, we owe our lack of tentacles to one of the very creatures that kidnapped us. And now it's offering us power. If we're willing to 'evolve'.

## Choosing What to Do with Emperor

**Astarion:** I don't envy the choice that mind flayer gave you, but for what it's worth, I think you did the right thing.
