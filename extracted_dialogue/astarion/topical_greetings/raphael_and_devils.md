# Astarion - Raphael and Devils Topical Greetings

Astarion's reactions to encounters with Raphael and other devils.

## First Meeting with Raphael

**Astarion:** Now there's a bloody devil trailing after us? This gets better and better. 'Shop around', he said. He seems sure we won't find anything. Given that a hag couldn't solve our wriggling little problem, he might be right.

**Astarion:** I hope you're right, but I don't like this. He's playing with us.

**Astarion:** Cazador liked to toy with people too. Let them think there was hope right until the end. Until he snatched it all away.

**Astarion:** Creatures like them don't play games unless they know they can win.

**Astarion:** Maybe, but he's not the only one spinning a web for us. This is no ordinary mind flayer parasite. Who tampered with it and why? What do they have planned for us? And why are we important enough that a devil comes knocking on our door? If we find those answers, we might have a chance.

## Declining Raphael's Deal

**Astarion:** Useful as the hammer would have been, I'm relieved we're not in the devil's debt. Once his kind has you under their thumb, they won't ever let you go.

## Defeating Raphael

**Astarion:** Ha! Defeating a devil in his own home feels very, very good, actually.
