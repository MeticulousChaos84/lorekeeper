# Astarion - Gale Reactions Topical Greetings

Astarion's reactions to Gale's situation, orb, and choices.

---

## Gale Recruited

**Astarion:** So, we've picked up a wizard who managed to get stuck in his own portal? Hardly a promising introduction.

---

## Gale Consumes Magic Items

**Astarion:** I've known people who were hungry for power, but Gale takes it a bit too literally for my liking. I wonder how he does it. Why he does it. I'm sure all will be revealed in time, but I don't like it. A waste of perfectly good treasure.

---

## Learning About Gale's Orb

**Astarion:** To think, Gale's had this devastating orb within himself the entire time, but only just mentioned it? Who'd keep a secret like that from his friends? You can't trust anyone these days.

---

## Elminster's Visit - Mystra's Command

**Astarion:** The parasite must be playing with my ears, because I was sure that beardy tramp told Gale to find the Heart of the Absolute and then *blow himself up*. To think, he's had that orb within him this whole time and never told us. Who'd keep a secret like that from his friends? You can't trust anyone these days.

---

## Mystra's Command (Gale Knows)

**Astarion:** I can't believe Mystra's demanding Gale sacrifice himself to destroy the Absolute. It's just a waste of a perfectly good cult that we could be controlling. And a waste of a perfectly good Gale, I suppose.

---

## Gale Resurrection

**Astarion:** It's quite a trick, coming back from the dead. If only we were all so lucky.

---

## Gale Crafted Dark Lantern

**Astarion:** I have to admit, I am impressed with Gale and his new lantern. Being willing to turn away from what he knew and bending the darkness to his will? Wonderful to see. And of course the dead pixies were just a lovely touch.

---

## Gale Blessed by Mystra

**Astarion:** What a waste - Gale could have had a taste of real power. Instead he bowed to the will of his god and traded it for a sad little boon. Pathetic.

---

## Gale Consumes Shadow Weave

**Astarion:** Good to see Gale's willing to do what it takes to get power. Even if it means defying the gods themselves.

---

## Gale Hedging Bets with Mystra

**Astarion:** So, Gale's hedging his bets with Mystra. I can't say I blame him.

---

## Gale Refuses to Return Crown

**Astarion:** Defying Mystra, declaring that he'll rule the Karsite Weave - I didn't know Gale had it in him.

---

## Gale Kidnapped by Orin

**Astarion:** So, we kill Gortash or Gale dies? It's not an easy call. One the one hand, killing Gortash would be fun. On the other, Gale can be very annoying. We probably should save the wizard, though. He does have his moments.

---

## Mystra Requests Meeting in Baldur's Gate

**Astarion:** So, Mystra's requested a chat with you? Unusually polite for a god. I do hope it goes well. We've pissed off enough gods already.
