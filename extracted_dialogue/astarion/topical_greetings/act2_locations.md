# Astarion - Act 2 Location Topical Greetings

These are one-off greetings that trigger when entering specific locations in Act 2.

---

## Shadow-Cursed Lands (First Entrance)

**Astarion:** It feels like we're being watched - hunted, even - but there's nothing out there, only more darkness. I much prefer it when I'm the one prowling in the shadows, about to strike. Sorry - did you want something? Or just looking for a distraction?

---

## Shadowfell

**Astarion:** Just when you think your day can't get any stranger, you end up traipsing around an impossible-looking shadow dimension. Honestly, just once could we end up somewhere normal? A tavern maybe? Or a nice, friendly brothel? I'd take anything at this rate.

---

## Shar Temple

**Astarion:** This temple certainly is grand. Well, it's a 'run down, bearing the weight of centuries' sort of grand. Which is my favourite kind, incidentally.

---

## Shar Grotto

**Astarion:** This place is miserable, even for the house of a god.

---

## Moonrise Towers (First Entrance)

**Astarion:** So, this is the abode of our dear Absolute? It's about as cheerful as expected.

---

## Moonrise Oubliette

**Astarion:** I do admire the décor here. It's more tasty than tasteful, but I'll take what I can get.

---

## Moonrise Assault

**Astarion:** There's a time for talking and a time for killing. This, my friend, is the latter.
