# Astarion - Act 1 Event Topical Greetings

Astarion's reactions to major events in Act 1.

---

## Nere Trapped in Grymforge

**Astarion:** So, are we saving this 'Nere' from suffocating or leaving him to die? I'm fine with either, naturally. The last thing I want is to ruin these nails digging through rock.

---

## Following the Drider

**Astarion:** That drider's mad as a box of gremishkas. Then again, you'd have to be mad to spend your days marching through this gloom.

---

## Using the Zaithisk

**Astarion:** I'm not surprised that the gith's insane device didn't remove our tadpoles. I'm just disappointed.

---

## Stopping the Creche Destruction

**Astarion:** Obviously I'm glad we didn't level the monastery with that sun cannon. But... Come on, you can't say you weren't a little curious to see what would happen?

---

## Vlaakith Commands Artifact Destruction

**Astarion:** Well, this is exciting. It's not every day you get to speak to a god-queen. Much less be bossed around by one.

---

## Learning About Orphic Hammer

**Astarion:** Should I be surprised that the key to freeing this gith prince is a hammer? It's as subtle and elegant as everything the gith do.

---

## Githyanki Artifact Encounter

**Astarion:** If the gith are looking for that artefact, then we may have something valuable on our hands. And it's a powerful weapon to boot? Things are starting to look very interesting...
