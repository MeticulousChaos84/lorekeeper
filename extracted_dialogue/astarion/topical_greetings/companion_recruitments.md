# Astarion - Companion Recruitment Topical Greetings

Astarion's reactions to recruiting new companions.

---

## Lae'zel Recruited

**Astarion:** I am enjoying the latest addition to our little group - Lae'zel is delightful. In a very 'look at me twice and I'll dismember you' kind of way, of course.

---

## Wyll Recruited

**Astarion:** So, we're travelling with the famed 'Blade of Frontiers'. I feel safer already.

---

## Karlach Recruited

**Astarion:** I knew we were a strange band, but a fugitive from the Hells? Now that's someone worth knowing. Not that I want to get on the wrong side of any devils, but this Karlach is a survivor. Plus, I appreciate anyone who opens a conversation with threats of bodily harm.

---

## Karlach and Wyll Camp Drama

**Astarion:** I thought we were going to see some real sparks fly between Wyll and Karlach. It's almost a pity things ended so amicably, seeing those two duke it out would be fun.

---

## Karlach and Wyll - Confrontation Alternative

**Astarion:** Nothing like a little camp drama to spice up the evening. It's almost a pity things ended so amicably, seeing those two duke it out would be fun.

---

## Wyll Gets Horns (Spared Karlach)

**Astarion:** So, Wyll did the right thing and it earned him a set of horns. Let that be a lesson to us all.

---

## Karlach Second Upgrade

**Astarion:** So, the untouchable Karlach is untouchable no more. I'd shake her hand, but she can still snap me in two, so... probably safest to skip it.

---

## Halsin Recruited

**Astarion:** I think I'll enjoy travelling with Halsin. Not for his wit or wisdom - he'll just make an excellent shield if we're attacked.

---

## Jaheira Burned Scroll

**Astarion:** Jaheira has steel in her, I'll say that. It's not easy to walk away from immortality. Most people would have held on to that scroll for as long as they could bear to. And probably a century or two longer than that.

---

## Minsc Recruited

**Astarion:** So, we can add one bald wall of muscle to our little group. I'm sure he'll come in handy. Maybe as a doorstop.

---

## Minsc Escapes Counting House

**Astarion:** Minsc puts on quite a show of brawn. Even if there's no brain worth mentioning. I mean, I hate to judge the proverbial book, but that oaf may be all cover and no pages.

---

## Minsc Not Saved (Emperor Kills Him)

**Astarion:** Killing that giant oaf was the right thing to do. Even if it meant losing the Harper.
