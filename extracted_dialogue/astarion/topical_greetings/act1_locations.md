# Astarion - Act 1 Location Topical Greetings

These are one-off greetings that trigger when entering specific locations in Act 1.

---

## Druid Grove

**Astarion:** Well, this seems like a lovely little spot. The sense of impending doom aside.

---

## Goblin Camp

**Astarion:** Ah, drink it in - that sweet, sweet chaos. Not that I approve of goblins, of course - filthy little beasts - but I do like a good den of debauchery.

---

## Hag's Lair

**Astarion:** I've been in more unsettling places than this, but not many.

---

## Underdark

**Astarion:** So this is the Underdark? I've always heard stories, but never thought I'd end up slumming it down here. Although it must appeal to anyone with an aversion to the sun, so I suppose it has its upsides. Or it's... undersides? Because it's - you know what I mean.

## Githyanki Creche (After Leaving)

**Astarion:** The sooner we get out of this gith warren, the better.

---

## Mind Flayer Colony

**Astarion:** This place brings back the worst memories. It's like being kidnapped all over again.
