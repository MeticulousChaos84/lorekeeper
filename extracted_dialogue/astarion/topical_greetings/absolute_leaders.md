# Astarion - Absolute Leaders Topical Greetings

Astarion's reactions to encounters with Gortash, Orin, and Ketheric.

---

## Gortash Warns About Impostor

**Astarion:** So, we have a shapechanger at our camp? Good luck finding her. You could watch out for anyone acting strangely, but... well, you know the lunatics we camp with.

---

## Orin Met (Shapeshifted)

**Astarion:** It's not enough we have a gallery of villains to look out for, but now we could be infiltrated by a shapechanger? I can't even tell if any of you are acting strange because you've been replaced or because this group is full of weirdos.

## Gortash Defeated

**Astarion:** There's one more stone in our pockets, which means one step closer to glory. Or however this sordid tale ends. I wouldn't want to presume.

---

## Orin Defeated

**Astarion:** Good riddance to the shapechanger. Couldn't have happened to a worse wretch.

---

## Murder Tribunal Completed

**Astarion:** The Amulet of Bhaal. It's hardly a triumph of fashion, but it does have its uses.

---

## Arrived at Morphic Pool

**Astarion:** At last. Time to enjoy a little vengeance.
