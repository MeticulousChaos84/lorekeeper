# Elminster's Visit - Mystra's Command
**Location:** Camp
**Act:** 2 (Shadow-Cursed Lands or Creche)
**Participants:** Gale, Elminster
**Triggers:** After giving Gale at least one magic item; Elminster appears and sends party to camp for overnight conversation

---

**Weary Traveller (Elminster):** Hmm, yes. This shall suffice. *(glancing around at the general camp area)*

**Weary Traveller:** Ah, finally he stirs. True adventurers get up with the lark, I always say, but if there are larks to be found in these lands, they must fancy themselves akin to nightingales.

**Narrator:** *Your previous encounter with the old wizard was most likely a simulacrum - the figure before you may well be too.*

**Weary Traveller:** I took the liberty of enlisting your cadaverous co-traveller to revive you. You truly should take much better care of yourself, m'boy.

**Gale:** Elminster?

**Weary Traveller:** The very same, Gale. And a fair bit miffed he is, too, finding himself forced to expose his best pair of boots to so many miles of country road on your behalf.

**Weary Traveller:** Don't just gawp at me like the dregs of the fishmonger's stall - I've worn out quite some boot leather in order to track you down.

**Weary Traveller:** I was bid to spare neither time nor my own self to find you. *She* sent me, Gale. You know of whom I speak.

**Gale:** Mystra sent you? Why?

**Weary Traveller:** Young man, has your sojourn away from Waterdeep washed away your decorum as well as your patience?

**Weary Traveller:** But I suppose, after all the calamity that's been laid at your feet, you can be forgiven raw nerves and a sharp tongue...

**Weary Traveller:** Gale, m'boy, I've come to address a most pressing matter. I'll speak as plainly as I can, forswearing the accustomed frills that decorate my speech.

**Weary Traveller:** Mystra - the message and the charge I bring you are hers.

**Weary Traveller:** You know where you went wrong, Gale. We needn't dwell on that here and now. But even so, you're to be given a chance of redemption.

**Gale:** Mystra would consider... forgiveness? *(a little hopeful)*

**Weary Traveller:** She would consider what she considers to be forgiveness.

**Weary Traveller:** Mystra is aware of the misadventures that have befallen you both. She knows of your strife with the Absolute, that most insidious of evils.

**Weary Traveller:** You must know that the Absolute is more dangerous than you can possibly conceive. It threatens all who live - even those who are undying. It threatens the gods, the Weave, the very fabric of the universe itself.

**Weary Traveller:** That is why I have come here to charge you, Gale, with its destruction. It is Mystra's belief that only you can.

**Gale:** You mean the orb. You mean I sacrifice myself. *(weary resignation - he's being asked on a suicide mission)*

**Weary Traveller:** As you say.

**Weary Traveller:** The orb. That constant reminder of your past failings. The instrument of your slow, sad, *inevitable* destruction. It can instead redeem you.

**Weary Traveller:** Mystra has granted me the power to stop the clock, as it were, on the orb's rush to overpower you. Instead, you will be able to unleash its lethal combustion at will.

**Weary Traveller:** You must find the Heart of the Absolute, whatever that may be, and use yourself as the catalyst that will burn it from this world.

**Gale:** I am Mystra's servant. If this is what she asks of me, so be it.

**Weary Traveller:** Your clear-mindedness is a testament to yourself, Gale.

**Weary Traveller:** With that, I've said my sorry piece, and need only bestow unto thee the charm I was bid.

**Weary Traveller:** My'Nahastra Mystra'Ryl. E'Deelion Thras'Anas'Tthra. *(disarming the orb - gesturing towards Gale's heart with an open palm, moving his hand in a small circular motion, as if soothing or containing the orb within)*

**Weary Traveller:** It is done. Both charge and charm have been committed into your care.

**Weary Traveller:** A shame that we did not cross paths sooner. The orb's thirst for magic is now quenched, yet it already inflicted some damage while you tried to forge ahead.

**Weary Traveller:** The ill effects may linger, I'm afraid. Not enough to hamper your mission, I hope.

**Weary Traveller:** Like moons make swell and wane the nescient seas, so too the sky-strewn gods ordain the tidal fates of mortal days.

**Weary Traveller:** And yet - a notion born in lonely hours - come ebb, come flow, come all that is beyond the breadth of our dominion: be a moon unto yourself.

**Weary Traveller:** Even the waves of fate can break upon the shores of will.

**Weary Traveller:** Farewell, my friend.

## Alternative Response Path: Questioning the Cost
---

**Gale:** That's the cost of Mystra's good graces? *Martyrdom?*

**Weary Traveller:** Remember who she is, Gale. Mortal death is but a passing chapter to a goddess - and to those who win her favour.

**Weary Traveller:** Whatever she can grant unto you is infinitely better than whatever you cling to now.

*(continues to charm bestowal as above)*

## Alternative Response Path: No Other Choice
---

**Gale:** What other choice do I have?

**Weary Traveller:** You could flee from Mystra's calling. Live the life of a hermit once again, and succumb to the orb all the same. Only, it will be a death without purpose.

**Weary Traveller:** It brings me no pleasure saying this, my friend, but such is Mystra's will. Yours must be the sacrifice that will undo the Absolute. And for your sacrifice, you will be redeemed - such is Mystra's promise.
