OverviewWaterdeep: City Encounters presents over a hundred short encounters to bring the City of Splendors to life at your gaming table. The supplement comprises the following sections:• Random City Encounters. Dozens of random encounters for every ward in the city.   • Location Encounters. An encounter for almost every location mentioned in the city guide of Waterdeep: Dragon Heist.• Appendix 1. Waterdeep Weather . T ables for determining the weather in Waterdeep for all four seasons. • Appendix 2. Monster & NPC Statistics. Statistics for creatures listed in Volo’s Guide to Monsters or Waterdeep: Dragon Heist.Waterdeep: City Encounters requires use of the D&D ﬁfth edition core rulebooks (Player’s Handbook, Dungeon Master’s Guide, and Monster Manual). When a creature’s name appears in bold type, that’s a reference to its stat block in the Monster Manual. If the creature is listed in Volo’s Guide to Monsters or Waterdeep: Dragon Heist, its stat block is reproduced with permission in appendix 2. ForewordI’!" /A.sc/L.sc%/A.sc&' ("") /A.sc (/I.sc+ ,- /A.sc ./I.sc+& (,&. M& upbringing in London and T okyo taught me to appreciate urban life for its diversity and unpredictable edge. It’s no surprise that my ﬁrst Dungeons and Dragons campaigns took place in imaginary cities.Waterdeep represents everything I love about city life: boundless opportunity, rich history, communal pride, and the constant sense of danger just around the corner. Chapter 9 of Waterdeep: Dragon Heist paints a vivid picture of this legendary metropolis, providing all the background you need to begin your own adventures in the city. With Waterdeep: City Encounters, I hoped to bring the city to life on your gaming table with over a hundred short encounters you can pull at any time as your group explores.For this endeavor, I recruited my own gang from the ranks of the Guild Adepts and let them loose on the wards of Waterdeep. I think you’ll like what they found. Will DoyleSeptember 2018

4PART ONE | RANDOM CITY ENCOUNTERS
Most encounters occur during business hours, which run late in most wards. No tables are provided for the dead of night, as the city sleeps during these hours and the streets are empty save for lamplighters and City Watch patrols. All encounters are reusable if rolled more than once.This section also includes four randomized tables: Random Factions, Random Guilds, Random Goods, and Waterdeep Rumors. Use these as directed by the text, or as needed to add color and ﬂavor to your own adventures.

Such encounters add mystery, intrigue, and danger to exploration, reinforcing the impression that the characters are never truly alone, and that urban life continues around them.Roll for random encounters as often as you like. Good times to roll are when the characters move between locations, or each time they enter a new ward. The encounters here are balanced for characters of levels 1-4, but dangerous outliers do feature.

6PART ONE | RANDOM CITY ENCOUNTERSA M&1d4 rabble-rousing thugs lead an angry mob of 2d12 commoners through the streets, chanting political slogans, vandalizing storefronts, or otherwise causing upset. Roll a d4 to determine who they are:1. Hooligans from the Guild of Butchers drag a halﬂing pie-maker through the streets. As punishment for selling unlicensed scotched eggs, the vigilantes have dipped the halﬂing in butter and rolled him in mince and breadcrumbs.2. Frustrated drivers from the Fellowship of Carters & Coachmen barricade the street to protest the growing popularity of double-decked dray carriages. The drivers are upturning a passing dray carriage when the characters arrive, much to the consternation of its passengers.3. Storekeepers rally against the proposed "Door Levy", which taxes business owners for every door in their premises. The protestors rip the doors from every storefront that refuses to donate to their cause.4. Youthful agitators protest the anonymity a3orded to the Lords of Waterdeep. They surround anyone wearing a mask and try to tear it from their face. Ironically, the agitators wear masks to hide their identities from the authorities.A''('')()A passing ﬁgure drives a dagger into another person’s back and then ﬂees the scene. Roll a d4 to determine who they are:1. T wo sisters embroiled in a long-running legal dispute over the modest estate left by their father.2. The victim was a lawyer involved in the prosecution of a powerful gangster. Her assailant is an assassin who was sent to silence her.3. The assailant was forced to commit the murder because of a geas cast by a wicked enchanter, who harbored a grudge against the victim after she rejected his romantic advances.4. The assailant is a cambion who has recently come to the city and takes sadistic delight in attacking random strangers.A(. TThe characters come across a tree laden with ripe apples, regardless of season. The tree bears a sign that reads "Please pick an apple." Numerous items are piled around its roots, from colorful scarves to a coin pouch containing 17 cp. Any creature taking an apple from the tree must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or be compelled to leave a random possession at the tree’s base and forget they ever owned it. Anyone who tries to take one of the items is walloped by the awakened tree.B T).A fermenter full of beer in a nearby brewery bursts and hundreds of gallons of golden elixir churn into the streets! The ﬂash ﬂood jeopardizes one or more of the locals! Roll a d4 to ﬁnd out who is a3ected or choose up to four results.1. The ﬂood has washed a young child away from his mother and is carrying him toward an open manhole 60-feet away from the group. Any character who wades over to the drain and succeeds on a DC 9 Strength (Athletics) check can yank the child from the ﬂood before it washes him into the sewers.2. A trio of City Watch guards were arresting a criminal when the ﬂood occurred. In the confusion, the bandit escaped and is now running towards the characters. If the characters capture the ne'er-do-well, they earn the thanks of the City Watch. T o the contrary, if they help her escape, she may repay them when they least expect it.3. An old woman's ﬂower cart has toppled over in the ﬂood. While the cart is mostly intact, all her ﬂowers have been lost: as has her livelihood. 5 gp is enough for her to restock, and she’s extremely thankful if the characters help in such a way. Alternatively, the characters can seek out the miserly owner of the brewery and attempt a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check to solicit compensation.4. The ﬂood rushes towards the characters! Characters who succeed on a DC 9 Dexterity (Acrobatics) or Strength (Athletics) check are able to jump out of the way or clamber up a nearby street lamp. Characters who fail are washed down the street, taking 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage and ending up covered in sticky, half-fermented beer.B(A middle-aged lightfoot halﬂing wererat named Larca Shineforth approaches the characters in her humanoid form, begging for coin. If the group contains halﬂings, any character who succeeds on a Wisdom (Perception) check opposed by Larca's Dexterity (Stealth) check notices she’s been following them at a distance. Larca is sizing up them up for recruitment to the “Shard Shunners”, a gang of halﬂing wererats of which she is a member.Larca singles out any halﬂing character who displays competency in Dexterity-based ability checks or Charisma-based ability checks. She waits until she can speak with that halﬂing alone, and then promises them great power in return for loyalty to her gang. Whether or not the character accepts, Larca transforms into her hybrid form and attempts to bite the character to infect them with wererat lycanthropy.If you roll this encounter again, a di3erent beggar approaches the group for alms.

7PART ONE | RANDOM CITY ENCOUNTERSB KLinden T allowick. a half-elf apprentice wizard (see appendix 2), walks out in front of a horse while carrying a teetering pile of books. Linden is knocked prone with his books scattered around him, where he lies stunned but unharmed. A callous soul could steal his history books and sell them as a lot for 20 gp.If helped, Linden introduces the characters to his mistress Vajra Safahr, the Blacksta3, who is always looking to hire adventurers (for more details on these the Blacksta3, see appendix B of Waterdeep: Dragon Heist). If you repeat this encounter, the characters meet T allowick again, this time without his pile of books.B T)The Font of Knowledge in the Castle Ward is Waterdeep’s largest public library. The faithful of Oghma keep a watchful eye over the shelves, but thefts still occur. While the characters are passing through the ward, they encounter one of these thieves fresh from the job. Roll a d4 to determine who they meet:1. A penniless acolyte of Chauntea has stolen a series of self-help romance books to woo a noble’s daughter. When the tomes tumble from under his robes, the poor wretch breaks down and confesses his sins to the characters.2. An unschooled kenku o3ers to pay the characters 5 gp if they read aloud from her stolen book on powered ﬂight. If they do so, she becomes obsessed with piloting a hang-glider and beseeches the characters to help her build it.3. An apprentice wizard (see appendix 2) tears o3 and devours the pages of a library book as ﬁve acolytes of Oghma chase him down the street. The mad apprentice believes that he must consume knowledge to truly understand it.4. A halﬂing bandit tries to hawk the “Spellbook of Halaster Blackcloak” for 50 gp. The book is nothing of the sort but is clearly marked property of the Font of Knowledge and contains a heretical theory about the origins of wild magic.B(.' RKelia Wintersbane, a sun elf spy and reporter for The T arge broadsheet, begins shadowing the characters. The T arge is prone to vitriolic pieces on all manner of local topics, and Kelia’s looking to do a hit piece on the “scourge of adventurers” in the city. If the characters confront Kelia, she frames her article as a human-interest story and asks if she can interview and observe the characters for a few days. In her notes, she spins events to make the characters appear in the worst light possible.  If you roll this encounter again, a reporter from a rival newspaper tries the same deal, perhaps with honest intentions this time.C&() HThe champion of a ward competition is carried on the shoulders of a crowd to the House of Heroes in the Sea Ward. Characters who show interest learn the date of the next ward competition and are told how to register for the event. See the “Festival Parade” and “Street Race” encounters for details on example competitions.C(& PA homeowner empties a chamber pot of “night soil” from a second story window. Each character must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or be spattered by the sloppy contents. Roll a d4 to determine who emptied the pot:1. A maid in the service of a wealthy lawyer. Her master is abusive, and "bombing" pedestrians is one of her few little pleasures.2. A spy belonging to the Xanathar Guild. If the adventurers protest his behavior, he smirks and says, "You have no idea who you’re dealing with."3. An absent-minded toymaker who is oblivious to what she has done. She apologizes if the characters confront her and o3ers them a clever clockwork toy as compensation.4. A kenku member of the Red Sashes. If the adventurers complain, he o3ers to have the “bird droppings” cleaned from their clothes and attempts to recruit them to the Red Sashes.C) W(A City Watch patrol marches down the street. The patrol comprises ﬁve City Watch guards and one veteran o4cer. If the characters have committed a crime, they must succeed on an opposed group Charisma (Deception) check versus the veteran’s passive Insight of 10 to avoid attracting attention. Even if the characters have abided by the law, there’s a 1-in-4 chance that the o4cers stop them for questioning.C('. C()(A carriage has crashed on the street ahead. Roll a d3 to determine what's happened:1. A pair of local guides overloaded their carriage by cramming in a trio of visiting authors. The axle broke, and now the guides must stay with the carriage while it undergoes repairs. They o3er the group 25gp to escort the authors at speed to a local breakfast bar and show them a good time before their seminar.2. Gangsters from the Xanathar Guild rammed the carriage to rob the two nobles held within. T wo guards defend the noble's carriage against 1d6 hobgoblins and a hobgoblin sergeant loyal to the Xanathar Guild.3. After crashing her carriage, the goblin driver ﬂed the scene on foot. If caught, she reveals that she's a getaway driver for the Xanathar Guild. She's too scared to tell her boss about the crash but provides directions to his hideout if the characters o3er to negotiate on her behalf (for more details on the Xanatahar, see chapter 5, “Spring Madness,” of Waterdeep: Dragon Heist).C)''Passing through the City of the Dead, the characters hear chanting nearby. On closer inspection, they discover a group of six cultists in the throes of a religious rite.  The remains of a cat lay spread out before them on an overturned headstone.If confronted, the cultists ﬂee in di3erent directions. Any captured cultists shriek in pain as they bite out their own tongues to avoid betraying their faith. If you roll this encounter a second time, more cultists have returned with their cult fanatic leader to ﬁnish the ceremony.

T o determine who the cultists worship, roll a d4.1. Loviatar, Goddess of Pain2. Bhaal, God of Murder.3. Malar, God of the Hunt.4. T alona, Goddess of Disease and PoisonD W')'The characters hear a scream from a nearby alley. Arronal, a warlock of the ﬁend (see appendix 2) and a cloaked babau (see appendix 2) have abducted a young man named Bol o3 the street with the intent of o3ering him in sacriﬁce to Baphomet. They’ve set up a demonic altar in a nearby building using ﬁve golden candle sticks worth 10 gp each. If the sacriﬁce goes ahead, 2d6 maw demons (see appendix 2) spew forth from a rift to the Abyss and rampage through the Ward.If this encounter is rerolled, the characters encounter Bol again, but now he’s gone insane and become a cult fanatic of Baphomet himself. Bol is abducting someone else to complete the demonic ritual.D T&('The characters cross paths with two thoroughly inebriated members of the Black Boar T ribe (two berserkers). One of them bumps into randomly-determined character and naturally takes o3ense. The o3ending character must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check or be sucker-punched by the berserker. If the character o3ers to make it up with a drink, the check is made with advantage. If you roll this encounter again, use the “Random Factions” table to determine the troublemakers’ allegiances.E'. C).A child of roughly ten years dashes into the midst of the characters, twitching and gibbering strangely. His parents follow close behind, shouting for help. Young Benji T ormson is a vessel for a primal spirit, which possesses him whenever he panics. If Benji succumbs to the spirit, he begins to radiate magic randomly (use the evoker stats from appendix 2). A DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check calms the child, dampening the spirit’s inﬂuence. If the characters assault or kill Benji, they must answer to the parents and the authorities.A remove curse spell can drive out the spirit, but Benji’s parents can’t a3ord to pay for the ceremony. Character who cast the spell themselves or pay 300 gp to have it cast at a temple earn the family’s eternal thanks. If you roll this encounter more than once, the characters cross paths with Benji and his parents yet again.F( M PA character spots a money pouch lying in the gutter. Roll 1d6 to ﬁnd out what’s inside:1. 1d6 gp and a note that reads "Now we’re even."2. A very angry poisonous snake.3. Fresh horse dung.4. A cloud of foul-smelling smoke billows from within and everyone within 5 feet of the bag reeks of rotten eggs until they next wash their clothes. Gnome mage Igglewen Cogsworthy watches from a nearby doorway and rolls over with uproarious laughter if her prank succeeds. If the characters take the joke well, she clips a clothespin to her nose and o3ers to buy them a round of drinks.5. The pouch is ﬁlled with small pebbles. When a character reaches for it, a human assassin named Black Pidden attempts to stab them in the back as he walks by. He doesn’t ﬁght to the death, and if questioned reveals that he was hired by one of the group’s enemies.6. The pouch contains a fake map to the legendary Vault of Dragons. Characters who follow the trail are lured into a nearby tavern as a publicity stunt.F')( P((.The characters encounter a raucous festival parade that slows progress through the streets to a crawl. Roll a d3 to determine what’s happening:1. T wo wards compete to hurl a solid silver ball into a goal in their rival’s ward. This violent game has just one rule: you can’t move while carrying the ball. If the players join in, the ﬁrst character in the group to succeed on four consecutive DC 15 Strength (Athletics) checks makes the winning throw. Failure on any of these checks results in the character taking 2 (1d4) bludgeoning damage from the ﬂailing limbs of stampeding competitors.2. A street food stall goes up in ﬂames, catching the painted sails of a passing festival ﬂoat. The ﬂames roar up the ﬂoat, threatening to devour the performers dancing on its roof.3. Elaborately-costumed dancers try to cajole the group into joining their performance. If a character joins in and succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma (Performance) check, they catch the attention of a passing talent scout and are invited to visit the Sea Maiden’s Faire for an audition with Zardoz Zord (see chapter 7, “Maestro’s Fall,” of Waterdeep: Dragon Heist).

F) C'A ﬂeeing cutpurse (a spy) slips a stolen gem worth 50 gp into a character’s pocket. Any character in the group with a passive Perception score of 11 or higher sees the thief plant the gem.A few moments after the gem is planted, a patrol of four City Watch guards arrives on the scene. If the character has the gem in hand, the guards spot it and approach with cudgels bared! Convincing the guards of the character’s innocence requires surrendering the gem and a successful DC 13 Charisma (Deception or Persuasion) check. Otherwise, the character must surrender the gem and pay a ﬁne of 50 gp to avoid hard punishment.If you roll this encounter again, the characters spot a di3erent cutpurse dashing through the crowds, and no gem is planted.F(A funeral is taking place here. Roll a d3 to determine what’s happening:1. The funeral is for a City Watch o4cer who was killed while trying to arrest a drunken adventurer. 3d6 commoners, 3d6 guards, 1d6 veterans and one priest are in attendance. Anyone who looks like an adventurer is met with scorn and disgust.2. A group of gangsters pose as a funeral party to exhume the grave of former comrade for the treasure map and 100gp ring she was buried with. A master thief watches while 1d6 thugs dig.3. An adventuring company called the Sons of the North commemorate their fallen comrade with a few bottles of wine. The remaining members of the group comprise: Sir Humphren Boldblade (human knight), Silandra (sun elf mage), T ala Furryfoot (lightfoot halﬂing priest of Cyrrollalee), and Ruc Brokentusk (half-orc berserker). Ruc is particularly grief-stricken and is looking for a ﬁght. His friends try to stop him from coming to blows with the characters but come to his aid if combat ensues.G( W(Violence is imminent. T wo rival factions face o3 against each other in the street, or one group prepares to ambush the other. Either way, things are about to get bloody!Roll twice on the Random Factions table to determine who's involved (reroll if the pairing seems unlikely). Most groups consist of 2d4 members: either acolytes, apprentice wizards (see appendix 2), bandits, bandit captains, cultists, cult fanatics, druids, goblins, guards, kobolds, nobles, priests, scouts, spies, thugs, or wererats as appropriate.G'Rumors abound of the spirit of a young child wandering the City of the Dead. As the characters move through the cemetery, they encounter this spirit manifesting as a ghost. Speaking an archaic form of Chondathan, the child is oblivious of being dead and the circumstances surrounding their death. The child cries for their mother "Sha5ii." The spirit is unable to leave the graveyard and disappears an hour after appearing. No amount of searching o4cial records ﬁnds the name anywhere.If you reroll this encounter, the characters encounter the same spirit again.

The Dungsweepers Guild has gotten tired of a nearby shop shirking its monthly payments and has decided to teach them a lesson by sabotaging a ﬁsh wagon just outside the premises. Four guild thugs are now hurling shovel-fulls of smelly ﬁsh at the shop's windows. They ﬁght anyone who tries to stop them but ﬂee if the characters reduce two or more of them to 0 hit points.3. Four thugs from a small-time gang suspect that the wagon is hauling illicit goods belonging to a rival organization.

The cause of death is indiscernible, but each child has a strange symbol branded on their back: three inverted triangles arranged to resemble a larger triangle. A successful DC 17 Intelligence (Religion) check identiﬁes this as the infernal symbol of Asmodeus.2. A black stone sarcophagus that contains skeletal remains swilling in a pool of stinking red ﬂuid. A tin tiara rests on the skeleton’s brow, inscribed with a rune that a successful DC 13 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals to mean "patience." If the tiara is removed, a wraith coalesces from the sludge and attacks whomever holds the tiara.3. A heavy stone slab covers the entrance to a hitherto unknown crypt. Inside the crypt, a glass co4n contains the perfectly preserved body of a beautiful Chultan woman in her late-40s. There are no indications or clues as to the body's identity, and the crypt isn't identiﬁed on any o4cial records.4. The characters unearth a featureless black stone orb from the oozing muck. Divination magic yields no clues about it, but any creature that carries the orb in their possession for more than a tenday is haunted by dreams of drowning in stinking, black slime.

Often the sewers get clogged and spill out onto the streets from ruptured pipes or manholes.Roll a d4 to determine what - or who - emerges from the dark. Any creature taking damage during this encounter risks being infected by Darkrot, a disease native to the Waterdeep sewers (see the “Darkrot” sidebar).1.

A horde of 2d10 zombies shambles from a breach in the sewer tunnels.DarkrotDarkrot is a disease that incubates in the sewers of Waterdeep and the refuse heaps of Rat Hill. Its effects are transmitted by exposure to sewer waste or to the creatures that dwell within, such as rats and otyughs.When a humanoid creature is bitten by a creature infected with Darkrot or spends a minute in contact with filth or offal contaminated by the disease, the creature must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become infected.If contaminated waste is disturbed by digging, explosive spellcasting, fire, or combat, each creature within 30 feet must make an immediate saving throw to avoid infection.It takes 1d3 days for Darkrot’s symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include labored breathing with a hissing rasp and large black blotches on the skin. An infected creature suffers one level of exhaustion and regains only half the normal number of hit points from spending Hit Dice. Infected creatures don’t regain any hit points from finishing a long rest.At the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature gains one level of exhaustion. On a successful save, its exhaustion level decreases by one level. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected creature’s level of exhaustion to zero, the creature recovers from the disease.S) C)Under Waterdeep’s tough maritime laws, it’s a crime for a sailor to abscond from service if they’ve already signed a ship’s contract.

A friendly veteran o3ers to buy the characters a drink if they join him a local tavern. He laces their drinks with torpor (see “Poisons” in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide,) and forces any character who succumbs to the e3ect to sign a ship’s contract.2. The characters witness a pair of thugs bullying a drunken sailor into signing their contract.3. A spy for a local merchant pushes a blackmail note into a character’s hand, which promises to “unleash violence on your family like the untamed hounds of hell” unless the character signs a ship’s contract.

Waterdeep ain’t had trouble with bloodsuckers for centuries! 2You know there are treasure maps everywhere nowadays? Can’t say what it’s all about, but if you ask me, someone’s trying to distract folks from noticing something. 3Volo is back in town! Working on a new book about taverns I hear. Last I saw him, he was drinking his way through the Dock Ward sampling the local brews. 4Word on the streets says that someone’s been stockpiling smokepowder. There’s no good reason for that. 5Justyn from the Guild of Butchers grew up in Field Ward and has dreams of a fancy home. If you want to make a friend of him, pass him a few extra coins.  6They say that Trollskull Manor, that old tavern off Trollskull Alley, is haunted by the ghost of the half-elf bartender Lif, who literally worked himself to death. I’d stay away if I were you. 7There’s been a lot more drow in the city of late. It’s good to see the dark elves overcoming their evil history and becoming contributing citizens. Anyone can make a new life in the City of Splendors!8Last night I heard a strange clanking inside the House of the Inspired Hands in the Sea Ward. It was like someone wearing plate armor dancing a jig. 9Are you in great need? Local thugs threatening your family? If you need help, and if you can find him, you might be able to convince the monk Hlam to aid you. They say he’s the Grandmaster of the Order of the Even-Handed, a group devoted to the returned god Tyr. He’s been known to aid those in great peril. 10Lots of the Black Network in town. I hear there’s a split between the Zhents who follow Pereghost and some new upstart claiming to be Manshoon. Not possible of course, since Manshoon is dead. Again.11The ghost of the Black Viper is back from the dead! A century ago that burglar and assassin plagued this city, and now they’ve returned with flair!  12I hear that one of the Masked Lords is a vampire! Do you think it could be true? If it were, who knows what tax they might demand.13Looking for potions, poultices, or philters? Try Fala Lefaliir who operates an herbalist’s shop on Trollskull Alley called Corellon’s Crown.14Most of the City Watch is corrupt. They don’t care about the people, only lining their pockets. They’ll hassle you for no good reason, but at least you can bribe your way out of most problems with a few Dragons. 15There’s a sea monster haunting Deepwater Harbor! Fishermen coming in late have spotted a huge shiny creature with massive claws and evil glowing eyes swimming through the harbor and out to sea. I’d steer clear of the water if I were you. 16Something’s not right with that halfling hostel on Spices Street. Its well-kept, but the place is overrun by rats. They’ve got to be getting in through a tunnel from the sewers. 17One of the Guilds has been infiltrated by dopplegangers, but no one knows which one. I’m betting on the Fellowship of Innkeepers. It just makes sense: lots of gossip and spying opportunities, and if someone goes missing, no one will notice. 18The Blackstaff has gone wonky and you can’t trust her. Rumors say she’s started hunting down members of her own Force Grey. Think twice if she offers you a job. 19You noticed the odd weather of late? I bet it’s a sign. I was talking to my greengrocer yesterday and he told me that he heard from the fishmonger that the Sea Ward is rife with devil worshippers!20A light has been seen in Ahghairon’s Tower the last three nights. It’s been magically sealed for centuries, and not even the Blackstaff has ever gained entry. No one could have gotten inside, could they?

Each night, the stone radiates powerful necromantic magic that a3ects the City of the Dead (see the “Unearthed Evil” encounters in “Random City Encounters.”)As the characters pass by the shrine, they witness a young acolyte of Jergal named Ophemar Reil banging on the doors and calling out Victus’s name.

If the characters question Ophemar, they learn of Victus’s odd behavior in recent days.If confronted, Victus is unwilling to part with the tablet and lashes out violently if the characters use force to retrieve it.
