INTRODUCTION 
ELCOME TO TALES FROM THE YAWNING PORTAL. 
Within this book you will find seven of the 
deadliest dungeons from the history of D&D, 
updated for the current edition of the game. 
Some are classics that have hosted an untold 
number of adventurers, while others are 
newer creations boldly staking their place in 
the pantheon of notable D&D adventures. 
Just as these dungeons have made an impression on 
D&D players, so too have tales of their dangers spread 
across the D&D multiverse. When the night grows long 
in Waterdeep, City of Splendors, and the fireplace in the 
taproom of the Yawning Portal dims to a deep crimson, 
adventurers from across the Sword Coast-and even 
some visiting from other D&D worlds-spin tales and 
rumors of lost treasures. 
A wanderer from the distant Shou Empire speaks of 
strange, leering devil faces carved in dungeon walls 
that can devour an explorer in an instant, leaving be­
hind not a single trace of the poor soul's passing. 
A bald, stern wizard clad in blue robes and speaking 
with a strange accent tells of a wizard who claimed 
three powerful weapons from a city on the shores of 
a lake of unknown depths, who spirited them away to 
a slumbering volcano and dared adventurers to enter 
his lair and recover them. 
• A one-eyed dwarf spins tales of a castle that fell into 
the earth, and whose ruins stand above a subterra­
nean grove dominated by a tree that spawns evil. 
These are only a few of the tales that have spread across 
the Sword Coast from the furthest reaches of Faerun 
and beyond. The minor details change with the telling. 
The dread tomb of Acererak shifts its location from a 
dismal swamp, to a searing desert, to some other for­
bidding clime in each telling. The key elements remain 
the same in each version of the tales, lending a thread of 
truth to the tale. 
The seeds of those stories now rest in your hand. 
D&D's deadliest dungeons are now part of your arsenal 
of adventures. Enjoy, and remember to keep a few spare 
character sheets handy. 
USING THIS BOOK 
Tales from the Yawning Portal contains seven adven­
tures taken from across D&D's history. 
The introduction of each adventure provides ideas 
on adapting it to a variety of D&D settings. Use that in­
formation to place it in your campaign or to give you an 
idea of how to adapt it. 
These adventures provide the perfect side quest away 
from your current campaign. If you run published D&D 
campaigns, such as Storm King's Thunder, the higher 
level adventures presented here are an ideal way to ex­
tend the campaign beyond. 
INTRODUCTION ABOUT THE ADVENTURES 
THE SUNLESS CITADEL 
The Sunless Citadel, written by Bruce R. Cordell, was 
the first published adventure for the third edition of the 
D&D game. It is designed for a party of four or five 1st­
level player characters. 
Ever since its publication in 2000, The Sunless Cit­
adel has been widely regarded as an excellent way to 
introduce new players to the game. It's also a great start­
ing experience for someone looking to be a Dungeon 
Master for the first time. 
THE FORGE OF FURY 
The Forge of Fury, written by Richard Baker, was pub­
lished in 2000 shortly after The Sunless Citadel. Char­
acters who succeeded in that mission and advanced to 
3rd level were now ready to take on the challenges of a 
ruined dwarven fortress. 
Like its predecessor, The Forge of Fury is tailored to 
provide increasingly tougher threats as the characters 
make their way through the fortress. Those who survive 
the experience can expect to advance to 5th level­
seasoned adventurers ready to strive for greater glory 
and renown. 
THE HIDDEN SHRINE OF TAMOACHAN 
The Hidden Shrine ofTamoachan, written by Harold 
Johnson and Jeff R. Leason, made its debut under the 
title Lost Tamoachan at the Origins game convention in 
1979, where it was used in the official D&D competition. 
The first published version of the adventure was pro­
duced in 1980. 
The updated version of the adventure presented 
herein is designed for a group of four or five 5th-level 
player characters. 
WHITE PLUME MOUNTAIN 
Lawrence Schick, the author of White Plume Mountain, 
related in the 2013 compilation Dungeons of Dread that 
he wrote the adventure as a way of persuading Gary 
Gygax to hire him as a game designer. Not only did he 
get the job, but White Plume became an instant favorite 
when it was first published in 1979. 
The version of the adventure in this book is tailored to 
a group of characters of 8th level. 
DEAD IN THAY 
Dead in Thay, written by Scott Fitzgerald Gray, was cre­
ated when the fifth edition D&D game was in the testing 
stages. In its original form, it was used as the story of 
the D&D Encounters season in the spring of 2014. Fea­
turing an immense and lethal dungeon known as the 
Doomvault, the adventure serves as a tribute to Tomb of 
Horrors, Ruins of Undermountain, and other "killer dun­
geons" throughout the history of the game. 
The version of Dead in Thay presented here is modi­
fied for use in home campaigns. It is designed for char­
acters of 9th to 11th level. 

--- PAGE 6 ---

AGAINST THE GIANTS 
The three linked adventures that make up Against the 
Giants were created and originally released in 197 . 
during the time when Gary Gygax was still writing the 
Player's Handbook for the original AD&D game. Despite 
being (in a sense) older than the game itself, these ad­
ventures continue to hold a special place in the hearts 
and memories of D&D players of all ages. 
The compilation of Steading of the Hill Giant Chief, 
Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant]arl, and Hall of the Fire 
Giant King was published in 1981 as Against the Giants. 
The version presented here is designed to be under­
taken by characters of 11th level. 
TOMB OF HORRORS 
Before there was much of anything else in the world of 
the D&D game, there was the Tomb of Horrors. 
The first version of the adventure was crafted for Gary 
Gygax's personal campaign in the early 1970s and went 
on to be featured as the official DUNGEONS & DRAGONS 
event at the original Origins gaming convention in 1975. 
The first publication of Tomb of Horrors, as a part of the 
Advanced D&D game, came in 1978. 
As a proving ground for characters and players alike, 
fabricated by the devious mind of the game's cocreator, 
Tomb of Horrors has no equal in the annals of D&D's 
greatest adventures. Only high-level characters stand 
a chance of coming back alive, but every player who 
braves the Tomb will have the experience of a lifetime. 
RUNNING THE ADVENTURES 
To run each of these adventures, you need the fifth edi­
tion Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide, and 
Monster Manual. Before you sit down with your players, 
read the text of the adventure all the way through and 
familiarize yourself with the maps as well, perhaps 
making notes about complex areas or places where the 
characters are certain to go, so you're well prepared be­
fore the action starts. 
l Text that appears in a box like this is meant to be read 
aloud or paraphrased for the players when their charac­
ters first arrive at a location or under a specific circum­
stance, as described in the text. 
The Monster Manual contains stat blocks for most 
of the monsters and NPCs found in this book. When a 
monster's name appears in bold type, that's a visual cue 
pointing you to the creature's stat block in the Monster 
Manual. Descriptions and stat blocks for new monsters 
appear in appendix B. If a stat block is in that appendix, 
an adventure's text tells you so. 
Spells and nonmagical objects or equipment men­
tioned in the book are described in the Player's Hand­
book. Magic items are described in the Dungeon Mas­
ter's Guide, unless the adventure 's text directs you to an 
item's description in appendix A. CREATING A CAMPAIGN 
While these adventures were never meant to be com­
bined into a full campaign -over 30 years separates 
the newest from the oldest-they have been selected 
to provide play across a broad range of levels. With a 
little work, you can run a complete campaign using only 
this book. 
Starting with The Sunless Citadel, guide your players 
through the adventures in the order that they are pre­
sented in this book. Each one provides enough XP that, 
upon completing the adventure , the characters should 
be high enough level to advance to the next one. 
The Yawning Portal, or some other tavern of your own 
invention or drawn from another D&D setting, provides 
the perfect framing device for the campaign . The char­
acters hear rumors of each dungeon, with just enough 
information available to lead them to the next adventure . 
Perhaps a friendly NPC drawn from the upcoming 
adventure visits the tavern in search of help, or some 
element of a character 's background pushes the group 
down the proper road. In any case, these dungeons are 
designed to be easily portable to any campaign setting. 
THE YAWNING PORTAL 
Amid the bustle ofWaterdeep , within the Castle Ward 
where barristers, nobles, and emissaries battle with 
word and contract, stands an inn not quite like any 
other. Before there was a Castle Ward or even what 
could be recognized as an ancestor of the City of Splen­
dors, there was a dungeon , and in that dungeon begins 
the tale of the Yawning Portal. 
In ages past, the mighty wizard Halaster built his 
tower at the foot of Mount Waterdeep and delved deep 
into tunnels first built by dwarves and drow in search 
of ever greater magical power. Halaster and his appren­
tices expanded the tunnels they found, worming out new 
lairs under the surface for reasons of their own. In time, 
their excavations grew into the vast labyrinth known 
today as Undermountain , the largest dungeon in all of 
the Forgotten Realms. Halaster eventually disappeared, 
as have all his apprentices , but the massive complex he 
built remains to this day. 
For untold years, the secrets of Undermountain re­
mained hidden from the surface world. Everyone who 
entered its halls failed to return. Its reputation as a 
death trap grew to the point that criminals in Waterdeep 
THE GREEN DRAGON INN 
The Yawning Portal is not the only renowned tavern in 
D&D lore. In the Free City of Greyhawk stands the Green 
Dragon Inn, which has been the starting point for some of 
the most successful expeditions to Castle Greyhawk and 
beyond. The place is crowded and smoke-filled. Patrons 
talk in low voices, and anyone attempting to strike up a 
conversation without making a clear intent to pay can ex­
pect a cold reception. Paranoia and suspicion run rampant 
here, as befits a free city that stands at the nexus between 
a devil-haunted empire, a vast domain locked in the iron­
tight grip of a demigod of evil, and a splintered, bickering 
host of kingdoms nominally committed to justice and 
weal. In the battered, weary world ofGreyhawk , profit and 
power take precedence over heroics. 
INTRODUCTION 5 

--- PAGE 7 ---

6 who were sentenced to die were forcibly escorted into 
the dungeon and left to fend for themselves. 
All of that changed with the arrival of two men, a 
warrior named Durnan and a ne'er-do-well named Mirt. 
The duo were the first adventurers to return from Un­
dermountain, laden with riches and magic treasures. 
While Mirt used his wealth to buy a mansion, Durnan 
had different plans. Durnan retired from adventuring 
and purchased the land on which sat the deep, broad 
well that was the only known entrance to the dungeon. 
Around this well he built a tavern and inn that caters to 
adventurers and those who seek their services, and he 
called it the Yawning Portal. 
Some of the magic Durnan looted on his successful 
foray into Undermountain granted him a life span that 
exceeds even that of an elf. And for decades Durnan left 
delving into Undermountain to younger folk. Yet one 
day, something drew him back. Days of waiting for his 
triumphant return from the dungeon turned to months 
and then years. For nearly a century, citizens ofWater­
deep thought him dead. But one night, a voice called up 
from the well. Few at first believed it could be Durnan, 
but folk as long-lived as he vouched it so. The Yawning 
Portal had passed into the hands of his ancestors, but 
Durnan returned with enough riches for them to quietly 
retire. Durnan took his customary place behind the bar, 
raised a toast to his own safe return, and then began 
serving customers as if he'd never left. 
Adventurers from across Faerun, and even from else­
where in the great span of the multiverse, visit the Yawn­
ing Portal to exchange knowledge about Undermountain 
and other dungeons. Most visitors are content to swap 
stories by the hearth, but sometimes a group driven by 
greed, ambition, or desperation pays the toll for entry 
and descends the well. Most don't survive to make the 
return trip, but enough come back with riches and tales 
of adventure to tempt other groups into trying their luck. 
FEATURES OF THE YAWNING PORTAL 
The Yawning Portal's taproom fills the first floor of the 
building. The 40-foot-diameter well that provides access 
to Undermountain dominates the space. The "well" is all 
that remains of Halaster's tower, and now, devoid of the 
stairways and floors that formed subterranean levels, it 
drops as an open shaft for 140 feet. Stirges, spiders, and 
worse have been known to invade the Yawning Portal 
from below. 
Balconies on the tavern's second and third floors 
overlook the well, with those floors accessed by way of 
wooden stairs that rise up from the taproom. Guests sit­
ting at the tables on the balconies have an excellent view 
of the well and the action below. 
Entering the Well. Those who wish to enter Under­
mountain for adventure (or the daring tourists who 
just want to "ride the rope") must pay a gold piece to be 
lowered down. The return trip also costs a piece of gold, 
sent up in a bucket in advance. Once the initial payment 
is made, a few stairs takes one to the top of the waist­
high lip of the well. The rope that hangs in the center 
of the well is levered over to the lip by a beam in the 
rafters, and when those who have paid are ready, they 
mount the rope and take the long ride down. 
INTRODUCTION Oddities on Display. A staggering variety of curios 
and oddities adorn the taproom. Traditionally, adven­
turers who recover a strange relic from Undermountain 
present it to Durnan as a trophy of their success. Other 
adventurers leave such curio to mark their visits to 
the tavern, or relinquish them after losing a bet with 
Durnan, who likes to wager on the fate of adventuring 
bands that enter the dungeon. Occasiona lly, something 
that strikes Durnan's fancy can be used to pay a bar tab.

A TYPICAL EVENING 
On quiet nights, guests in the Yawning Portal gather 
around a large fireplace in the taproom and swap tales 
of distant places, strange monsters, and valuable trea­
sures. On busier nights, the place is loud and crowded. 
The balconies overflow with merchants and nobles, 
while the tables on the ground floor are filled with 
adventurers and their associates. Invariably, the combi­
nation of a few drinks and the crowd's encouragement 
induces some folk to pay for a brief trip down into Un­
dermountain. Most folk pay in advance for a ride down 
and immediately back up, though a few ambitious souls 
might launch impromptu expeditions into the dungeon. 
Few such ill-prepared parties ever return. 
Groups seeking to enter Undermountain for a specific 
reason generally come to the tavern during its quiet 
hours. Even at such times, there are still a few prying 
eyes in the taproom, lurkers who carry news of the com­
ings and goings from Undermountain to the Zhentarim. 
dark cults, criminal gangs, and other interested parties.

DURNAN 
The proprietor of the Yawning Portal is something of an 
enigma. Blessed with a seemingly limitless life span by 
rreasures he brought back from his expedition nearly 
vo centuries ago, he is as much a fixture in the tap­
room as the well. 
Durnan is a man of few words. He expects to be paid 
for his time, and will offer insight and rumors only in 
return for hard cash. "We know the odds and take our 
chances," he says, whether he is breaking up a card 
game that has turned violent or refusing the pleas of ad­
venturers trapped at the bottom of the well who are un­
able to pay for a ride up. Despite his stony heart, he is an 
excellent source of information about Undermountain 
and other dungeons , provided one can pay his price. 
Personality Trait: Isolation. It's a cruel world. All 
people have to fend for themselves. Self-sufficiency is 
the only path to success. 
Ideal: Independence. Someone who can stand alone 
can stand against anything. 
Bond: The Yawning Portal. This place is my only 
home. My friends and family are long gone. I love this 
place, but I try not to get attached to the people here. I'll 
outlive them all. Lucky me. 
Flaw: Heartless. If you want sympathy, the Temple of 
Ilmater is in the Sea Ward. No matter how bad things 
are, you'll be gone in a blink of an eye. OTHER DENIZENS 
The Yawning Portal is host to a variety of regular visi­
tors, most of whom offer services to adventurers. Chap­
ter 4 of the Dungeon Master's Guide provides plenty 
of resources for generating nonplayer characters. The 
following table provides some possibilities for why an 
individual is visiting the Yawning Portal.

THE SUNLESS CITADEL 
All things roll here: horrors of midnights, 
Campaigns of a lost year, 
Dungeons disturbed, and groves of lights; 
Echoing on these shores, still clear, 
Dead ecstasies of questing knights-
Yet how the wind revives us here! 
-Arthur Rimbaud 
HIS ADVENTURE CONCERNS A ONCE-PROUD 
fortress that fell into the earth in an age 
long past. Now known as the Sunless Cita­
del, its echoing, broken halls house malign 
creatures. Evil has taken root at the cita­
del's core, which is deep within a subter­
ranean garden of blighted foliage. Here a 
terrible tree and its dark shepherd plot in darkness. 
The tree, called the Gulthias Tree, is shepherded by 
a twisted druid, Belak the Outcast. He was drawn to 
the buried citadel twelve years ago, following stories of 
oddly enchanted fruit to their source. The druid found 
an old fortress that had been swallowed up by the 
earth in some sort of magically invoked devastation . 
With the previous inhabitants long dispersed, vile and 
opportunistic creatures common to lightless dungeons 
infested the subterranean ruins. At the core of the old 
fortress, Belak stumbled upon the Twilight Grove. He 
discovered at the grove's heart the Gulthias Tree, which 
sprouted from a wooden stake that was used to slay an 
ancient vampire. 
A perfect, ruby-red apple ripens on the Gulthias Tree 
at the summer solstice, and the tree produces a single 
albino apple at the winter solstice. The midsummer fruit 
grants vigor, health, and life, while the midwinter fruit 
steals the same. In the years since Belak's arrival, the 
enchanted fruit has been widely dispersed through the 
surrounding lands, promoting good and ill. The seeds 
of either fruit, if allowed to sprout, grow into small plant 
monsters known as twig blights. 
ADVENTURE SYNOPSIS 
During their trip through the Sunless Citadel, charac­
ters deal with monstrous threats and ancient traps, as 
well as warring tribes of kobolds and goblins. The ad­
venture is designed for four 1st-level player characters. 
They should advance through 2nd level to 3rd level be­
fore the finale. The adventure has four basic parts: 
1. Oakhurst. Although it isn't part of the adventure per 
se, the village of Oakhurst can provide the characters 
with valuable information about the citadel. They can 
also use Oakhurst as a place to recuperate and replen­
ish supplies. 2. Kobold Den. The characters' foray into the citadel be­
gins with an incursion into the most accessible areas 
of the fortress, where a tribe of kobolds has taken up 
residence. The characters can avoid strife with the ko­
bolds by agreeing to retrieve a lost pet for the kobold 
leader, and they might be able to persuade the kobolds 
to join their side. 
3. Goblin Lair. The goblins that live deeper inside the 
citadel consider themselves the owners of the place. 
They defend themselves aggressively against intru­
sion, making it difficult to avoid combat with them. 
4. Hidden Grove. Eventually, the characters discover 
the lower level of the citadel and the Twilight Grove 
that lies within. There, they learn the truth about the 
enchanted fruit, and they must confront Belak the Out­
cast and the Gulthias Tree. 
RUNNING THE ADVENTURE 
To enhance the experience of the players and help you 
do your best job as Dungeon Master, take the following 
pieces of advice and information into consideration. 
MAPPING 
It can be difficult to keep track of all the corridors, turns, 
areas, and other features of a dungeon setting, and the 
player characters could soon get turned around without 
a map. Ask for a volunteer to be the party mapper. It's 
the mapper's job to listen carefully to your description 
of each area, noting its size and exits, and to record that 
information by sketching on a sheet of paper. 
PLACING THE ADVENTURE 
The Sunless Citadel is designed to be easily located in what­
ever setting the DM prefers. Here are some examples . 
Dragonlan ce. On Krynn, the citadel was once part ofXak 
Tsaroth, and it harbored worshipers ofTakhisis. When that 
city was destroyed during the cataclysm, it fell into a rift 
that opened in the earth. In this setting, consider replacing 
the kobolds in the adventure with gully dwarves. 
Eberron. Located near the western edge of the Mourn­
land, the citadel was an ancient ruin even during the time 
of the Last War. Agents of Cyre used it as a way point for 
conducting espionage against neighboring realms. On the 
Day of Mourning, the earth opened up and swallowed the 
place. The Mournland is within sight of the rift. 
Forgotten Realms. On Faerun, the Sunless Citadel was 
once a secret stronghold of the Cult of the Dragon, located 
in the foothills northwest ofThundertree. It plunged into 
the earth when Mount Hotenow erupted and threw Never­
winter into chaos. 
Creyhawk. The Sunless Citadel is a ruined Baklunish 
stronghold that was cast into the bowels of the earth when 
the Suel lmperium unleashed the Invoked Devastation. 
It is located in northwestern Bissel, in the foothills west of 
Thornward.

10 TIME OF YEAR 
If you would like the characters to have the opportunity 
to find a fruit, begin the adventure a few weeks before ei­
ther the summer or winter solstice. Apart from making 
a piece of fruit available on the Gulthias Tree, choosing 
a season provides you with additional details to set the 
scene, which enhances the adventure . 
If you choose summer, the hills are lush with growth, 
though the heat sometimes grows oppressive . If the 
characters embark in the winter, temperatures hover 
just above freezing during the day and plunge below 
it at night. 
ADVENTURE HOOKS 
Adventurers can find the Sunless Citadel within a re­
mote and lonely ravine. The characters can be drawn 
to the dungeon for any of the following reasons. Relate 
the information below to the players as necessary to get 
them interested in journeying to the dungeon site. 
GOING FOR GLORY 
You are eager to make a name for yourself. The legend 
of the Sunless Citadel is well known locally, and stories 
indicate it is a place that holds promise for those intent 
on discovery , glory, and treasure! 
RESCUE MISSION 
Another party of adventurers, locally based, delved 
into the Sunless Citadel a month past. They were never 
seen again. Two human members of that ill-fated party 
were brother and sister, Talgen Hucrele (a fighter) and 
Sharwyn Hucrele (a wizard). They were part of an im­
portant merchant family based in the nearby village of 
Oakhurst. Kerowyn Hucrele, the matriarch of the family, 
offers salvage rights to you and your team if you can find 
and return with the two lost members of her family-or 
at least return the gold signet rings worn by the missing 
brother and sister. She also offers a reward of 125 gp 
per signet ring, per character . If the characters bring 
back the Hucreles in good shape (of good mind and 
body), she offers to double the reward. 
• 
ABOUT THE ORIGINAL SOLVING A MYSTERY 
The goblin tribe infesting the nearby ruins, called the 
Sunless Citadel, though no one knows why) sells a 
single piece of magical fruit to the highest bidder in 
Oakhurst once every midsummer. They've been doing 
this for the last twelve years. Usually, the fruit sells for 
around 50 gp, which is all the townsfolk can bring them­
selves to pay a goblin. The fruit, apparently an apple of 
perfect hue, heals those who suffer from any disease or 
other ailment. They sometimes plant the seeds at the 
center of each fruit, hoping to engender an enchanted 
apple tree. When the seeds germinate in their proper 
season, they produce a twiggy mass of twisted sapling 
stems. Not too long after the saplings reach 2 feet in 
height, they are stolen-every time. The townsfolk as­
sume the goblins send out thieves to ensure their mo­
nopoly of enchanted fruit. You are interested in piercing 
the mystery associated with how wretched goblins could 
ever possess such a wonder, and how they steal every 
sprouting sapling grown from the enchanted fruit's 
seed. Moreover, you wish to find this rumored tree of 
healing, hoping to heal an ailing friend or relative. 
0AKHURST 
The community closest to the Sunless Citadel is a vil­
lage called Oakhurst. Most of its 900 residents (includ­
ing outlying farms) are human, with a sizable minority 
of halflings and a scattering of other races. 
Significant locations in Oakhurst, and the people to be 
found within them, include the following: 
Village Hall. The center of government in Oakhurst 
includes the office of Mayor Vurnor Leng, a male 
human noble. 
General Store. The village's main source for supplies 
and merchandise is the general store, owned and op­
erated by Kerowyn Hucrele, a female human noble. 
Shrine. Advice, information, and healing are among 
the services dispensed at the village's shrine. It is 
maintained by Dem "Corkie" Nackle, a female gnome 
priest of Pelor. 
Jail. Next to the village hall is a stout building where 
miscreants serve their sentences. Oakhurst's con-
I The Sunless Citadel, by Bruce R. 
Cordell, was originally published in 
2000 as a beginning adventure for 
the third edition of the D&D game . The adventure is widely regarded as 
an excellent way to introduce play­
ers to D&D. It's also a great starting 
experience for a new DM.

stable is Felosial, a female half-elf veteran. She com­
mands a force of sixteen guards and four scouts who 
keep the village safe. 
Blacksmith. Repairing and forging arms and armor is 
the job of the village smithy, Rurik Lutgehr, a male 
dwarf commoner. 
01' Boar Inn. Garon, a male human commoner, is the 
owner and barkeep of the 01' Boar Inn. He serves food 
and drink, and the place has a few rooms that visi­
tors can rent. 
RUMORS HEARD IN OAKHURST 
Player characters can discover the following additional 
information while spending time in the local tavern, or 
through asking the right questions of the locals. 
• No one knows for sure what the Sunless Citadel once 
was, but legends hint that it served as the retreat of an 
ancient dragon cult. 
The Old Road skirts the Ashen Plain, a lifeless area. A 
character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (His­
tory) check knows that the desolation is attributed to 
the long-ago rampage of a dragon named Ashardalon. 
A few locals also know this fact. 
• Cattle herders don't graze their stock too far afield 
these days. They're frightened by stories of new 
monsters that maraud by night. From time to time, 
cattle and people who have gone out alone at night 
have been found dead the next day, bearing dozens of 
needle-like wounds. No one has seen the creatures 
that cause this mayhem, nor do they leave a discern­
ible trail. 
• The missing adventurers include a fighter (Talgen 
Hucrele), a wizard (Sharwyn Hucrele), a paladin of 
Pelor (Sir Braford), and a ranger (Karakas). Sir Bra­
ford was not a local, and he had a magic sword called 
Shatterspike. 
• Sometimes the goblins offer a different apple at mid­
winter. This apple is corpse-white and poisonous, even 
to the touch. No samples of either apple are to be had. 
SUNLESS CITADEL OVERVIEW 
A dragon cult that valued privacy and defense built the Sun­
less Citadel on the surface long ago. All record of the cult's 
name has vanished, though various sources believe that it was 
associated with the dragon Ashardalon. The cataclysm that 
killed the cult members sank the fortress at the same time. 
Because of residual enchantments, much of the structure sur­
vived its descent into the earth. With the cultists dead, goblins 
and other creatures moved in, and they have survived here for 
hundreds of years. 
The goblins, which belong to the Durbuluk tribe ("Domi­
nator" in Goblin). once patrolled the area around the ravine 
to rob passersby. But now, with the Old Road having fallen out 
of use, the goblins rarely pay much attention to this entrance 
anymore. Also, a tribe of kobolds has recently moved in to 
challenge the goblins' ownership of the fortress. Both groups 
are skirmishing as they vie for control, and they're not overly 
concerned about the possibility of intruders. Thus, the cleft 
offers the characters a good opportunity to gain entry to the 
dungeon without attracting attention. (The missing party that 
came here before did much the same; the rope left tied to the 
pillar near the ravine is theirs.) Garon, the barkeep of the 01' Boar Inn, remembers 
the last time anyone, aside from Talgen and Sharwyn, 
asked questions about the Sunless Citadel. About thir­
teen years ago, a grim human named Belak stopped 
by, and he had a very large pet frog. 
WILDERNESS ENCOUNTERS 
If the characters are anywhere between Oakhurst and 
the Sunless Citadel at night, four twig blights attack 
the party. The blights attack stealthily from out of 
nearby foliage. 
THE CITADEL 
See the old Dragon from his throne 
Sink with enormous ruin down! 
-Hymn 
Once the characters are ready to leave Oakhurst, the 
adventure truly begins. The overgrown Old Road winds 
through rocky downs, near stands of old-growth oak, 
and past abandoned farms. It is 7 miles from Oakhurst 
to the Sunless Citadel. 
RAVINE 
The Old Road passes to the east of a narrow ravine. At 
the road's closest approach to the cleft, several broken 
pillars jut from the earth where the ravine widens. Two 
of the pillars stand straight, but most lean atop sloped 
earth. Others are broken, and several have apparently 
fallen into the dark depths. A few similar pillars are visi­
ble on the opposite side of the ravine. 
A sturdy, knotted rope is tied to one of the leaning pil­
lars on this side of the ravine. 
Though the kobolds (areas 13-24) and the goblins (areas 
31-41) claim the Sunless Citadel as their property, they've 
never visited all its chambers. They avoid entering the most 
secluded parts of the grove level. In the past, they feared that 
the hidden grove was haunted. With the arrival of Belak the 
Outcast twelve years ago, that belief is vindicated. He orders 
the goblins to distribute the midsummer fruit each year, and 
the goblins obey him out of fear. 
Monsters on Alert. The kobolds and the goblins respond 
similarly if attacked. Intruders who fall back to take a long 
rest before dealing with the leaders of an attacked community 
allow the creatures time to make preparations. Alerted mon­
sters reinforce cleared rooms with forces previously stationed 
in other rooms. For example, three kobolds from one area 16 
could be stationed in area 15 with orders to set an ambush for 
returning invaders. Or, four goblins from one area 36 could be 
redeployed to area 32 to guard against another intrusion. Keep 
track of such changes, so that the characters don't encounter 
the same kobolds or goblins twice. 
Random Treasure. Each regular kobold and goblin is likely 
to have 2dl0 sp, perhaps in the form of various coins and 
crude jewelry. 
CHAPTER 1 I THE SUNLESS CITADEL II 

--- PAGE 13 ---

I2 GENERAL FEATURES 
The following facts about the environment are true unless 
otherwise noted in a specific area description. 
Doors. The doors are wooden or stone. 
Light. Beyond area 2, many rooms in the underground 
dungeon are lightless. Descriptions assume that the char­
acters have a suitable light source and are able to see their 
surroundings. 
Ventilation. All keyed areas contain an adequate air sup­
ply. The air is renewed from countless cracks leading to the 
upper open cavern and the surface. These cracks are too 
small for any but creatures such as giant rats to navigate. 
The ravine runs for several miles in either direction , 
with an average depth and width of 30 feet. At the point 
where it most closely intersects the Old Road, it widens 
to 40 feet. 
Investigating. The pillars are worn and broken, and 
graffiti in the Dwarvish alphabet covers most of them. 
Characters who know Goblin (after translating the let­
ters from Dwarvish) recognize the inscriptions as warn­
ings and threats against potential trespassers. 
A successful DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) or 
Wisdom (Survival) check reveals that the area in and 
around the pillars has hosted many small campfires, 
some of as recent as a month ago. Someone went to 
some effort to hide the evidence of the camps from ca­
sual scrutiny. 
Descending. The rope tied to one of the leaning pil­
lars hangs down into the darkness of the ravine. Judging 
by its good condition, the rope couldn't have been tied 
there any longer than two or three weeks ago. From the 
edge of the ravine, older and weathered handholds and 
footholds can be seen carved into the cliff face. These 
are goblin-carved. 
Adventurers can easily climb down the knotted rope, 
using the wall to brace themselves. Using the carved 
indentations is slower but only slightly harder. The de­
scent is 50 feet to the ledge (area 1). 
LOCATIONS ON THE FORTRESS LEVEL 
The following locations are identified on map 1.1. 
1. LEDGE 
A sandy ledge overlooks a subterranean gulf of darkness 
to the west. The ledge is wide but rough. Sand, rocky 
debris, and the bones of small animals cover it. A rough­
hewn stairwell zigs and zags down the side of the ledge, 
descending into darkness. 
The far wall of the chasm is 250 feet to the west, and the 
bottom of the subterranean vault is 80 feet below where 
the characters stand. 
Creatures. Drawn by the occasional animal that ac­
cidentally falls into the ravine, three giant rats lurk in 
the rubble. They try to hide if they become aware of the 
characters, and they ambush the first character who ar­
rives on the ledge without being quiet about it. 
Investigating. A successful DC 10 Wisdom (Sur­
vival) check reveals humanoid footprints, as well as rat 
CHAPTER I I THE SUNLESS CITADEL tracks of unusually large size. The footprints lead down 
the stairs. 
Among the rubble is an old ring of stones that con­
tains (and is covered by) the accumulated ash of hun­
dreds of fires, though no fire has been lit here for a few 
years. Inside the ash pile are a few rough-hewn spear 
tips of goblin manufacture and small animal bones. 
2. SWITCHBACK STAIRS 
The 5-foot-wide stairs that descend from area 1 are 
roughly carved. They aren't dangerous to traverse, how­
ever, except that combat while on the narrow path can 
be risky. Three small landings lie along the route, the 
first at 60 feet above the floor in area 3, the second at 40 
feet, and the third at 20 feet. 
The characters might be able to see area 3 as 
they descend. 
A fortress emerges from the darkness . The subterranean 
citadel, though impressive, seems long forgotten, if the 
lightless windows,cracked crenellations, and leaning tow­
ers are any indication. All is quiet, though a cold breeze 
blows up from below, bringing with it the scent of dust 
and a faint trace of rot. 
3. CRUMBLED COURTYARD 
The narrow stairs empty into a small courtyard, appar­
ently the top of what was once a crenellated battlement. 
The buried citadel has sunk so far into the earth that the 
battlement is now level with the surrounding floor. That 
floor stretches away to the north and south, composed of 
a layer of treacherous, crumbled masonry, which reaches 
to an unknown depth. To the west looms the surviving 
structure of what must be the Sunless Citadel. A tower 
stands on the west side of the courtyard. 
The stone courtyard, surrounded by crumbled masonry, 
contains a trap and a wooden door. 
Masonry Debris. An expanse of crumbled masonry 
surrounds the entire citadel. Those attempting to cross 
it immediately note its unsteadiness. The rubble is diffi­
cult terrain. Anyone who moves across the debris must 
make a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check for each 10 
feet traversed. On a failed check, the character is unable 
to move. If the check fails by 5 or more, a slab of ma­
sonry below the character shifts, dumping the character 
into a debris-lined cavity. Climbing back out requires a 
successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check; on a failed 
check, the victim drops back into the cavity. 
Creatures. Each time a creature falls into a cavity, 
the noise is 10 percent likely to draw ld4 giant rats 
from the dozens that infest the rubble field. Attracted 
rats move carefully and stealthily through the rubble 
to attack. 

--- PAGE 14 ---

Hidden Pit. The map shows the location of a con­
cealed trapdoor that covers a IO-foot-square. 10-foot­
deep pit. A 2-foot-wide catwalk on the we t edge allows 
access to the door that leads to area 4. It takes a suc­
cessful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception ) check to note the 
trapdoor's unmortared edge. Then, a successful DC 10 
Intelligence (Investigation) check lets a character deduce 
the location of the catwalk and how the pit operates. 
If a creature steps on the trapdoor, the lid flips open, 
dumping the creature into the pit. With a successful DC 
15 Dexterity check, a creature can use thieves' tools to 
jam the lid shut. A mechanism resets the trap 1 minute 
after the door opens, pushing it back into the closed 
position. The mechanism is in the pit wall under the 
catwalk. A creature can jam it in the open position with 
a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. 
If this check succeeds by 5 or more, the mechanism can 
be permanently disabled if desired. 
Creature. The pit contains two goblin skeletons, one 
goblin that has been dead for about a day, and one live 
giant rat. The rat, which slipped into the pit to feed on 
the fresh goblin but was caught when the trap reset, 
attacks creatures inside the pit or climbs out to attack 
those nearby. 
Treasure. The goblin corpse has a scimitar and a 
shield, as well as 23 sp and 4 gp in a belt pouch. 
4. TOWER SHELL 
This circular area is cobbled with cracked granite, upon 
which sprawl the bodies of four goblins, apparently slain 
in combat. One corpse stands with its back against the 
western wall, the spear that killed it still skewering it and 
holding it upright. Three wooden doors lead from this 
area. A hollow tower of loose masonry reaches thirty 
feet into the air, but the intervening floors and stairs are 
gone, except for a couple of crumbled ledges. 
Bodies. Investigation reveals that the four goblins 
have been dead for quite a while, and rats have gnawed 
at them. The bodies have been looted. If someone re­
moves the spear pinning the goblin to the wall, the body 
slumps to reveal Draconic runes on the wall behind it. 
Those who know the Draconic language can read the 
runes as "Ashardalon." 
Secret Door. A trapped secret door leads to area 5. 
Finding the door requires a successful DC 20 Wisdom 
(Perception) check. The door opens by way of a masonry 
block that also serves as a lever, which can be pushed in 
on the left side or pulled out from the right. 
Needle Trap. If the lever is pulled out, that movement 
sets off a needle trap. The needle extends 3 inches out 
of the opening, dealing 1 piercing damage to whoever 
pulled the lever. Someone who carefully and slowly 
pulls the lever open can easily see the needle before it 
strikes. Disabling the needle requires thieves' tools and 
a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. If the check fails 
by 5 or more, the trap goes off, stabbing the character 
unless the character succeeds on a DC 15 Dexterity 
saving throw. ®~

5. SECRET POCKET 
This pocket chamber is damp and cold. The skeletons of 
three long-dead archers slump against rubble-filled arrow 
slits along the east and south wall. 
The skeletons date back to the time before the citadel 
plunged into the earth. That calamity killed all three 
archers, at the same time instilling in them the curse of 
undeath. If anyone enters this chamber, the three skele-

Treasure. Each skeleton has twenty arrows, 2d10 sp, 
ldlO gp, and one +l arrow in a special socket on the 
quiver. Because the skeletons are mindless, they don't 
use the magical arrows. 
6. OLD APPROACH 
The masonry walls of this twenty-foot-wide hall are in 
poor repair. The far end has collapsed, filling the south­
ern section with rubble. The western wall is in much 
better shape than the other walls, and it holds a stone 
door with a rearing dragon carved in relief on it. The door 
has a single keyhole, situated in the rearing dragon's 
open mouth. 
Dragon Door. The door that is carved to look like a 
dragon has a mechanical lock as well as an arcane Jock 
spell cast on it. The Strength (Athletics) check to defeat 
the arcane lock is DC 30, and the Dexterity check to 
bypass the magical lock using thieves' tools is DC 25. 
Casting a knock spell on the door suppresses the mag­
ical lock for 10 minutes, lowering the DCs by 10 during 
that time. The mechanical lock remains intact if the 
magical lock is bypassed , requiring another knock spell 
or the use of the key. The key, which bypasses the magi­
cal lock as well as the mechanical one, is in area 21. 
Creature. One giant rat hides in the rubble. The rat 
attacks anyone who moves to within 5 feet of the edge of 
the rubble or anyone left alone in this area. 
7. GALLERY OF FORLORN NOTES 
As the door opens, a hissing noise and a puff of dust 
around the door indicate that the chamber beyond has 
been sealed for ages. Dust, long undisturbed, covers ev­
ery surface in this large gallery. The air here is stale. 
Three alcoves are on the north wall, and one is on the 
south wall. Each alcove contains a dust-covered stone 
pedestal with a fist-sized crystalline globe resting on it. 
The globes in the northern alcoves are cracked and dark, 
but the globe in the southern alcove glows with a soft 
blue light. Faint tinkling notes issue from it. 
If a character moves within 5 feet of the lit globe, brood­
ing music begins to play throughout the area, and the 
sound carries into areas 6, 8, and 9 if the doors to those 
areas are open. Any creature that can hear the music 
must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a suc­
cessful save, a creature is immune to the music of the 
globe for 24 hours. On a failed save, a creature becomes 
charmed and, while charmed in this way, can take only 
the Dash action and move toward area 3. 
The effect on a creature ends once that creature 
reaches the floor beyond the pit trap in area 3. If an 
affected creature is prevented from moving to area 3, 
CHAPTER l I THE SUNLESS CITADEL the creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of 
each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success­
ful save. The effect ends on its own 1 minute after the 
creature can no longer hear the music. A creature can 
escape the music by being on the other side of a closed 
door that leads to the gallery, or by vacating the area (in­
cluding adjacent rooms) where the music is audible. 
The globe has AC 10 and 10 hit points. If it is attacked 
or handled, the music becomes louder, audible in areas 
4 and 10 if the doors to those areas are open. The DC 
of the Wisdom saving throw then increases to 20. If the 
globe is reduced to O hit points or taken from the room, 
it cracks and goes dark and silent. It no longer functions. 
8. PRESSURE PLATE 
I The air is stale in this twenty-foot-long corridor, which 
leads to another closed stone door. I 
Arrow Trap. Each time any weight is placed on any 
part of the center 10-foot-square section of the corridor, 
a mechanical pressure plate is activated, triggering a 
trap. An arrow fires from above the western door at the 
creature who triggered the trap: +5 to hit, 5 (ldlO) pierc­
ing damage. 
With a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) 
check, a character can deduce the presence of the 
pressure plate from variations in the mortar and stone 
around it, compared to the surrounding floor. Wedg­
ing an iron spike or some other similarly sized and 
sturdy object under the pressure plate prevents it from 
activating. 
9. DRAGON RIDDLE 
Dust fills this hall like a layer of gray snow. In the 
rounded northern end of the chamber stands a ten-foot­
tall sculpture of a coiled dragon carved from red-veined 
white marble. 
Dragon Sculpture. If a creature moves within 5 feet 
of the dragon statue, a magic mouth spell causes the 
dragon to utter a riddle in Common (to viewers, it seems 
as though the stone jaws are actually moving). The drag­
on's riddle is as follows: 
We come at night without being fetched; 
we disappear by day without being stolen. 
What are we? 
(Answer: stars) 
Secret Door. A secret door in the western wall leads 
to area 10. Finding the door requires a successful DC 
20 Wisdom (Perception) check. Under the scrutiny of 
detect magic, the door radiates a faint aura of abjuration 
magic. The door comes open, pivoting into the room, 
only if someone speaks the answer to the riddle. 
Once the door is opened, it closes on its own 1 minute 
later, although any obstruction placed in the doorway 

--- PAGE 16 ---

prevents it from doing so. The door can be opened from 
the western side with a simple push. 
10. HONOR GUARD 
Dust cloaks the contents of this twenty-foot-wide hall. 
Six alcoves line the walls, three to the north and three to 
the south. Each alcove except the southwest one holds a 
humanoid figure carved of red-veined white marble. The 
figures resemble tall elves in plate armor. A stone arch­
way at the west end of the hall opens into a wide room 
from which greenish light glows. A dark pit is situated 
before the archway. 
Southwest Alcove. A successful DC 10 Wisdom 
(Perception) check reveals that the dust in the room 
is disturbed by tracks that start in the southwest al­
cove, though the tracks are filled in enough that the 
disturbance must have occurred dozens of years ago. 
A successful DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check enables a 
character to determine that the tracks were made by tiny 
humanoid feet with claw-like nails. They begin in the 
center of the alcove, move west toward the pit, and then 
disappear into the pit. A character who enters the pit to 
follow the tracks must make another successful DC 10 
Wisdom (Survival) check to pick up the trail again. 
Spiked Pit. The pit is 10 feet deep, and its bottom is 
filled with spikes that deal 11 (2d10) piercing damage 
to a creature that falls in, as well as falling damage. The walls of the pit are rough, and they offer handholds to 
climbers. Area 12 begins on its far side. 
Creature. A quasit named Jot was bound in the 
southwestern alcove an age ago to guard the contents 
of the sarcophagus in area 12. It was in suspended 
animation until a few decades ago, and it now waits on 
the other side of the arch just out of sight in area 12. Jot 
is alerted by any light source the characters have, so it 
can prepare for them. (If the characters have no light 
source and are stealthy,Jot might not become aware 
of them.) The quasit darts out of its hiding place and 
attacks the first creature that climbs out of the pit on the 
western side. 
Development. Jot doesn't fight to the death. If it takes 
any damage, or if more than one character attacks it, 
Jot laughs and says, "You broke the binding. My watch 
over the dragonpriest is over!" It uses its next action to 
become invisible. It then turns into a bat and flies along 
the 10-foot-high ceiling across the pit. 
If Jot escapes, the characters might see it again. It 
knows that death on the Material Plane means a return 
to the Abyss, so it prefers to harass the characters while 
they are otherwise engaged, laughing and mocking as 
it does so. 
Secret Door. Finding the door on the southern wall 
requires a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) 
check. The door opens with a simple push inward. 
11. SECRET ROOM 
I Dust coats the contents of this tiny chamber, obscuring 
runes inscribed on the southern wall. 
Inscription. If the southern wall is cleared of dust, I 
the runes are revealed to be a message in Draconic. 
Someone who can read the language understands it as 
"A dragonpriest entombed alive for transgressions of the 
Law still retains the honor of his position." 
Secret Door. A secret trapdoor in the floor requires 
a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check to find. 
The door opens by pulling it upward. It leads to a 3-foot­
by-3-foot crawl space that connects to a similar trapdoor 
in area 12. 
12. TOMB OF A FAILED DRAGONPRIEST 
Violet marble tiles cover the floor and walls, though all 
are cracked or broken, revealing rough-hewn stone be­
neath. Sconces are attached to the walls at each corner. 
One holds a torch that burns with greenish fire. A marble 
sarcophagus, easily nine feet long, lies in the room's 
center. The coffin is carved with dragon imagery, and 
the head of the sarcophagus resembles a dragon's head. 
Rusting iron clasps firmly lock down the lid. 
Torch. The greenish fire is a continual flame spell. 
Sarcophagus. Six rusted iron latches hold down 
the sarcophagus lid. Opening a single latch requires a 
CHAPTER I I THE SUNLESS CITADEL r5 

--- PAGE 17 ---

16 successful DC 15 Strength check. If the six latches are 
opened, the lid can be removed with a successful DC 
15 Strength check or by the effort of any combination of 
characters whose combined Strength is 30 or higher. 
Inside, a dragonpriest lies imprisoned, kept alive by 
virtue of a sequester spell that is dispelled with a flash of 
green light when the sarcophagus is opened. If the char­
acters look inside, read: 
In the coffin is a troll! It's dressed in rotted finery, but its 
jewelry and rings adorned with tiny silver dragons still 
sparkle. The creature's body is shrunken and elongated, 
and its flesh is a rubbery, putrid green. Its black hair is 
long, thick, and ropy. Its beady black eyes flash open, and 
it snarls. 
This dragonpriest delved into magic that the dragon cult 
deemed profane-he permanently transformed himself 
from an elf into a troll. For this crime, the cult entombed 
him alive, though the honor of his station remained. The 
dragonpriest attacks his rescuers, his mind all but trans­
formed to that of a troll over the ages of his burial. He 
had a name, but he has forgotten it, although he has not 
forgotten how to speak Elvish and Draconic. 
Creature. In his current state, the dragonpriest is 
slower and weaker than a normal troll. Use troll statis­
tics, but the dragonpriest starts with 30 hit points, re­
generates only 5 hit points per round (up to normal for a 
troll), and can't use Multiattack. If he is defeated in this 
state, the dragonpriest is worth 450 XP. 
Development. The dragonpriest won't pursue fleeing 
characters. Instead, he continues to repose in his tomb 
until hunger finally draws him forth to hunt five days 
later. By that time, he uses the normal troll statistics, 
retaining his additional languages. 
Treasure. The dragonpriest has an ornate cere­
monial dagger (worth 125 gp), two silver rings (15 gp 
each), and a silver amulet (15 gp). Scattered across the 
bottom of the sarcophagus are 220 sp, 50 gp, and four 
spell scrolls: command, cure wounds (2nd level), inflict 
wounds (2nd level), and guiding bolt (2nd level). 
13. EMPTY ROOM 
Several empty rooms in the fortress have the same char­
acteristics. Nothing of note can be found in any of them. 
l This ruined chamber stands empty of all but a litter of ] 
rocky debris. 
14. ENCHANTED WATER CACHE 
l The stone relief-carved door sealing this chamber por- ] 
trays a dragon-like fish swimming. 
The door is locked but can be opened with thieves' tools 
and a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. 
CHAPTER 1 I THE SUNLESS CITADEL RANDOM ENCOUNTERS 
In areas 13 and beyond, monsters move through the halls 
of the Sunless Citadel. For every 12 hours the characters 
spend in the dungeon, roll a d20 and refer to the following 
table if the characters are in an accessible hallway or room 
at that time. 
d20 Encounter 
ld6 kobolds 
2 1 d6 giant rats 
3 ld4 goblins 
4 ld2 hobgoblins 
5 1 d4 skeletons 
6 ld6 twig blights 
7-20 No encounter 
If the door is opened, read: 
This ten-foot-square chamber is hewn from stone. It 
contains an upright keg fashioned of rusted iron. Rusted 
pipes lead from the keg into the floor. 
If anyone shakes or strikes the keg, the sound of slosh­
ing liquid comes from inside it. The connecting pipes 
hold the keg in place, preventing it from being detached. 
The characters can remove a wide metallic bung on the 
keg's top with a successful DC 15 Strength check, or 
someone can easily stave in the side of the keg. 
Creatures. If the keg is breached, the ice mephit and 
the steam mephit confined within it are released. The 
creatures attack anyone who has disturbed the keg. 
Treasure. Within the keg are five tiny sapphires 
(worth 10 gp each) used to bring about the magic that 
bound the mephits. 
15. DRAGON CELL 
Crudely executed symbols and glyphs, scribed in bright 
green dye, decorate this large and irregularly shaped 
crumbling chamber. A large pit in the center shows evi­
dence of a recent fire. A metallic cage in the middle of the 
southern wall contains a gaping hole and stands empty. 
A small wooden bench draped with green cloth is next to 
the cage, and several small objects rest on it. A bedroll 
lies near the wooden bench, and the sound of whimper­
ing comes from inside it. 
Until recently, the kobolds confined a white dragon 
wyrmling in the cage and placed it under heavy guard. 
Those guards were not strong enough to stand against a 
sortie by goblins that stole the wyrmling a week ago. 
Creature. Meepo, the kobold who was his tribe's 
Keeper of Dragons, is now the sole occupant of the 
chamber. He is heartsick at the loss of the wyrmling and 
spends much of his time nowadays in nightmare-ridden 
sleep in his bedroll. With the loss of his charge, Meepo's 
status is in the gutter. He doesn't react to anything short 
of loud noise or direct prodding. 

--- PAGE 18 ---

If he is disturbed, Meepo is frightened but willing 
to talk. He is weepy. His numerous obvious scars are 
souvenirs of his job as Keeper of Dragons. If he is asked 
about the cage or queried in any way that mentions a 
dragon, he says, "The clan's dragon ... we lost it. The 
wretched goblins stole Calcryx, our dragon!" 
To all other questions, Meepo responds by saying, 
"Meepo don't know, but Yusdrayl does. Meepo take you 
to meet Yusdrayl, our leader, if you make nice. You get 
safe passage, if you promise to make nice. Maybe if you 
promise to rescue dragon, Yusdrayl make nice to you, 
answer questions." 
Meepo perks up as he senses the possibility of getting 
the dragon back. True to his word, he guides the char­
acters to area 21. Along the way, he shouts out "Tickle­
corn!" (in Draconic) from time to time, explaining that 
it's a password that tells other kobolds the characters 
are friendly. If the characters leave Meepo behind, or if 
they are antagonistic toward him, the characters don't 
learn the password, and all other kobolds are hostile 
toward the party. 
Development. If combat occurs in this chamber, the 
kobolds in the nearby area 16 are alerted, and they rush 
out to meet enemies. 
Investigating. The symbols on the walls are crudely 
formed in Draconic and read, "Here There Be Dragons." 
The metallic cage is all but destroyed and can't be used 
to restrain captives. A search of the cage reveals white 
scales that someone who has proficiency in Nature or 
Survival can determine to be from no natural animal. A 
successful DC 15 check using either skill identifies the 
scales as those of a white dragon wyrmling. The firepit, 
if its ashes are sifted, is found to hold charred bits of ko­
bold bones and armor. 
Treasure. The bench serves as a sort of tiny altar. 
Resting on it are containers of green dye. a paintbrush 
made of goblin-hair bristles, and four tiny jade figurines 
of dragons (worth 15 gp each). A thorough search of the 
firepit and a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) 
check reveals another jade figurine. 16. KOBOLD GUARDROOM 
Three rooms in the fortress serve as kobold guard sta­
tions. All have the same characteristics. 
Door Trap. The door leading to the room is trapped 
with a tripwire that the kobolds connect after shutting 
the door. Hitting this tripwire, 2 inches off the ground 
stretched between opposite door frames and running 
up the frame, causes the trap to trigger. A character 
who succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check 
spots the wire. If a character then succeeds on a DC 10 
Dexterity check using thieves' tools, the tripwire is cut 
without triggering the trap. A character can attempt this 
check using any edged weapon or edged tool in place of 
thieves' tools, but does so with disadvantage. 
On a failed Dexterity check, the trap triggers, tipping 
over a clay pot of offal, garbage, and dragon droppings 
that falls on any creature in the doorway and splatters in 
a 5-foot radius. A creature hit by the stuff must succeed 
on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned 
for 1 minute. An affected creature can repeat the saving 
throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on 
itself on a successful save. 
The kobolds release the tension on the tripwire when 
they exit, meaning that any guardroom that has been 
vacated can be entered safely. 
A small pit of embers, built of broken masonry and 
portions of shattered stone sculptures, smolders in the 
center of this chamber. Arrayed around the pit are several 
small rugs woven of matted hair and dead fungi. 
Creatures. The room serves as a barracks and guard 
post for the kobold tribe's warriors. Three kobolds 
stand guard inside, unless they have already come forth 
to reinforce other kobolds. 
If the characters try to talk and the interaction is suc­
cessful, the kobolds direct the characters to head toward 
"Yusdrayl on her dragon throne," giving them simple 
directions to area 21 and warning them to avoid rousing 
the ire ofYusdrayl's elite guards. 
17. DRAGON CHOW 
A character who approaches the door can smell the 
stench of what lies beyond. If the door is opened, read: 
Rats fill the room, trapped among their own waste. A 
small half-barrier prevents the rats from easily escaping 
when the door is open. 
Creatures. The rats are used as food for the dragon 
wyrmling that was once stabled in area 15. Since the 
abduction of the dragon, the kobolds have neglected the 
rats, and in the meantime the rodents have chewed away 
the fastenings of the barrier. One round after someone 
opens the door, the rats knock the barrier over and rush 
out, attacking as a swarm of rats for 1 round, after 
which they disperse into the dungeon. 
CHAPTER 1 I THE SUNLESS CITADEL 17 

--- PAGE 19 ---

18 18. PRISON 
Each door that lead to the prison chamber is locked, 
requiring a DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools 
to unlock, and also barred on the outside with an iron 
rod. If a character attempts to open either door while 
any kobolds are present, the kobolds warn against doing 
so. Opening a door in spite of this warning turns the 
kobolds hostile. 
Four small humanoids are shackled by thick, rusted 
chains attached to a large iron spike set in the floor. 
Several broken weapons and sundered shields lie in 
one corner. 
Creatures. Four goblins are chained here, taken 
prisoner during the course of several skirmishes. Every 
so often, the kobolds remove a goblin from the room 
and ransom it back to the goblins (for a price of 2d10 
sp). Those who can't be ransomed are bound for the 
kobold cook pot. The goblins whine and cower patheti­
cally if any characters enter the room. A character who 
succeeds on a DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' 
tools can open the lock on the chains, or the chains can 
be broken (Strength DC 20) or sundered (AC 15, 60 
hit points). 
The goblins promise anything and everything in ex­
change for their release, including safe passage for the 
characters to their chief. The creatures have no power 
to guarantee their promises, however. In addition, if the 
goblins are released, any understanding the characters 
have with the kobolds is voided. Freed goblins flee at the 
first hint of trouble, and they double-cross their rescuers 
if threatened by other goblins. 
19. HALL OF DRAGONS 
A double row of relief-carved marble columns march the 
length of this long, large hall. The worn carvings depict 
entwining dragons. 
Creatures. An elite squad of three kobolds (each with 
7 hit points) patrols the hall, considering the duty an 
honor. The guards pay particular attention to the door 
that leads to area 24, which is along the route tradition­
ally used by goblin raiders. These kobolds react to the 
character's presence in the same way as the ordinary 
ones described in area 16. If the characters head for 
area 21 without causing hostilities, these guards follow 
the characters into Yusdrayl's presence. 
Development. If combat erupts here, the result is 
likely to be deadly for the party. Any kobolds remaining 
in the areas nearby enter the room as reinforcements. 
Yusdrayl and her two guards arrive from area 21 at the 
start of the second round of combat. At the start of the 
fifth round, the kobolds in the area 16 to the southwest 
of this room come on the scene. At the start of the 
eighth round, the kobolds from area 23 enter the fray. 
(Kobolds that leave their original area and are slain here 
should be noted for possible future reference.) 
CHAPTER I I THE SUNLESS CITADEL 20. KOBOLD COLONY 
The strong wooden door that leads to the kobolds' living 
quarters is barred from the inside. Characters who give 
the proper password ("Ticklecorn!" spoken in Draconic; 
see area 15) or who make a successful DC 15 Charisma 
(Deception) check can convince the kobolds within to 
unbar the door. Otherwise, the kobolds open the door 
only when guards return to the room for a shift change. 
Several small but smoky fires light this wide and high 
chamber. Spits, tanning racks, and other implements of 
a primitive culture are visible through the haze. Several 
small figures busily work and play within the chamber. 
Twenty-four kobolds occupy the room, but only three ko­
bolds are capable warriors that challenge unescorted in­
truders. Seven other kobolds are commoners, but with 
3 hit points each, and a -1 reduction to hit and damage 
compared to the Monster Manual statistics. The other 
tribe members here are too young, too old, or too cow­
ardly to defend themselves; they flee if combat breaks 
out and are worth no XP. Even the kobolds capable of 
fighting run away if they are outmatched. 
The kobolds here answer all questions with a quick 
"Yusdrayl knows." 
An attack on these kobolds brings reinforcements, as 
described in area 19, though each group arrives 1 round 
later because of the extra distance it must traverse. 
21. DRAGON THRONE 
A short throne stands near the west wall, constructed of 
fallen bits of masonry stacked against an old altar. On 
the top of the altar sit a variety of small items. The por­
tion of the altar that serves as the throne's back features 
a carving of a rearing dragon. A metallic key is held firmly 
in the dragon's open jaws. 
Creatures. Normally sitting on the throne is the ko­
bolds' leader, Yusdrayl (see appendix B). Two elite ko­
bolds (7 hit points each) guard her. Those who come to 
Yusdrayl's chamber can talk to her; she is hostile only if 
she knows that the characters have slain other kobolds. 
Characters who antagonize her while talking earn the 
leader's ire and a savage attack. 
Yusdrayl can speak to the following questions: 
Why are kobolds in this place? "Kobolds are heir to 
dragons. As the mightiest among my people, I have 
led a brave few to this ancient holy site, where dragons 
were worshiped long ago." Yusdrayl knows nothing 
else about the history of the fortress, except the name 
of the dragon that was once revered here, which is 
Ashardalon. 
What about the goblins/fruit/Belak? "The Outcast, he 
lives below. He grows the fruit, which he gives to the 
goblins. The dragon-thieving goblins are his servants!" 

--- PAGE 20 ---

What about the twig monsters? "The twig blights are 
pets of the Outcast. They are more numerous below, 
in the Twilight Grove." 
What about the Jost human adventurers? -They went to 
fight the goblins and never returned ." 
What about the stolen wyrmling dragon? "The goblins 
stole our dragon! If you return Calcryx to us. I shall 
grant you a reward. Meepo can accompany you if 
you desire." 
If the characters decide to go looking for the dragon, the 
kobolds direct them toward the passage that connects 
area 15 and area 25, which is the "back way" into goblin 
territory. Yusdrayl and her followers know nothing use­
ful about the goblin lair. If the characters take Meepo 
with them, he can serve as their guide to that location. If 
Meepo goes along and is slain, the kobolds count it as a 
small loss as long as the dragon is rescued. 
Possible rewards include the key in the carved drag­
on's mouth, or any two of the items on the altar. Yusdrayl 
is also willing to sell the key for 50 gp. 
Development. If hostilities break out, reinforcements 
arrive in the manner described in area 19. 
If the characters return Calcryx, Yusdrayl can be 
convinced to aid them in an assault on the remaining 
goblins. You determine the nature of the aid. 
Treasure. The key clenched in the mouth of the 
carved dragon opens the door to area 7. Yusdrayl has 
keys to area 18 and the chains there, a key to the doors 
in area 24, and a key that once fit the cage in area 15. 
She also has 35 gp. 
The items assembled on the altar include a Quaal's 
feather token (tree), three spell scrolls (mage armor, 
spider climb, and knock), and a small flask that contains 
three doses of elixir of health. 
22.LARDER 
The odor of rotting meat permeates this chamber. Most 
of the rusty iron hooks in the ceiling are empty, but a few 
hold the skinned carcasses of large vermin, huge fungoid 
stalks, and several massive insect carapaces. On a small, 
battered bench along the south wall are pieces of nearly 
useless cutlery and rusting skinning knives. 
The kobolds bring food for their tribe up from the Un­
derdark and store it in a nearby chamber. The rotting 
flesh is that of rats, bats, overlarge cave crickets, beetles, 
goblin parts, and spiders. The room also has a selection 
of fungi and mushrooms. 
23. UNDERDARK ACCESS 
The floor is partially collapsed on the east side of this 
room, revealing a tunnel. The passage is unworked, and 
it fluctuates widely in width, height, and direction as nat­
ural tunnels do. Within the room, hunting gear is racked 
on the wall, and several pallets lie nearby. The kobolds used the natural passage to first enter the 
Sunless Citadel, and they continue to travel through it 
for hunting and gathering forays into the Underdark. 
The tunnel leads beyond the scope of this adventure, 
but it could be a route to a site you have designed. 
Creatures. If they have not come forth as reinforce­
ments, three kobolds camp here, serving as hunters 
and guardians of the tunnel. They react as described 
in area 16. 
24. TRAPPED ACCESS 
The doors on both ends of the corridor are locked and 
can be opened by a character who succeeds on a DC 20 
Dexterity check using thieves' tools. 
I At the other end of a twenty-foot-long corridor is another I 
closed door. 
Hidden Pit. The map shows the location of a con­
cealed trapdoor. A 2-foot-wide catwalk along the pit's 
center allows safe passage over the pit. With a success­
ful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character no­
tices the door's unmortared rim. After that, a character 
who makes a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Investiga­
tion) check deduces the location of the catwalk, as well 
as how the pit operates. 
If a creature steps on the pit cover, the lid flips open, 
dumping the creature 10 feet into the pit. With a suc­
cessful DC 15 Dexterity check, a creature can use 
CHAPTER 1 I THE SUNLESS CITADEL 

--- PAGE 21 ---

QO thieves' tools and an object, such as an iron spike. to 
wedge the lid shut. 
Kobolds regularly check the trap and manually reset it 
when necessary. 
25. EMPTY CHAMBER 
Two empty chambers in the eastern end of the fortress 
have the same characteristics. 
l This empty chamber is home only to rat droppings, ] 
crumbled flagstone, and stains. 
Investigating. A character who succeeds on a DC 
15 Wisdom (Perception) check notices tracks in the 
dust. Some tracks were made by rats and some by hu­
manoids. A character who then succeeds on a DC 15 
Wisdom (Survival) check ascertains that the rat tracks 
are very recent, maybe a day old, and that the humanoid 
tracks are almost a month old and \.Vere made by three 
or four human-sized humanoids moving across the area 
to the north. 
Trap. The door that connects the northernmost empty 
chamber with area 31 contains a trap. See area 31 for 
more details. 
26. DRY FOUNTAIN 
Dust and odd bits of stony debris and rubble lie scat­
tered on the floor. An ornate fountain is built into the 
eastern wall. Though cracked and stained, the fountain's 
overarching carving of a diving dragon retains its beauty. 
A relief-carved stone door stands on the western wall. 
Investigating. The debris and dust covering the floor 
display the same tracks described in area 25. 
Fountain. A thin layer of scum coats the fountain's 
basin, but it is otherwise dry. Under the scrutiny of a 
detect magic spell, the fountain emits an aura of con­
juration. A character who makes a successful DC 15 
Wisdom (Perception) check notices a mostly worn-away 
inscription in Draconic on the basin's front. It reads, 
"Let there be fire." 
If a character speaks the phrase aloud, the magic 
of the fountain functions one last time. Reddish liquid 
begins to well from the diving dragon's mouth, slowly ac­
cumulating in the basin. If the liquid is collected, it can 
be used as a potion of fire breath. After it is used in this 
way, the fountain loses its magic. 
Western Door. Carvings on the western door show 
skeletal dragons. A Draconic inscription on the door 
reads, "Rebuke the dead, open the way." Within 5 feet of 
the door, the air is noticeably cooler, and the door itself 
is cold to the touch. 
The locked door opens only when someone targets 
it with a knock spell or an effect that turns undead. 
If someone does so, the door glows ghostly blue and 
swings open silently. 
CHAPTER I I THE SUNLESS CITADEL Scythe Trap. If someone tries to open the door with­
out first deactivating the lock, a scythe blade springs 
forth, targeting the area immediately in front of the 
door: +5 to hit, 4 (ld8) slashing damage. 
The blade is concealed in a slot in the ceiling, 10 feet 
up. A character who succeeds on a DC 20 Wisdom (Per­
ception) check can find the slot before the trap is sprung. 
The opening, once discovered, can be blocked with an 
iron spike or a similar object. A character who does so 
must make a DC 15 Dexterity check or Strength check. 
On a failed check, the blockage falls out when the trap is 
sprung. Alternatively, a character can use thieves' tools 
and a successful DC 20 Dexterity check to pull the trap 
mechanism out of the slot and dismantle it. Either task 
takes about a minute. 
27. SANCTUARY 
I Five dusty sarcophagi, three to the north and two to the 
south, stand on end in this silent chamber. Each of the 
carved stone coffins resembles a noble, elf-like humanoid 
in ceremonial robes. An altar, with images of dragons 
carved into its black obsidian, is set in the center of the 
west wall. A single candle burns brightly on the altar. 
Next to the candle are a small whistle and a crystal flask. 
Creatures. Five skeletons emerge en masse from 
the sarcophagi to attack those who disturb the altar or 
open any sarcophagus. These creatures pursue charac­
ters who flee. 
Treasure. The candle has a continual flame spell l 
cast on it. In the flask is a potion of resistance (fire). The 
whistle, made of crystal, has the name Night Caller in­
scribed on it in Dwarvish. See appendix A for a descrip­
tion of this item. A secret compartment in the shrine, 
requiring a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) 
check to find, holds a coffer containing six peridot jewels 
carved in a likeness of a dragon (worth 10 gp each). 
28_ INFESTED CELLS 
l This section of hallway contains six doors, all slightly ajar. l 
The area smells musky. 
The doors lead to small cells. Each door is open just 
wide enough to enable Small and smaller creatures to 
slip through without having to open it farther. 
Creatures. The two southernmost cells and the one to 
the northeast contain abandoned giant rat nests. One gi­
ant rat lives in each of the other cells. Any noise or light 
in the area attracts all three creatures. 
Investigating. A character who succeeds on a DC 
15 Wisdom (Perception) check notices tracks in the 
dust here. Some tracks were made by rats and some 
by humanoids. A character who then succeeds on a 
DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check ascertains that the 
rat tracks are recent, perhaps a few minutes old, and 
the humanoid tracks are almost a month old and were 

--- PAGE 22 ---

made by four human-sized individuals movin_ aero s 
the area to the north. Only three of those indi,·iduals re­
turned south. 
Treasure. The occupied rat nests contain hiny bits 
collected by their current owners. Poking through each 
nest turns up 2d6 -2 sp, ld6 -1 gp, and ld-+ -1 gems 
(worth 5 gp each). 
29. DISABLED TRAPS 
The cobblestone floor contains two trapdoors blocked 
open by iron spikes. The north wall holds a dry fountain 
carved with an overarching diving dragon. A faint rotten 
stench pervades the room. 
Investigating. The two marked areas on the map are 
traps that were jammed open by the lost adventuring 
party. Examining each one reveals a 20-foot-deep pit 
containing only rat bones, rusted metal bits, and filth. 
Chances to find or follow the trail noted in area 28 
are similar here. The trail of the missing adventuring 
party skirts around the traps and leads to the western 
wooden door. 
Development. Those who spend more than 3 rounds 
in the chamber conversing in normal tones, or other­
wise making noise, draw the attention of the inhabitants 
of area 30, who hide to ready an ambush. 
Trapped Fountain. The dry fountain on the northern 
wall looks remarkably like the one described in area 26. 
Under the scrutiny of a detect magic spell, the fountain 
emits a faint aura of evocation. A successful DC 20 
Wisdom (Perception) check reveals suspicious metallic 
tubes in the carved dragon's mouth, as well as a small, 
rusted iron canister. A character who makes a success­
ful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check notices a mostly 
worn-away inscription in Draconic on the front of the 
basin. It reads, "Let there be death." 
Anyone who speaks this phrase aloud in Draconic 
triggers the trap. A poison mist sprays forth from the 
dragon's mouth, filling a 20-foot cube and expending 
the canister's last charge. Those in the area must make 
a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a 
creature takes 5 (ldlO) poison damage and becomes 
poisoned for 10 minutes. On a successful save, the crea­
ture takes only half the poison damage and is poisoned 
for 1 minute. 
Western Door. A character who approaches the west­
ern door can smell the stench of rotten meat coming 
from the other side. 
30. MAMA RAT 
An oppressive smell suffuses the air, rising from chewed 
carcasses of cave rats, smaller vermin, and a few human­
oid-looking creatures. The bodies lie upon a floor of filth, 
old bones, hair, and fur that combine to make a particu­
larly large and vile nest. Investigating. The humanoid corpses in the cham­
ber include two goblins, a kobold, and one human 
male-a member of the lost adventuring party (Karakas 
the ranger). 
Creatures. Three giant rats occupy the area, along 
with a monstrously swollen female diseased giant 
rat (Medium [6 feet long], 16 hit points, +5 to hit, chal­
lenge rating 1/4 [50 XP]) that the goblins call Guthash 
(Bloated One). The giant rats that hunt in the Sunless 
Citadel all descend from her. These creatures attack and 
attempt to eat all trespassers. 
Treasure. Poking through the refuse over a period of 
10 minutes uncovers 312 sp, 68 gp, and 3 gems (worth 
25 gp each). On and around the ranger's corpse are 
several items: studded leather armor, five daggers, a 
longbow, a backpack (containing a water skin, one day's 
rations, a bedroll, a tinderbox, and three torches), a 
quiver with six arrows, a potion of healing, and a pouch 
that holds 17 gp. A gold ring (worth 10 gp) on Karakas's 
finger is engraved (in Common) with his name. 
31. CALTROP HALL 
The door that leads north into this hallway is closed and 
fitted with a bell that clangs if someone opens the door 
without doing so very slowly. 
With a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, 
someone who carefully opens the door might spot the 
bell attached to the door about 3 feet off the ground. 
A character who examines the space around the door 
before opening it and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom 
(Perception) check notices the damage done to the door 
when the goblins fastened the bell to it. 
If the bell rings, the noise alerts the goblins in area 
32. They duck behind the low wall and wait to ambush 
intruders that enter the corridor. 
The ten-foot-wide hall is liberally strewn with sharp cal­
trops. On the northern wall, passage to the room beyond 
is partially blocked by a roughly mortared, three-foot­
high wall, complete with crenellations. 
Caltrops. The floor in the hallway is strewn with cal­
trops; see "Adventuring Gear" in chapter 5 of the Play­
er's Handbook. 
Creatures. Two goblins in area 32 pop up over the 
wall if they are alerted to the characters' presence. The 
creatures use ranged attacks as the characters move 
through the hall. 
Treasure. About two hundred caltrops are strewn on 
the floor. 
32. GOBLIN GATE 
The filth on the floor, stains on the walls, shabby hides, 
and firepit attest to the years of use this room has seen at 
the hands of creatures unconcerned with hygiene. On the 
eastern side of the southern wall is a crudely mortared 
half-wall, complete with crenellations. 
CHAPTER I I THE SUNLESS CITADEL 2I 

--- PAGE 23 ---

22 Creatures. Two goblins are stationed behind the 
rough, 3-foot-high wall. They are hostile to intruders, 
but unwilling to die facing a superior force. If captured, 
these goblins know the same information that Erky Tim­
bers in area 34 does. 
Development. If one of the goblins gets away, it warns 
the goblins in area 33. The alerted goblins prepare an 
ambush for intruders in that area. 
Investigating. A search of the room turns up putrid 
jerky, vinegary wine in poorly preserved water skins, 
and other worthless bits of clutter. 
33. PRACTICE RANGE 
The sound of goblins engaged in target practice might 
be heard from outside any of the doors to the prac­
tice range. 
Dozens of blunted and broken arrows lie on the cracked 
cobblestone floor, and a few protrude from three crudely 
sewn, human-sized targets hung along the center of the 
south wall. The northern third of the room is separated 
from the south by a crudely mortared and crenellated 
half-wall. A permanent camp of sorts lies north of the 
wall, complete with a fire ring and several small iron 
cook pots. 
Creatures. The three goblins assigned to watch the 
room spend some of their time shooting at the hair-and­
fur-filled burlap dummies that look vaguely like humans 
and elves. The rest of the time they drink too much 
goblin wine. 
When fighting, the goblins try to use the 3-foot-high 
wall for cover while shooting their foes. 
CHAPTER l I THE SUNLESS CITADEL Treasure. One goblin has a silver flask of dwarven 
make (worth 50 gp) filled with vile goblin wine. Another 
goblin has a key to open the locked door to area 34. 
Development. If things go badly for the goblins, one of 
them attempts to warn the goblin warriors in area 39. 
34. GOBLIN STOCKADE 
The wooden door is closed and locked. It can be opened 
by a character who succeeds on a DC 15 Dexterity check 
using thieves' tools. 
Squalor reigns in this low-ceilinged room. A large iron 
spike is driven into the floor near the door, and a small 
iron cage is set farther back. Several sets of corroded 
manacles are connected to the walls.and some still bind 
a few crumbling skeletons . 
Creatures. Three kobolds are bound with crude rope 
to the iron spike. A battered gnome lies in the cage, 
which is almost too small for him. It's easy to untie the 
kobolds. Freeing the caged gnome requires either a 
successful DC 15 Strength check to bend the bars or a 
successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools to 
open the cage lock. 
The kobolds are aware that the goblins might try to 
ransom them back to the other kobolds. Uncertain of 
their chances with the characters, the kobolds are un­
helpful and reluctant to be set free. If they are released 
and shown a clear line of retreat, the kobolds flee. They 
know very little, but they react positively to Meepo's 
presence or if they are told that the characters intend to 
free Calcryx. 
The gnome is named Erky Timbers, an acolyte with 
17 (5d6) hit points who knows Common, Draconic, 
Gnomish, and Goblin. He has the cleric's Channel Divin­
ity: Turn Undead feature, which he can use once after 
each short or long rest. 
If he is released, he helpfully answers questions. He 
knows the following information: 
Why are you here? "Months past, I was on my way to 
seek my fortune and took the Old Road. My bad luck 
that the goblin bandits caught me; I've been here ever 
since. My deity's blessings have kept me healthy; 
otherwise I'm sure I'd be dead from starvation 
and abuse." 
What about the goblins/Belak? "I've heard the goblins 
talk about the Twilight Grove down below. A wicked 
old human called Belak-a spellcaster, I suspect­
tends an enchanted garden and harvests fruit from 
something the goblins call the Gulthias Tree, but they 
speak of it only in the most terrified of whispers. The 
enchanted fruit grows on the Gulthias Tree." 
What's the deal with the fruit? "The midsummer fruit 
restores spirit and vigor to those who eat it; the pale 
midwinter fruit steals the same. Belak allows the 
goblins to sell the fruit on the surface, but I don't 
know why." 
What about the twig blights? "Twig blights live in the 
level below, with the Gulthias Tree." 

--- PAGE 24 ---

What about the lost human adventurers ? -rhe goblins 
caught three of them over a month ago. and they were 
captives with me in here for a while. They aid their 
names were Talgen, Sharwyn, and Sir Braford. The 
goblins kept them in here only about a week before 
they removed them. Belak wanted them, and that"s the 
last I've heard about that." 
Development. If the characters fail to suggest it. Erky 
Timbers asks to join the party as a temporary member. 
The gnome serves as a loyal friend. Currently, though, 
he has no gear. Those who free Erky gain XP as if they 
defeated him in combat. 
Manacles. The rusted iron restraints can bind a 
Small or Medium creature. If the characters are taken 
prisoner (see area 36) and bound here, escaping from 
the manacles requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity 
check. A set of manacles can be broken with a success­
ful DC 20 Strength check, or a character proficient with 
thieves' tools can pick the lock on a set of manacles with 
a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Manacles have AC 
15 and 15 hit points. 
35. TRAPPED CORRIDOR 
Hidden Pit. The map shows the location of a con­
cealed trapdoor. A 2-foot-wide catwalk along the pit's 
center allows safe passage over the pit. With a success­
ful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character no­
tices the door's unmortared rim. After that, a character 
who makes a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Investiga­
tion) check deduces the location of the catwalk, as well 
as how the pit operates. 
If a creature steps on the pit cover, the lid flips open, 
dumping the creature 10 feet into the pit. With a suc­
cessful DC 15 Dexterity check, a creature can use 
thieves' tools and an object, such as an iron spike, to 
wedge the lid shut. 
Development, If characters fall into the pit or other­
wise make excessive noise, the goblins in the area 36 
to the north are alerted. Alerted goblins respond in 2 
rounds. These goblins also check the trap and manu­
ally reset it. 
Treasure. A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) 
check made while searching around the pit uncovers a 
long-lost gold ring with an inset sapphire (worth 25 gp). 
36. GOBLIN BANDITS 
Three rooms in the northern part of the fortress serve 
as living quarters for goblin bandits. All have the same 
characteristics. 
The stench, garbage, and carrion here are evidence 
of years of use by unsanitary tenants. Tattered hides 
stretched on frames form six unstable hammocks 
around a much-used firepit. Battered cooking equipment 
is mixed indiscriminately with broken or worn arms 
and armor. 
Creatures. Three goblins, who proudly call them­
selves bandits, are in the room when the characters 
enter. In better times, two or more bandit groups would hunt the Old Road together, preying on travelers. Now, 
the bandits content themselves with an occasional hunt 
in the wilds of the Underdark (see area 43), as well as 
preying on the kobolds. 
Development. The goblins might try to knock the 
characters unconscious and imprison them in area 
34, locking victims into manacles. They take captured 
equipment to the goblin chief in area 41. The bandits 
are likely to try to ransom the prisoners to someone in 
Oakhurst. Kerowyn Hucrele is prepared to pay such 
a ransom, taking it out of the characters ' prospec-
tive reward. 
If things go badly for the goblins, one of them attempts 
to warn the goblin warriors in area 39. 
Investigating. A search of the room turns up putrid 
jerky, vinegary wine in poorly preserved water skins, 
and worthless bits of clutter. 
37. TROPHY ROOM 
Both of the wooden doors that offer access to the trophy 
room are closed and locked. Either door can be opened 
by a character who succeeds on a DC 15 Dexterity check 
using thieves' tools. 
Mounted and stuffed animal heads adorn the walls. The 
mounting job is sloppy, and the assortment of heads in­
cludes cattle, rats, and other not particularly impressive 
specimens. A few grisly trophies share the wall with the 
animals, including a couple of kobold heads. Smashed 
and broken cabinets and small tables litter the periphery 
of the room, mute victims of some sort of rampage. A 
rusted iron spike stands in the center of the room, trail­
ing a broken chain. Thin patches of frost coat sections of 
the walls, floor, and debris. 
Creature. Calcryx, the white dragon wyrmling, is ini­
tially out of view, resting behind a broken table. The gob­
lins used the iron chain to bind her, but she broke free 
and rampaged through the room, destroying the floor 
displays. Balsag, the bugbear responsible for capturing 
the dragon, hasn't returned to bring her under control, 
and the other goblins fear to enter. 
The wyrmling finds her current situation superior to 
her station as the kobolds' pet. She is hostile to those 
who enter this chamber. If battle breaks out and Meepo 
accompanies the party, the dragon targets him first. 
Treasure. The wyrmling has scoured the room and 
gathered all items of worth into a nest she made behind 
the table. The valuables include a dragon-shaped, jade 
figurine (worth 20 gp), a crystal goblet (5 gp), and twen­
ty-four pieces of fine silverware (1 gp each). 
Of particular note is a sealed scroll case carved of 
bone, carrying an inscription. Runes in the Dwarvish 
alphabet spell out the word "Khundrukar." An old parch­
ment is within the case. Age and water damage have 
destroyed most of it, but a short message in Dwarvish 
remains: " ... the remaining few. By order of Durgeddin 
the Black, we have created a secret dwarven redoubt. 
None shall find us; however, ... " Though the information 
CHAPTER l I THE SUNLESS CfTADEL 

--- PAGE 25 ---

makes little sense, even to most dwarves, the case and 
the parchment can fetch up to 100 gp if sold in a dwar­
ven community. 
38. GOBLIN PANTRY 
The north and south walls of this chamber are stacked 
halfway to the ceiling with ill-made barrels, boxes, and 
crates. A clear path allows easy access between the west 
and east doors. 
The goblins store water, wine, and food, none of which 
is of good quality, in a pantry accessible through two 
doors. The stockpile includes five pints of oil, along with 
a few small barrels labeled "Elf Pudding " in Goblin. 
39. DRAGON HAZE 
Several torches mounted in crude sconces burn fitfully 
around this chamber, filling the air with a haze. A double 
row of marble columns carved with entwining dragons 
runs the length of the hall. 
As long as the torches burn, the hall is lighted, but the 
haze makes the area lightly obscured. The haze never 
builds to suffocating levels, thanks to natural ventilation. 
Any loud noise in the chamber attracts the attention 
of goblins in the area 36 to the south, as well as in area 
40. The goblins in area 40 prepare for danger but don't 
leave their stations, while those in area 36 come to in­
vestigate within 2 rounds. 
40. GOBLINVILLE 
Anyone who stands within 10 feet of a door leading to 
the goblins' main living area can hear the voices of the 
goblins inside, unless they have been alerted to danger. 
What might once have been a cathedral is now a goblin 
lair, thick with the filth of years of goblin life. Scores of 
wall-and floor-mounted sconces filled with violet-glow­
ing fungi provide illumination. Dozens of goblins go 
about their daily business, which involves a lot of rude­
ness and violence. Along the southern wall is a heaping 
pile of assorted items, including wagon wheels, broken 
armor and rusted arms, chests, small statues, antique 
furniture, and artwork. 
Creatures. Thirty-four goblins are at home when the 
characters arrive, but only four of the goblins are war­
riors. Ten of the other goblins are commoners, but with 
3 hit points each and a -1 reduction to hit and damage 
compared to the Monster Manual statistics. The other 
twenty creatures are noncombatants, too feeble or too 
fearful to defend themselves; they try to flee through the 
northernmost or the eastern exit. This stampede should 
dominate the first moments of battle, and even the gob-

--- PAGE 26 ---

lins capable of fighting refuse to stick around ju t to lose 
their lives. Noncombatants are worth no XP. 
These goblinoids know the same information. in 
cruder form, that Erky in area 34 knows. 
Development. An attack on the goblins brings rein­
forcements from area 36 and warns the goblin chief in 
area 41 that something is amiss. Gren!, the goblin sha­
man in area 41, might emerge to protect the tribe. 
Investigating. The goblins collect the phosphorescent 
fungi from the grove below. They need its light for close 
work, such as reading, and the fungus is edible. Crude 
equipment for cooking, skinning game, tanning hides, 
and other basic gear fills the area. Food is usually col­
lected from the Underdark through area 43. 
Treasure. Among the tribal equipment, near the sha­
man's bedding, is a healer's kit and a poisoner's kit. 
The pile along the southern wall contains the tribe's 
loot, mixed in with lots of other stuff taken from the 
goblins' victims. The characters can find almost any 
piece of mundane gear that has a value of 5 gp or lower. 
Two items of considerable value can be unearthed by 
separate successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) checks: 
a fine agate statue of the elven deity Corellon Larethian 
(worth 30 gp) and a Medium chain shirt. 
41. HALL OF THE GOBLIN CHIEF 
If the goblinoid guards in the chief's hall have been 
alerted, or if they hear conflict in area 40, they cover the 
door for 10 minutes, then investigate the source of the 
disruptions at their leader's behest. 
j A circular shaft pierces the floor of this forty-foot-diam­
eter domed chamber. Dim violet light shines out of the 
shaft, revealing sickly white and gray vines that coat the 
walls of the shaft. The light is supplemented by four lit 
wall torches set equidistant around the periphery of the 
chamber. A crudely fashioned stone throne sits against 
the curve of the northwestern wall. A large iron chest 
serves as the throne's footstool. A sapling grows in a 1 wide stone pot next to the throne. 
Creatures. The chief of the Durbuluk tribe is Durnn, 
a hobgoblin. He wears splint armor (AC 19) and has 
18 hit points, a +4 bonus to hit, a +l bonus to damage, 
and Strength 15 (+2). These changes raise his challenge 
rating to 1 (200 XP). When not in combat, Durnn sits on 
the throne, and three other hobgoblins stand nearby or 
lounge on stone benches. 
The shaman Gren! advises the chief. She is a goblin 
with 10 (3d6) hit points, a Wisdom of 13 (+l), and the 
following trait: 
Spellcasting. Grenl is a 1st-level spellcaster. Her spellcasting 
ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 11, +3 to hit with spell attacks). 
She has the following cleric spells prepared: 
Cantrips (at will): poison spray, thaumaturgy 
l st level (2 slots): bane, inflict wounds 
A twig blight, a gift from Belak the Outcast and a pet 
of Durnn's, is in the stone pot, and goblins from area 40 occasionally enter the chamber to see to the needs of the 
tribe's elite that languish here. 
Development. Durnn has a potion of healing and two 
vials of antitoxin. Gren! has a spell scroll of faerie fire 
and another of expeditious retreat. 
The goblins in area 40 don't join the battle if they hear 
sounds of violence coming from the north. If the fight 
turns against the chief, however, he might open the door 
to area 40 and call for aid, or withdraw to area 40 to 
continue the fight. 
Durnn can't surrender for fear of losing face. He won't 
give up if the opposition includes kobolds. Otherwise, 
he might call for parley if doing so allows him to avoid 
death. But he must still look strong while negotiating , 
so he's unwilling to capitulate in an arrangement that 
makes him look weak. 
Because Durnn and his hobgoblins usurped control of 
the Durbuluk tribe, Gren! hates them. She also wants to 
protect her tribe, so she is willing to negotiate a truce if 
Durnn falls. Gren! also hates and envies Belak, and she 
wants him gone from the citadel so she can control the 
Gulthias Tree. 
If captured and interrogated, the goblinoids here know 
what Erky in area 34 knows, with the following addition: 
Belak wanted all the living human prisoners sent down 
to him, but in a fit of anger, Durnn slew Talgen. Thus, 
Durnn sent only Sharwyn and Sir Braford down to the 
Twilight Grove. 
Shaft. The shaft has a 2-foot wall around it, much like 
the upper end of a well. Because of the wall, a creature 
pushed toward the shaft can avoid going over the edge 
by falling prone and succeeding on a DC 10 Dexterity 
saving throw. Thick, pale vines line the shaft. The vines 
are as good as knotted rope for the purpose of climbing. 
A creature that falls into the shaft can make a DC 15 
Dexterity saving throw to catch the vines. On a failed 
save, the creature falls 80 feet to the floor of area 42. 
Trapped Chest. Durnn's iron chest rests in front of 
the throne. It is locked (Dexterity DC 15 using thieves' 
tools) and trapped with a poisoned needle. A character 
who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) 
check deduces the trap's presence from alterations 
made to the lock. A character can then remove the nee­
dle from the lock by succeeding on a DC 15 Dexterity 
check using thieves' tools. On a failed Dexterity check, 
the trap is triggered. 
When the trap is triggered, the needle extends 3 
inches straight out from the lock. A creature within 
striking distance takes 1 piercing damage and must 
succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 3 
(ld6) poison damage. 
Treasure. In addition to the valuables mentioned in 
the "Development" section, Durnn wears Talgen's gold 
signet ring (worth 20 gp) and splint armor, which is 
identifiable by the Hucrele family crest worked into the 
chest pieces. The chief also has the key to his iron chest. 
Gren! has keys to areas 34 and 37. One of the other 
hobgoblins wears silver earrings set with moonstones 
(20 gp each), and another wears a matching neck-
lace (50 gp). 
Inside Durnn's iron chest are 231 gp and two onyx 
gems (30 gp each).

CHAPTER 1 I THE SUNLESS CITADEL 

--- PAGE 28 ---

LOCATIONS ON THE GROVE LEYEL 
The grove level and the fortress level connect through 
the shaft that leads from area 41 to 42. The following 
locations are identified on map 1.2. 
42. CENTRAL GARDEN 
• 
Luminescent fungus, shedding violet light, clings to the 
walls and ceiling of this wide cavern. The air is damp, 
chilly, and redolent with the odors of loam and decay. A 
layer of earth, mixed with rotting vegetation and the re­
mains of cave animals, covers the floor. Several varieties 
of mushrooms and fungi grow on the detritus, as well as 
a few saplings. 
Creatures. Two robed skeletons (AC 12) serve Belak 
by tending a fungus garden, using shovels and a rusted 
wheelbarrow to turn the soil and spread compost. In 
addition, two mature twig blights are rooted in the gar­
den. The twig blights ambush intruders that aren't gob­
linoids, and the skeletons attack (with shovels, ld6 blud­
geoning damage) anything that the twig blights target. 
Development. The creatures in area 43 investigate 
any disturbance in the garden after 3 rounds. 
43. THE GREAT HUNTER'S ABODE 
The floor of this rough cavern is stained and smells of 
blood and animal musk. Light from glowing fungus re­
veals the eastern niche, which holds a pallet of matted 
furs, a wide wooden board on which a variety of weapons 
are affixed, and a great cloak of patchy black fur hung 
on a slender pole. To the edge of the niche are two large 
nests made of hair, dry fungus, and refuse. 
Creature. Balsag the bugbear and his two giant rat 
"hounds," named Grip and Fang, reside in a natural 
stone chamber when they're not hunting (25 percent 
chance of being absent when characters arrive). The 
bugbear wears a crown of antlers on his head to en­
hance his frightening appearance. Balsag considers 
all non-Durbuluk creatures to be potential prey, so he 
attacks any he meets, roaring in Goblin, "Get ready to 
meet the cook pot!" 
Underdark Access. In the dark of the northern cav­
ern section, a crude tunnel leads away, angling west and 
downward. The tunnel is like the one in area 23. 
Treasure. Two spears, six javelins, one longsword, 
one greatsword are affixed to the weapon rack. A box 
hidden under one of the furs in Balsag's bedding, requir­
ing a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to 
notice, contains 241 sp and 54 gp. 44. RIFT 
A rift opens here, its debris-strewn floor two feet below 
that of the corridor. No phosphorescent fungus grows in 
the rift. The corridor continues past the rift, though the 
opening of the rift has caused it to shift 10 feet to the 
west. A number of two-foot-diameter holes riddle the 
floor of the rift. The smell of burnt earth hangs in the air. 
The small holes in the floor extend as far down as any­
one is capable of probing. 
45. RIFT NODE 
The rift widens, creating a cavern-like chamber. Small, 
two-foot-diameter holes riddle the node. A dim fiery glow 
shines out of one such hole. 
Creature. In the glowing hall rests a fire snake. Belak 
used magic to call the creature forth and hopes to train 
it to be a loyal servant before it matures. 
Treasure. Belak has already appealed to the snake's 
greed with a small gift. In its nest, the adventurers find 
two sapphires (worth 50 gp each). 
46. OLD SHRINE 
The stone door at the end of the corridor is closed and 
stuck, requiring someone to make a successful DC 15 
Strength check to pull it open. 
Faded mosaic tiles still decorate parts of the wall, but 
most have fallen to the dust-covered floor and shattered. 
Situated at the center of the chamber stands a slim ped­
estal of rusted iron shaped like an upright dragon. In the 
dragon's mouth rests an empty tray. 
The room once held items of importance to the old 
dragon cult. The remaining features are dust-covered 
and worthless. 
47. BELAK'S LABORATORY 
Two rows of dragon-carved marble columns march the 
length of the hall, most completely covered in lumines­
cent fungus. The cobbled floor is cracked and stained, 
and on it sit many small wooden tables. The contents 
on the tables include mortars and pestles, small tools, 
bowls filled with crushed leaves, chopped fungus stalks, 
and other plant specimens. The many doors leading off 
this hall are all partly open. 
Belak prepares various experimental concoctions in his 
laboratory and the small chambers that lead off it (see 
the sections below), with the fumbling aid of goblins that 
CHAPTER 1 I THE SUNLESS CITADEL 27 

--- PAGE 29 ---

serve him. Any noise or disturbance in the main area 
draws all the monsters, although those in the northwest 
chamber respond most slowly. 
Investigating. The containers on the small tables in 
the main area hold mashed leaves, fungus, bark, and 
powdered roots. A character who makes a successful 
DC 10 Intelligence (Nature) check identifies many com­
mon varieties of tree, shrub, and fungus, although all 
have a pronounced pallor, as if sun-starved. 
Treasure. One pile of herbs and supplies in the main 
chamber contains the ingredients of a healer's kit. An 
assortment of tools and herbs can be salvaged to make 
up a herbalism kit and a set of alchemist's supplies. 
Northwest Chamber. Snores are audible from the 
room to the northwest, which is a rough barracks. 
Sixteen small pallets of matted fur cover the floor. Two 
pallets currently hold a sleeping goblin and two goblin 
commoners (like those in area 40). 
Southwest Chamber. The goblins use a crude mash­
ing, straining, and casking facility to create goblin wine, 
which they and Belak are quite fond of. Two goblin com­
moners currently stand barefoot in the mashing-tun, 
squashing roots and fungi into pulp. A dirty straining 
bin stands nearby, as well as ten 2-gallon casks of the 
end product. 
North Central Chamber. Two goblin commoners 
currently repair dirty goblin armor with cord, iron nee­
dles, leather patches, and other crude implements of 
tailoring. 
South Central Chamber. One goblin and two goblin 
commoners monitor the health of a diseased giant rat, 
which is strapped spread-eagled onto a wooden bench. 
The rat suffers from horrible tumors that look woody 
and fruit-like. Its tumors stem from an elixir Belak cre­
ated to infuse twig blight traits into giant rats. 
On a stand in the corner is a fancy crystal vial (worth 
5 gp) that contains the elixir. Drinking the elixir ex­
poses the drinker to the same disease that the diseased 
rat might impart with its bite, except the initial saving 
throw DC is 15. 
Northeast Chamber. Extra weapon stores include five 
battered scimitars, six shortbows, and forty arrows. 
Southeast Chamber. The room stands empty, and 
the caved-in back wall leads to a natural rift in the earth 
(see area 44). 
48. GARDEN GALLERIES 
The two galleries that lead to the arboretums have the 
same characteristics. The doors to all connecting areas 
are closed. 
Nodules of luminescent fungus hang from the ceiling 
and walls and grow in clumps on the flagstone floor. The 
light illuminates portions of grand bas-relief carvings 
on the stone walls that aren't covered with the fungus. 
The carvings depict dragons in various stages of raining 
fire down upon terrified people. Soil and compost cover 
half the chamber's floor, which allows a variety of feeble 
plants to grow. A bench containing simple gardening im­
plements stands along the west wall. 

--- PAGE 30 ---

Belak is using the galleries to grow aboveground Yegeta­
tion using the light of luminescent fungus. 
Creature. A bugbear gardener roams both galleries, 
tending the grasses for Belak. She is armed with a 
sickle-bladed glaive; she has a reach of 10 feet and deals 
2d10 + 2 slashing damage with it. 
Treasure. The bugbear carries a potion of healing. 
Development. The neighboring arboretums (area 49) 
contain additional monsters. The closed doors and stone 
walls prevent sound from entering these four areas. The 
creatures within join the battle here at your discretion. 
49. ARBORETUMS 
Luminescent mist blurs the edges of this octagonal 
chamber. Nodules of glowing fungus dot the stone walls 
and ceiling, as well as the caps of toadstools and mush­
rooms, small polyps, puffballs, and lichen. The humid air 
reeks with rot. 
The arboretums hold small samples of traditional Un­
derdark ecosystems, which aren't difficult for Belak to 
nurture. The stone doors leading to them are unlocked. 
Southern Arboretum. A goblin and three goblin 
commoners gather fungus for use in area 47. 
Southeast Arboretum. Several growths in the 
chamber are scorched and dead. Fungus shrouds holes 
similar to those found in area 45, and a fire snake lurks 
inside one of these openings. It emerges if anyone pokes 
into or closely examines the holes. If the snake comes 
out, a character who reaches into the snake's burrow 
can recover two sapphires (worth 50 gp each). 
Northeast Arboretum. Three skeletons -AC 12, 3 
(ld6) bludgeoning damage with shovels or rakes-are at 
work, clearing scorched plants. One twig blight, which 
is hostile to the adventurers, is with them. The skeletons 
attack anything the twig blight attacks. 
Fungus shrouds holes similar to those in area 45. 
Northern Arboretum. The northern room contains 
only its plants. 
50. ASHARDALON'S SHRINE 
Dragon-carved granite blocks line this chamber's walls 
and ceiling, though many are crumbled and broken, 
leaving stony debris on the floor. A huge marble statue of 
a rearing red dragon stands in the curve of the western 
wall. The eye sockets of the dragon are empty, but a red 
glow lingers there, providing reddish light throughout the 
chamber. The radiance casts an inky shadow behind the 
statue's wide wings. A five-foot-diameter, circular tile of 
dark stone is set in the floor in front of the dragon statue. 
Runes are carved around the circular tile's inner edge. 
Investigating. Viewed in white light, the circular tile 
is red. A detect magic spell can reveal that the tile and 
statue give off an aura of transmutation. The runes on the tile's inner edge read, in Draconic, "Let the sorcer­
ous power illuminate my spirit." If anyone speaks this 
sentence aloud while standing on the tile, a puff of spec­
tral flame harmlessly envelops the speaker, granting 
the target advantage on Charisma checks for 24 hours. 
Once the tile is activated, it is dormant for 24 hours. 
Creature. A shadow hides in the gloom behind the 
dragon statue. It attacks only those who spot it or who 
attempt to investigate the circular tile or claim the trea­
sure. The creature doesn't pursue those who flee. 
Treasure. A loose stone is in the wall behind the 
statue, requiring a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Percep­
tion) check to find. Inside are 34 gp and two flasks of 
alchemist's fire. 
51. DRAGON LIBRARY 
Leaning and fallen stone bookshelves fill this chamber, 
though a clear path connects wooden doors on opposite 
walls. Torn and burnt pages, bindings, and scrolls form 
disordered piles in the corners. 
Treasure. Rooting around in the wreckage, separate 
successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) checks uncover 
a spell scroll of scorching ray, a spell scroll of Melf's acid 
arrow, and a tome of dragon lore bound in dragon scale 
and written in Draconic (worth 150 gp). 
52. UNDERPASS 
I Damp and crumbled steps descend sharply. 
The steps descend 15 feet. An 8-foot-high stone corridor 
passes about 7 feet below the northern arboretum (area 
49), connecting the stairways on either side. 
53. BELAK 'S STUDY 
The wooden door leading to Belak's study is closed and 
locked. The lock can be undone by someone who uses 
thieves' tools and succeeds on a DC 20 Dexterity check. 
A layer of soil covers the floor. Rough wooden shelves, 
filled with a scattering of tomes and scrolls, line the 
north and east walls, and a rough-hewn desk stands in 
the center of the chamber. Fungus on the ceiling provides 
light, apparently in sufficient quantity to nourish several 
small bushes and pale saplings that grow in the soil. 
Investigating. In his study, Belak stores seasonal 
records of growth, precipitation, harvests, and similar 
notes for the surrounding lands for the last dozen years. 
One interesting tome titled (in Draconic) Treasures 
of the Fire Lords has a glyph of warding spell with an 
explosive runes effect on it. The glyph is on the second 
page, and it's triggered when someone opens to that 
page. Otherwise, the book is blank. I 
CHAPTER 1 I THE SUNLESS CITADEL ,:9 

--- PAGE 31 ---

30 If the glyph is triggered, it erupts with magical en­
ergy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the book. 
The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in 
the area must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. A 
creature takes 22 (5d8) cold damage on a failed saving 
throw, or half as much damage on a successful one. The 
cold doesn't damage the other works here. 
Development. If any obvious disturbance occurs here, 
the goblins in area 54 set an ambush for intruders. They 
wait at least 10 minutes before coming to investigate. 
Treasure. Separate successful DC 15 Wisdom (Per­
ception) checks uncover a spell scroll of entangle, a spell 
scroll of protection from poison, and a tome on druidic 
theories on the cycle of life and death (worth 150 gp). 
Cubbyholes in the desk hold 365 gp and four agate gems 
(20 gp each). 
54. GROVE GATE 
Twigs and roots are piled on the floor of this sagging 
chamber. The collapsed southern wall opens into a vast 
cavern. Luminescent fungus on the rough walls and 
the high roof loom over a twilight grove of sickly briars, 
bushes, saplings, and other woody plants. Ruined walls 
and hollow towers protrude from the briars. 
Creatures. Four goblins sort the specimens for Be­
lak. They are hostile to intruders. If things go badly for 
them, they cry out in Goblin, saying, "Aid us, Protector 
of the Twilight Grove!" 
Development. Sometimes the twig blights in area 55 
attack the goblins out of sheer malice. Thus, a call from 
the goblins doesn't bring all the forces of the cavern 
down on the characters. But if the goblins do call, four 
twig blights arrive from area 55 and attack. 
Investigating. Any character who gazes into area 55 
and succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check 
spots the blackened top of the Gulthias Tree in the dis­
tance. If the check succeeds by 3 or more, the character 
also spots the twig blights creeping around in area 55. 
55. TWILIGHT GROVE 
I Pale, spindly briars press close, casting twisted shadows I 
on the earth floor in the violet light. 
Briars. The most successful aboveground plants that 
Belak has transplanted in the Twilight Grove are the 
briars, though they appear sickly and pale, with blighted 
leaves. Other common plants and bushes are also repre­
sented, though they are equally afflicted. 
The briars don't hinder Small and smaller creatures. 
Larger creatures must either spend 2 feet of movement 
for every 1 foot moved or make a DC 10 Constitution 
saving throw for every 10 feet moved. On a failed save, 
the creature takes 1 piercing damage from the briars. 
A 5-foot-by-5-foot area of briars can be cleared if it 
takes 20 damage of any type other than psychic. 
CHAPTER I I THE SUNLESS CITADEL Creatures. Ten twig blights, less any that were dis­
patched in area 54, are spread about the grove. After 
moving 50 feet into the cavern, the characters come 
upon ld4 of the hostile creatures. Any significant noise, 
such as from combat or clearing the briars, also attracts 
ld4 -1 twig blights (minimum 0) each round. 
Development. If the characters get to area 56 before 
all the twig blights have engaged, the rest of the mon­
sters hold off their attacks. Any conflict that involves 
yelling in a language other than Goblin, the use of flashy 
magical effects, or similar noticeable elements alerts 
Belak in area 56 to the approach of invaders. 
56. THE GULTHIAS TREE 
A walled clearing is here among the briars. The walls are 
about twenty feet high, which is less than half the height 
of the cavern's ceiling. Several varieties of plants grow 
around the perimeter of the clearing, including a few sus­
picious-looking saplings, but their importance pales be­
fore that which stands at the courtyard's center. Beneath 
the fungal light grows an evil tree. Its blackened, twisted 
limbs reach upward, like a skeletal hand clawing its way 
out of the earth. Before it stand a few twig blights; a 
heavily armored, young human male with a shield and 
sword; a blonde, young human woman in a robe fit for a 
noble; and a middle-aged, bearded human male wearing 
a hooded brown robe and armed with a staff and sickle. 
The younger humans have black eyes and gray skin with 
the texture of bark. 
Creatures. Belak the Outcast spends much of his time 
studying the Gulthias Tree, but he is well aware when 
the characters are approaching. He is a human druid, 
and he has the following spells prepared: 
Cantrips (at will): druidcraft, poison spray, shillelagh 
1st level (4 slots): cure wounds, entangle, faerie fire, 
thunderwave 
2nd level (3 slots): barkskin, flaming sphere 
Standing with Belak are Sir Braford and Sharwyn 
Hucrele (both described in appendix B). Belak's giant 
frog, Kulket, lurks stealthily in the branches of the 
Gulthias Tree. A character who has a passive Perception 
score of 15 or higher or succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom 
(Perception) check spots the frog. If combat breaks out, 
the frog jumps down and joins the fight in the second 
round. Three twig blights are here, too. 
Interaction. When the characters arrive, Belak says 
loudly, "Hold a moment, you know not what you do!" If 
the characters engage him in conversation, he can share 
the following information: 
What are you doing? "I am Belak, called the Outcast. My 
circle expelled me, the fools. Why? Because I dared to 
expand nature's reach in ways they couldn't grasp. I 
have found what I sought in the Gulthias Tree." 
What is the Gulthias Tree? "It's beautiful, no? It lives, 
though it looks dead. In an age long past, someone 

--- PAGE 32 ---

THE GULTHIAS TREE 
A Gargantuan plant, the Gulthias Tree has AC 10 and 35 
hit points. It is immune to necrotic, poison, psychic dam­
age, and it has resistance to piercing damage. The tree has 
vulnerability to fire damage. 
Fruit. Two magical fruits (evocation school) ripen on the 
tree each year. Each fruit resembles an apple, but it slowly 
extrudes from the tree like a cyst. 
Up to a week before the summer solstice, a ruby red fruit 
grows. Someone other than a construct who eats a quarter 
or more ofit regains 70 hit points. In addition, any blind­
ness, deafness, and diseases affecting the eater end. 
Up to a week before the winter solstice, a sickly white 
fruit grows. Someone who eats a quarter or more of it 
takes 70 necrotic damage. Each fruit has 1 d4 seeds that, if 
planted, grow leafless woody shrubs that animate as twig 
blights after one year. 
Tree Thralls. If a humanoid is bound to the bole of the 
Gulthias Tree, over the next 24 hours the victim is sucked 
completely into the tree. Once the victim is completely 
absorbed into the tree, it becomes the tree's thrall, and 
is expelled over the course of l hour. The Gulthias Tree 
can have only four thralls at any one time. A victim's skin 
is rough, gray, and bark-like. A thrall is totally corrupted, 
becoming neutral evil. Such a creature exists only to serve 
the Gulthias Tree and those who tend it (such as Belak). It 
possesses all of its former abilities and gains the follow­
ing traits: 
Barkskin. The thrall's AC can't be lower than 16. 
Tree Thrall. If the Gulthias Tree dies, the thrall dies 24 
hours later. 
staked a vampire on this very spot. The stake took 
root. And so grew the Gulthias Tree, reverberating 
with primal power for those who can tap it." 
What's with the stick-monsters? "The twig blights grow 
from seeds of the tree's fruit." 
What's going on with the fruit? "I give fruit to the goblins 
with orders to disperse their seeds on the surface. 
Deceitful beings that they are, the goblins barter the 
fruit, but the seeds are dispersed all the same. My 
plan for colonizing the surface with the children of 
Gulthias continues." 
What did you do to the other adventurers? "They were 
the first supplicants. The Gulthias Tree has accepted 
them, and they are mine to control, just like the twig 
blights. You can't save them." 
Why are you talking to us? "Though your remains would 
enrich the compost, you'll serve my needs better as 
supplicants. You shall retain your lives, after a fashion. 
Surrender and submit peacefully, or perish!" 
While this interaction proceeds, Sir Braford, the three 
twig blights, and Belak's frog position themselves be­
tween the characters and Belak (Sharwyn stands next 
to Belak). 
Combat. If a fight breaks out (which will happen un­
less the characters actually submit to Belak), the twig 
blights, the frog, and Sir Braford attack the characters 
physically. Sir Braford uses Shatterspike (see appendix 
A) to destroy his foe's weapon, if possible. 
Belak casts barkskin on himself, possibly before 
melee occurs. He also makes early use of his wand of entangle (see appendix A), attempting to hold the trans­
gressors in place. If Braford looks like he needs healing, 
Belak casts healing spells on him, as well. Sharwyn 
uses her repertoire of spells to best advantage, resorting 
to her dagger only in desperation. 
Development. During a battle, if any twig blights re­
main in area 55, ld4 -1 of them (minimum 0) enter this 
area each round. 
Targeting the Tree. A successful DC 15 Wisdom 
(Insight) check or Intelligence (Arcana or Nature) check 
allows a character to deduce that destroying the tree 
might have an effect on Sir Braford, Sharwyn, and the 
twig blights. If anyone attacks the Gulthias Tree, Be-
lak and the twig blights try to kill the aggressor. If the 
Gulthias Tree dies, Belak loses his influence over the 
twig blights, Sharwyn, and Sir Braford. These monsters 
turn on Belak before targeting the characters again. 
Walls. The courtyard's walls stand 20 feet tall, and 
the cavern's stalactite-dotted ceiling is 50 feet up. 
Treasure. Belak has a key (to area 53), three potions 
of healing, two doses of antitoxin, and his wand of en­
tangle. Sharwyn wears her gold Hucrele signet ring 
(worth 20 gp). 
AFTERMATH 
If the characters kill the Gulthias Tree, Sharwyn and 
Braford die 24 hours later (unless you decide they can 
be saved somehow). If Belak survives, his former ser­
vants turn on him, and he attempts to escape. If he suc­
ceeds in getting away, he might appear later to trouble 
the characters. 
If the characters reveal the truth about the fruit's 
seeds to the villagers of Oakhurst , those folk cut down 
and burn all growing saplings. 
As the villagers set the evil saplings alight, the mayor 
turns to you with a frank expression. "You realize that 
our actions have set loose several of these abominations 
upon the world. Who knows what these twisted plants 
are doing now?" 
The mayor is right. Twig blights that are already loose 
in the world can still reproduce through root sprouts, as 
aspen trees do. Although it is likely a hopeless task, the 
characters can search out these twig blights and destroy 
them. It's up to you and your players to determine what 
happens next. At any rate, if the characters warn Oak­
hurst's residents about the seeds, they have taken their 
first steps toward gaining a measure of fame and estab­
lishing a rapport with local residents . 
In addition, if the characters return the Hucrele signet 
rings to the family matriarch, they receive the prom­
ised monetary award. If they bring back the remains of 
Sharwyn and Sir Braford, the matriarch begins funeral 
arrangements and invites the characters to attend. If 
they accept, they can begin to establish a long-term rela­
tionship with the Hucrele family, which can prove useful 
in later adventures. W 
CHAPTER I THE SUNLESS CITADEL 31

THE FORGE OF FURY 
WO CENTURIES AGO, THE GREAT DWARF 
smith Durgeddin the Black and his clan 
were driven from their home by a horde of 
fierce ores and trolls. They plundered the 
dwarves' ancestral halls and slew all they 
could catch. Fleeing his enemies, Durged­
din led the destitute remnants of his clan 
in search of a new home. After years of wandering, the 
dwarves discovered a great cavern system beneath the 
Stone Tooth: a rugged, forested hill crowned by a bare 
rocky crag. There Durgeddin and his followers founded 
the stronghold of Khundrukar. 
About a century ago, a member of Durgeddin's clan 
was captured by a powerful ore tribe during a raid, and 
the ores learned of their enemy's hidden stronghold. 
The ore chieftains raised a great army and marched 
on Khundrukar. In a hard-fought siege lasting months, 
the ores tunneled around the dwarven defenses. When 
they finally stormed the place, they put all within to the 
sword, then carried off wagonloads of booty. 
In the years since the great battle, various creatures 
have occupied the stronghold and used the place as a 
base for their raids. At other times, the caverns have lain 
empty except for the mindless and bloodthirsty mon­
sters that haunt such places. Today legends of Durged­
din's Vengeance (or the Smith's War) and the extraor­
dinary blades the dwarves forged in anger still surface 
from time to time in the lands near the Stone Tooth. 
ADVENTURE SYNOPSIS 
The Forge of Fury is set in the ruined stronghold of 
Khundrukar. It is designed for four 3rd-level player char­
acters. They can advance to 5th level with good play. 
The characters come to the Stone Tooth in search of 
a reputed cache of Durgeddin's superior blades and find 
the stronghold inhabited by dangerous monsters. The 
complex consists of the following five sections: 
The Mountain Door. The Mountain Door comprises the 
uppermost level of the cavern complex. It is currently 
inhabited by a tribe of fierce ores, led by a brutal ogre 
known as Great Ulfe. 
The Glitterhame. The largest level of Khundrukar, 
the Glitterhame is an expanse of beautiful natu­
ral caverns now infested by troglodytes and other 
cave-dwelling monsters. 
The Sinkhole. Streams in the Glitterhame descend to 
an underground river, which runs through a corner of 
the caverns forgotten by the denizens above. 
The Foundry. Beyond the Glitterhame lies a complex 
of chambers and passageways carved by Durgeddin's 
folk. A small band of duergar (gray dwarves) currently 
hold Durgeddin's hall, working to uncover the secrets 
of the smith's ancient forge. A great crevasse drops to 
the Black Lake. The Black Lake. The most dangerous denizen of the 
caverns under the Stone Tooth lairs in the cold, still 
waters of the Black Lake. Nightscale, a young black 
dragon, discovered a passage into the lake through 
an underwater siphon connecting to a mere on the far 
side of the hill. The dragon has claimed the ancient 
wealth of Khundrukar as her hoard. 
CHARACTER HOOKS 
You can place the Stone Tooth and its caverns anywhere 
you like in your campaign world. The Forge of Fury 
works well if you pick a remote range of rugged hills or 
highlands several days from the nearest community. 
The town of Blasingdell is briefly described in this ad­
venture, if you need a location where the characters can 
make their final preparations. 
Your next task is to decide how the party learned 
about Khundrukar. Pick one of the following options 
that suits your campaign, or make up an explanation. 
FOLLOW THE MAP 
The party has acquired a map showing the location of 
a secret dwarven stronghold named Khundrukar. Per­
haps the characters discovered the map and other lore 
about the place during a previous adventure, or it turned 
up in a forgotten corner of a library. Tales attributed to a 
previous, failed expedition make reference to a hoard of 
wondrous arms and armor. 
PLACING THE ADVENTURE 
Any setting that includes a mountainous region has a 
ready-to-use location for the dwarven stronghold in The 
Forge of Fury. 
Dragonlance. On Krynn, Khundrukar can be placed 
anywhere in the Kharolis Mountains. An independent 
stronghold that has no direct tunnels connecting it to 
Thorbardin, it was overrun by attackers during the Age of 
Might. During the Age of Despair, it was seized by High­
lord Verminaard's forces. Consider replacing the ores in 
the adventure with hobgoblins and the duergar with Thei­
war dwarves. 
Eberron. Once an outpost in the western Mror Holds, 
Khundrukar was besieged and cleared of its inhabitants 
when the Kingdom of Galifar invaded that land. The 
aggressors left the place unoccupied after their victory. 
Since then, it has fallen into the hands of various groups 
of monsters. 
Forgotten Realms. Located northwest of Mirabar in 
the Spine of the World, Khundrukar was a shield dwarf 
stronghold that became overrun by renegade ores from the 
Many-Arrows tribe, unhappy with what they saw as their 
kingdom's betrayal of the old ways. 
Creyhawk. Khundrukar stands in the Pomarj, in the 
western Drachensgrab Hills. The fortress fell shortly after 
the Hateful Wars, when a wave of ores and other evil hu­
manoid invaders swept over the region. 
CHAPTER 2 I THE FORGE OF FURY 
33 

--- PAGE 35 ---

34 TRACK THE BROKEN BLADE 
Baron Althon, a local noble, hires the party to search 
for the legendary cache of weapons forged by Durged­
din the smith. He shows the characters a broken blade 
bearing the smith's mark, and tells them that it was dis­
covered near a rocky hill called the Stone Tooth. Baron 
Althon provides directions and promises to reward the 
characters richly for each of Durgeddin's blades they 
recover. He will pay the characters 20 gp each just for 
bringing back information about the dwarven complex, 
and an additional 100 gp if they provide detailed maps. 
VANQUISH THE 0RC RAIDERS 
In the mining town of Blasingdell, the characters learn 
that ore raiders have been pillaging isolated farmsteads 
and camps in the hills north of the town. The local mili­
tia captured an ore warrior left for dead by its comrades 
THE MINING TOWN OF BLASINGDELL 
Blasingdell lies about 30 miles south of the Stone Tooth, 
a journey of three days on foot or two days on horseback 
due to the surrounding rugged terrain and dense forests. 
Although it isn't close enough for the characters to use 
as an overnight rest stop while they explore Khundrukar, 
Blasingdell is still useful as a place to purchase equip­
ment, stock up on supplies, and train between excursions 
into the caverns. 
The town's population of around 2,000 is quite diverse; 
although humans are the largest group, almost any player 
character race can be found here. 
The town's mayor is Sir Miles Berrick (male hu­
man noble). 
Sergeant Grendar Kuln (male half-ore veteran) is in 
charge of the town watch; Constable Dara Whitewood (fe­
male human veteran) is the senior officer. The town watch 
consists of two full-time guards in addition to its officers. 
A militia force of around l 00 commoners can be mustered 
in emergencies . 
Kheldegan Tolm (male dwarf commoner) owns Tolm's 
Superior Outfitting and Dry Goods. 
Sarel Bankdown (female half-elf commoner) is the pro­
prietor of the Griffon's Nest inn and tavern. 
Sister Alonsa (female human priest) heads up the town's 
small temple (its primary deity is left to you). Sister Alonsa 
is assisted in her duties by two acolytes . 
• 
ABOUT THE ORIGINAL and brought it back for questioning. Under the influence 
of a charm person spell, the ore divulged the location of 
the monsters' lair, a lonely hill called the Stone Tooth. 
The mayor offers a bounty of 25 gp per ore, dead or 
alive, and the gratitude of the townsfolk to any who can 
permanently end the threat. 
APPROACHING 
KHUNDRUKAR 
At the start of play, the characters are trekking through 
the wilderness and have just reached the outskirts of 
Blasingdell (or some other community), When you're 
ready to begin, read: 
Durgeddin was a master smith who forged blades of sur­
passing quality and power. Centuries ago, his home was 
sacked by ores. Durgeddin led the remnants of his clan 
to the mountains north of the town of Blasingdell and 
established a small, secret stronghold somewhere in the 
trackless wilderness. 
From his hidden redoubt, he waged a decades-long 
vendetta against all ore-kind, until his enemies dis­
covered his fortress and attacked it after a long siege. 
Durgeddin and his followers perished, and much wealth 
was carried away by the conquering hordes. But it's said 
that the deepest and best-hidden vaults and armories es­
caped the looting, and that some of Durgeddin's extraor­
dinary blades still wait in the darkness for a hand bold 
enough to claim one. 
You've come to Blasingdell, a small mining town on 
the northern frontier, to see if there's anything to these 
stories. Your map shows that the old dwarf-hold lies 
about three days' march to the north of the town. Dark, 
deeply forested hills rise beyond the town's outskirts 
The characters can spend time interacting with the 
townsfolk, gathering equipment and provisions, and oth­
erwise preparing before they set out. 
The Forge of Fury, by Richard Baker, 
was originally published in 2000 as 
an adventure for the third edition of 
the D&D game. 
The adventure was published 
shortly after The Sunless Citadel and was designed as a follow-up to it. 
Characters who succeeded in that 
mission and advanced to 3rd level 
were now ready to take on the chal­
lenges of a ruined dwarven fortress. 
CHAPTER 2 I THE FORGE OF FURY 

--- PAGE 36 ---

THE STONE TOOTH 
When the characters set forth on their journey. read: 
• 
• As you travel north from the mining town of Blasingdell, 
you pass through brooding pine forests and deep vales. 
From where you stand now, you catch sight of a tall, 
steep hill that rises to a prominent bare knob of rock­
the Stone Tooth. A thin spire of smoke rises from some 
unseen point high on the hill's slopes, and you can make 
out a steep, narrow road or track that runs back and forth 
across the face of the mountainside . 
Refer to map 2.1. The characters have several options: 
follow the path, scout the area, or wait and watch. 
FOLLOW THE PATH 
At the foot of the Stone Tooth, a carefully constructed 
path winds up the hillside to some unseen height above. 
Durgeddin's clan concealed its presence as much as 
possible, but years of wind and rain have eroded away 
its cover, leaving the path exposed and visible from the 
valley floor below. 
The path climbs to the Mountain Door, at the location 
marked A on the map. This is the route used by the ores 
in Great Ulfe's tribe to come and go from their lair. 
If someone checks the path for tracks, a successful 
DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check reveals that four booted 
humanoids came down it within the last day and headed 
into the forest. The trail joins older tracks in the woods 
and becomes indistinguishable after about half a mile. 
These tracks belong to ore foraging parties; see "Wait 
and Watch," page 36, for more information. 
SCOUT THE AREA 
Ambitious characters might choose to ignore the path 
and scale the Stone Tooth's slopes. The going is very 
hard, with steep slopes and heavy undergrowth, reduc­
ing the characters' travel pace to roughly 100 feet per 
minute. Thoroughly exploring the hillside could easily 
take hours. 
Heavy woods block the view upslope, making it dif­
ficult to ascertain the origin of the smoke (a natural 
chimney). Have the party's guide make a DC 10 Wisdom 
'Survival) check when the group first enters the hillside. 
On a successful check, the characters travel in the gen­
eral direction of the chimney. Otherwise , they lose their 
way (see "Becoming Lost" in chapter 5 of the Dungeon 
.Waster's Guide). 
(A) The Mountain Door. This is the front entrance to 
the Glitterhame. The old dwarf-path leads up to a bare 
shoulder of rock and then turns into a deep cleft in the 
hillside. If the characters enter this way, the expedition 
begins in area 1 of map 2.2, the Mountain Door. 
(B) Chimney. When the character s reach the area 
marked B on the map, they can discover the source of 
the smoke. A natural rock chimney leads down into the 
caverns below, and a thin stream of smoke rises through 
it. The smoke spreads out and isn't easy to pinpoint in 
the rugged terrain. THE STONE TOOTH 
50 100 yards 
MAP 2.1: THE STONE TOOTH 
A character who searches for the source of the smoke 
finds the rock chimney with a successful DC 10 Wis­
dom (Perception) check. If the characters pass nearby 
without searching , anyone who has a passive Perception 
score of 15 or higher notices the fissure. 
If the characters descend the chimney, the expedition 
begins in area 7 of map 2.2, the Mountain Door. 
(C) Ore Tunnel. On the other side of the Stone Tooth, 
a few hundred yards from the Mountain Door, the ore 
army burrowed into the hillside to circumvent the dwar­
ven defenses . The tunnel is still passable, but its en­
trance is choked with brush and debris. If the characters 
enter this area, someone who has a passive Perception 
score of 15 or higher discovers the ore tunnel. The char­
acters locate the tunnel automatically if anyone searches 
the area; it leads to area 21 of map 2.3, the Glitterhame. 
The tunnel entrance is about 6 feet high and 4 feet 
wide. Anyone who succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Sur-
WILDERNESS ENCOUNTERS AND CAMPI NC 
If you want to make the trek from Blasingdell to the Stone 
Tooth more interesting, you can create random encounters 
with ore raiding parties (see "Wait and Watch," page 36) 
or with creatures native to forest or hills. See appendix 
B of the Dungeon Master's Guide for lists of monsters by 
environment. 
The characters might be forced to retreat outside the 
stronghold to recuperate after difficult battles. The party 
can readily find defensible campsites in the forest near the 
Stone Tooth. 
CHAPTER 2 I THE FORGE OF FURY 35 

--- PAGE 37 ---

viva!) check can spot old tracks passing in and out of 
the tunnel-reptilian footprints (from the troglodytes 
inhabiting the Glitterhame) and the paw prints of a very 
large bear. 
(D) Hilltop. An hour or two of hard hiking brings the 
party to the summit. The Stone Tooth is about 1,450 feet 
in height, towering over the neighboring hills by 500 
feet or more. The last 100 feet or so are a sheer point 
of rock, requiring DC 15 Strength (Athletics) checks 
to climb successfully. The view is spectacular, but the 
hilltop is otherwise unremarkable. (No entrance to the 
fortress is to be found here.) 
(E) The Dark Mere. The eastern slopes of the Stone 
Tooth descend into a damp valley where water is 
trapped by the terrain. A dark tarn pools under the hill's 
slopes, surrounded by numerous smaller lakes. A hid­
den drainage channel deep underwater connects to the 
subterranean Black Lake, providing access to Nights­
cale's underground lair. 
The opening is about 40 feet down, and it lies about 
100 feet from the western lakeshore. Player characters 
exploring around the lake can't find this outlet unless 
they conduct extensive dives to plumb the mere's depths, 
requiring DC 10 Strength (Athletics) checks to swim 
underwater. If any characters are capable of staying this 
deep without suffocating and conduct a thorough search 
of the lake, they discover the passage with a successful 
DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check. If the characters en­
ter through this watery passage, they emerge in area 54 
of map 2.6, the Black Lake. 
WAIT AND WATCH 
The characters might choose to observe the path for 
some time before braving the Stone Tooth. When they 
arrive, two foraging parties from Great Ulfe's tribe are 
searching the nearby hills for loot. The first party of four 
ores returns two days after the characters arrive, and 
the second group three days after that. These ores sleep 
by day and travel by night, so they arrive in the party's 
vicinity just before dawn. 
If the party sets up camp at least 90 feet from the path 
and doesn't take any action that might draw attention, 
the returning ores pass by without spotting the camp­
site. Otherwise, the ores notice the camp when they 
KHUNDRUKAR: GENERAL FEATURES 
The following aspects of Khundrukar are true unless other­
wise noted in a particular area description. 
Doors. Most doors are made of wood or stone. Charac­
ters can attempt various tasks before trying to open a door, 
including listening for sounds from the other side and 
checking for traps. If characters elect to listen at a door, 
check the description of the room beyond to determine 
if any creatures inhabit that area. If no instructions are 
otherwise provided, a character who listens at a door and 
succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check can hear 
sounds of activity through the door; increase the DC to 15 
for quieter sounds. 
Light. Within the confines of Khundrukar, all areas are 
dark unless a room's description says otherwise . 
Ventilation. All keyed areas contain an adequate air 
supply. The air is renewed through vents that lead to the 
surface. These vents are individually too small for any but 
Tiny creatures to navigate. 
CHAPTER 2 I THE FORGE OF FURY come within 90 feet (or within twice as far if a campfire 
is burning or the party isn't attempting to be quiet). 
A lookout whose post overlooks the trail and who has 
a passive Perception score of 10 or higher detects the 
ores as they approach. The ores aren't likely to notice 
a hidden lookout; compare their passive Perception 
scores to the character's Dexterity (Stealth) check. 
Four hunched humanoids in dirty hide armor approach 
along the trail, snarling and muttering to each other in a 
guttural tongue. Yellow tusks jut from their bestial faces. 
If the ores come across the camp and aren't spotted, 
they attempt to take out anyone on watch or creep into 
the camp to attack sleeping characters. 
If an ore party moves past the characters unchal­
lenged or fights its way through, the survivors reinforce 
the defenses in the complex (see area 5 and area 14). 
Captured ores can describe in some detail the general 
arrangement of the Mountain Door. They don't know 
anything about the rest of the complex, or that it's pos­
sible to enter through the chimney. The ores defending 
the Mountain Door refuse to negotiate for their return. 
The characters might disguise themselves as ores 
using captured gear. Doing so can let them try to bluff 
their way past sentries in the dungeon, using Charisma 
(Deception) checks contested by the ores' Wisdom (In­
sight) checks. 
Treasure. Each ore carries a sack of mundane sup­
plies looted from the countryside, as well as coinage 
totaling 4d6 sp and ld4 gp. 
Development. No more dungeon denizens emerge 
from the dungeon during this time, and no more ores 
leave for a week after the second patrol returns. 
THE FORGE OF FURY 
Once the party enters Khundrukar, start at the appropri­
ate area on map 2.2, the Mountain Door, or map 2.3, the 
Glitterhame. 
THE MOUNTAIN DOOR 
The uppermost level of Khundrukar, called the Moun­
tain Door, is a natural cavern that was expanded and im­
proved upon by Durgeddin's folk, who created a series 
of halls and guard chambers that protect the entrance 
to their realm. The place is still well fortified, even 
to this day. 
This former dwarven strongpoint is now occupied by 
a band of ore raiders, led by a fierce ogre who calls him­
self Great Ulfe. These raiders emerge from the Moun­
tain Door to hunt and pillage in the surrounding area. 
To keep their lair secure, the ores have blocked access 
to the lower levels of Khundrukar, and they rarely en­
counter the other denizens of the cave system. 
The following locations are identified on map 2.2. 
1. END OF THE TRAIL 
The old dwarven path ascends to a cleft in the hillside 
and ends at the front door of Khundrukar. 

--- PAGE 38 ---

MAP 2.2: T><E MOUNTAIN DooR 
• 
The path climbs up one last steep switchback toward a 
bare shoulder of rock. The hillside rises steeply on your 
right and drops away precipitously on your left. Debris 
and rubbish lie scattered over the last hundred yards or 
so-discarded water skins, bits of charred bone, and 
splintered casks or kegs. Up ahead, the path opens onto 
a wide ledge and then doubles back sharply into the 
mountainside. 
Two bestial humanoids in hide armor stand watch on 
the ledge. They appear inattentive and bored. 
Creatures. Two ores stand guard along the northern 
edge of the ledge, though they aren't paying as much 
attention to their duties as they should. The characters 
or their advance scout) can spot them from as far as 60 
feet away. The sentries, Wark and Thark, are grumbling 
in the Ore language about someone named Ulfe. Apply a 
-2 penalty to the ores' passive Perception scores. 
Arrow Slits. When the characters move around the 
corner into the eastern part of the ledge, they might dis­
cover a row of hidden arrow slits in the rocky wall to the 
east about 15 feet above the floor. By examining the wall 
and making a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) 
check, a character notices the slits. 
Developments. If they are attacked or confronted 
by more than one character, Wark and Thark call out 
a warning that's heard by the ore in area 4 and then 
attempt to flee to area 3. See the "Mountain Door De­
fenses" sidebar. 
If the archers are alerted to the party's presence , they 
open fire on intruders on the ledge and in area 2. See 
area 4 for more information. 
2. THE DWARF-DOOR 
:\1oving eastward from the ledge, the trail turns south 
and rises steeply through a cleft in the rock toward a 
grand entrance. Shallow steps lead up through a steep fissure to the 
south and turn east into the mountainside. Here, a broad 
entranceway has been carved out of the stone. Marble 
steps cracked with age and veined with green moss lead 
up to a strong double door of carved stone, eight feet 
wide and almost ten feet tall. Arrow slits high on the 
north and south walls command this area. 
If the characters quietly dealt with the ores in area 1 
using stealth or disguise, the door is open. Otherwise, 
the ores have been alerted to intruders, and the door 
is shut and barred from the inside. Forcing open the 
barred door is very difficult, requiring a successful DC 
20 Strength check. 
MOUNTAIN DOOR DEFENSES 
The ores are well prepared for a frontal assault on the 
Mountain Door. They follow the sequence of activity de­
scribed below to the best of their ability unless prevented 
or interrupted by the player characters . 
Round 1. After sounding the alarm, the sentries in areal 
(Wark and Thark) flee south to area 2. 
Round 2. The ores in area 4 fire at any exposed char­
acters in area l if they have been alerted by the sentries. 
Wark and Thark flee through the door into area 3. 
Round 3. Wark and Thark cross the rope bridge in area 3. 
The ores in area 4 continue to fire at characters in areas l 
and 2. One ore from area 4 moves through the secret door 
leading to area 3, intending to close and bar the double 
doors leading to area 2. 
Round 4. Wark and Thark slip through to area 5 to 
spread the alarm, alerting the ores in areas 11 and 14. 
Round 5. The ore that shut the double doors in area 3 
moves to area 4 or 4a while the other archers continue to 
fire at exposed characters. The ores in the eastern half of 
area 3 cut the rope bridge and prepare to defend the doors 
that lead to area 5. 
Round 8. The ores in area 14 arrive in area 5. 
Round 12. Great Ulfe and the ores from area 11 move to 
area 5 to ready a counterattack. 
CHAPTER 2 I THE FORGE OF FURY 37 

--- PAGE 39 ---

Creatures. If the ores have been alerted, the ores in 
areas 4 and 4a fire arrows until the characters either 
retreat or succeed in bypassing the door. 
Development. If the characters are repelled, they 
must deal with additional reinforcements if they try this 
approach again. Two ores from area 11 stand watch at 
the doors on the west side of area 3, while the ore Eye of 
Gruumsh from area 9 backs up the ores in area 4 or 4a. 
3. THE RIFT HALL 
The great door opens into a large hall. A narrow ledge 
overlooks a deep, dark crevasse that cuts the room in 
two. A dangerous-looking rope bridge, frayed and thin, 
spans the gap. Water gurgles and rushes somewhere 
far below. Two copper braziers burn brightly on either 
side of the door, illuminating the western half of the 
room. Another ledge is barely visible on the other side of 
the chasm. 
The hall beyond the doors, and the great crevasse that 
runs through it, once served as the last line of defense 
for Khundrukar's dwarves. 
Creatures. Two ores guard the eastern side of the 
room. They do everything in their power to prevent the 
characters from getting across the bridge. If any of the 
party members have darkvision or a means of illuminat­
ing the far side, read: 
CHAPTER 2 I THE FORGE OF FURY Two brutish humanoids stand watch on the other side of 
the crevasse. They snarl a challenge, revealing yellowed 
tusks, and prepare to hurl javelins at you! 
Rope Bridge. The bridge is safe structurally, despite 
its appearance. Crossing under fire is difficult enough 
to require DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks. On a 
successful check, a character can move at half speed. 
On a failed check, a character makes no progress. If the 
check fails by 5 or more, the character must make a DC 
10 Strength or Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, 
the character plummets almost 200 feet to the under­
ground river below and is swept away. The characters 
can prevent falls by roping themselves to a stable attach­
ment point before crossing. 
Secret Doors. Two secret doors on the north and 
south walls lead to areas 4 and 4a. The doors are well 
made, each requiring a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Per­
ception) check to discover. A door can be opened by 
simultaneously pushing in two concealed stone plates 
in the wall about 1 foot above it. The plates can be found 
with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. 
Developments. The ores use the rock outcroppings 
on their side for shelter from attacks, gaining half cover. 
They throw their javelins at characters trying to cross 
the bridge, or at those who hang back to cast spells or 
make ranged attacks. A character on the bridge who is 
hit by an attack must make a saving throw to avoid a fall, 
just as if the character's Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to 
move along the bridge had failed by 5 or more. 

--- PAGE 40 ---

If an intruder gets at least two-thirds of the way across 
the bridge, one ore breaks cover to move through the 
double doors into area 5 and get help. The other trie to 
hinder the characters by chopping at the bridge·s sup­
port ropes with its greataxe. Each rope has hit points 
and AC 11. If one support rope is cut, the DC of the Dex· 
terity (Acrobatics) check to cross the bridge increases 
to 12, and characters on the bridge must immediatel y 
make a saving throw to avoid falling as described above. 
If both ropes are cut, the east end of the bridge drops 
into the crevasse and slams into the cliff wall on the 
west side. Any characters on the bridge take 7 (2d6) 
bludgeoning damage from the impact with the wall and 
must make successful DC 12 Strength or Dexterity sav­
ing throws to avoid losing their grip and falling if they 
aren't otherwise secured. 
Development. If the ores destroy the bridge but repel 
the invaders in doing so, Great Ulfe's followers rebuild it 
within three days. Any ores killed here are replaced by 
ores from area 11. 
4 AND 4A. ARCHERS' STATIONS 
The dwarves carved out chambers on either side of the 
entryway so they could rain arrows down on attackers 
that approached the front door of their stronghold. The 
arrow slits are 15 feet or more above the floor of areas 1 
and 2 and are impassible for creatures larger than Tiny. 
They grant three-quarters cover to the ores stationed 
behind them. 
The secret doors in area 3 provide access to these 
locations. 
The door slides aside to reveal a narrow passage that de­
scends a flight of stairs into a small chamber. Light from 
outside slants into the room through a series of narrow 
embrasures. 
The area is littered with well-gnawed bones, cobwebs, 
and rat droppings . Poorly cured hide blankets are care· 
lessly scattered over the floor. 
Secret Door. In the north end of area 4, a secret door 
connects to area 14. A character can find the door by 
succeeding on a DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) check. The 
ores are unaware of this passage and don't use it. 
Creatures. Four ores, three in area 4 and one in area 
4a, overlook the stairs leading up to area 2. These ores 
aren't particularly vigilant, but they do start shooting if 
the sentries in area 1 call for help. The ores are armed 
with longbows instead of javelins: +3 to hit (range 
150/600 ft.); 5 (ld8 + 1) piercing damage on a hit. 
When the characters turn the corner into area 2, 
the archer in area 4a joins the attack while one of the 
archers from area 4 circles around through the secret 
door in an attempt to shut the double doors to area 3 
(see "Mountain Door Defenses," page 37). 
If the heroes attack by coming through the secret 
doors that lead to these areas, the archers fire at charac­
ters descending the stairs, then switch to greataxes and 
move up to block the stairways . Development. If the characters dispose of the sen­
tries in area 1 quietly, the ores in area 4 might not notice 
them. Characters can attempt to sneak past the row 
of arrow slits by comparing their Dexterity (Stealth) 
checks to the ores' passive Perception scores. If the 
characters successfully sneak past the sentries, they 
reach area 2 without alerting the archers. 
If the characters defeat these ores but withdraw from 
the dungeon before overcoming the rest of them, the ar­
chers are replaced by ores from area 14 and reinforced 
by the ore eye of Gruumsh from area 9. 
5. 0RC CAVE 
The walls and floor of this natural cave have been care­
fully smoothed . You can discern at least four routes 
leading off into darkness . Red coals glow from within 
the southeastern passageway, and a crude wooden cage 
door closes off the southern exit. The floor is covered 
with sleeping furs, crates, sacks, and rubbish. 
The second ore raiding party normally lairs in the open 
area east of the doors. These ores are currently out of 
the dungeon unless the party spent several days ob­
serving the hillside (see "Wait and Watch," page 36) 
before entering. 
Cage Door. The cage door to the south leads to area 
6, where two prisoners languish under the ores' indif­
ferent care. The prisoners leap to their feet and rush to 
the cage door to cry for help when the characters en­
ter area 5. 
Treasure. The crates and sacks in this room contain 
mundane supplies looted from the countryside -flour, 
grain, nails, and so on. The total value is about 20 gp 
for about 500 pounds of material. Additionally, if char­
acters are held captive in area 6, their equipment is 
stored here. 
Development. When the second ore raiding party 
returns (five days after the characters arrive at the Stone 
Tooth), they take up residence here. Add four ores to this 
room after their return. 
6. PRISONER CAVE 
The ores occasionally capture miners, settlers, and mer­
chants traveling through the forests north of Blasing­
dell. They keep their captives in a small pen until they 
put them to death or ransom them. 
A row of rough-hewn sapling trunks forms a crude but 
serviceable barrier across the mouth of this small cave. 
A door locked with an iron padlock secures the room. 
Inside, you see two filthy prisoners dressed in tattered 
rags, crowding close to the door. "Thank Yondalla!" one 
cries out. "We're rescued!" 
Creatures. The prisoners are a pair of human com­
moners named Geradil and Courana. They hail from a 
small settlement a few miles from Blasingdell, and the 
CHAPTER 2 I THE FORGE OF FURY 39 

--- PAGE 41 ---

ores have held them captive for almost a month now. 
Neither one's family could raise the ransom demanded 
by their captors, so both await a terrible death at the 
ores' hands. 
Opening the cage door requires a successful DC 12 
Dexterity check using thieves' tools, the key from Old 
Yarrack's pocket (see area 14), or a sharp axe and a little 
time. (The padlock has AC 19 and 5 hit points.) Geradil 
and Courana are extremely grateful for their rescue, but 
they will not join the characters in their quest-neither 
is skilled at fighting, and they just want to go home. 
Treasure. The characters can free the prisoners and 
escort them back to their homes (about a day's travel 
away). The grateful families reward them with two 
potions of healing. Taking the time to see Geradil and 
Courana to safety, however, gives the ores a chance to 
prepare for the next assault. 
Development. Any characters captured by the ores 
eventually wind up in the cage, unless they demonstrate 
that they're too much trouble to be left alive. Their gear 
is stored among the other supplies in area 5. New char­
acters joining the party might also be introduced as pris­
oners here. 
7. FIRE IN THE HOLE 
The irregular chamber southeast of the main cave holds 
the main cooking fire of the tribe. A crevice in its ceiling 
winds up through the rock to the natural chimney on the 
hilltop above (see "The Stone Tooth," page 35). 
A large, smoky fire crackles in the center of this room. 
Battered pots and kettles are stacked all over; clearly, 
this space serves as a crude kitchen. You feel a distinct 
draft drawing the smoke up through a rough hole in the 
ceiling. 
The characters might attempt to descend into the area 
through the chimney. The shaft is about 80 feet long; 
its walls are irregular and rough but slippery, requiring 
successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) checks to climb. 
Anchoring a rope at the top of the shaft reduces the 
check DC to 5. A careful climber can easily avoid the fire 
on the way down. 
If a character's check fails by 5 or more, the character 
must succeed on a DC 10 Strength saving throw or fall 
the rest of the way down the chimney. In addition to 
falling damage, the character takes an extra 3 (ld6) fire 
damage from the hot coals and makes enough noise to 
alert any ores in area 5. 
8. 0RC COMMONS 
Haphazard stacks of crates, barrels, sacks, and bundles 
crowd this long cavern. To the north, two finished stone 
passageways open to the east and west; a narrower open­
ing leads south. In the southeast corner is an old well full 
of murky water. 
CHAPTER 2 I THE FORGE OF FURY The cavern is full of plunder from the ores' raids 
through the surrounding area: foodstuffs, ale, blankets, 
tools, timber, pitch, nails, wool, and similar goods. 
Iron Gate. The passage leading east is blocked about 
10 feet in by tightly packed crates and sacks of flour. 
Removing this material allows travel for another 20 feet 
to the east, where the tunnel ends at an iron gate stuffed 
with blankets and straw pallets. The ores created 
these barricades to prevent the stirges in area 10 from 
getting out. 
The iron gate's lock is rusted shut; it can be picked 
with a successful DC 12 Dexterity check by a character 
using thieves' tools or forced open with a successful DC 
15 Strength check. 
Secret Doors. The passage to the south branches 
in a Y shape. The southwest branch connects to area 
5, and the southeast one leads to a secret door cleverly 
constructed to blend into the natural rock of the cave. A 
character who makes a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Per­
ception) check discovers the door. 
On the other side, a worked passage continues up to 
what appears to be a blank wall, marked with hexes and 
curses in Ore. The markings conceal another secret 
door, which requires a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Per­
ception) check to find. 
Treasure. The mundane supplies have a total value of 
about 20 gp for about 500 pounds of material. 
With a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check, 
a character finds a loose stone. Behind it is hidden a 
small locked strongbox containing 180 gp and a flask of 
holy water. This is the personal treasure of Old Yarrack 
(see area 11). 
9. SHAMAN'S LAIR 
The secret door pivots open to reveal a chamber of 
finished stonework. The room is cluttered with crude 
furnishings, and the air is hazy with the smoke of a small 
cooking fire. Dozens of yellowed skulls are suspended 
from the ceiling by fraying ropes strung through holes 
punched in the bone. An ore in a ragged black robe 
looks up from her work, her face twisted in an expres­
sion of rage. 
Creatures. Burdug the shaman, an ore Eye of 
Gruumsh , has commandeered a chamber as her private 
domain. She lives here with her two followers, female 
ores, separate from the rest of the tribe. 
The door to area 10 is locked, but the key is inserted 
in the keyhole on this side. Burdug keeps the door 
closed because she wants to confine the stirges on the 
other side. (She calls the stirges her "little stingies" 
and occasionally captures one to use in her potions 
and brews.) 
Burdug orders her two followers to engage intruders 
while she attempts to neutralize a dangerous-looking 
combatant with a command spell. Then she casts bless 
on herself and the others, and finally casts spiritual 
weapon before joining battle. 

--- PAGE 42 ---

If the fight goes poorly, Burdug throws alchem· ·s 
fire (she has three flasks) and opens the door o area 10. 
releasing the stirges. She takes advantag e of the confu­
ion, using more alchemist's fire if necessary. to escape 
and seek help. 
Treasure. A character who makes a successful DC 
10 Wisdom (Perception) check finds two leather sacks 
among the clutter, each containing 160 sp. If Burdug 
is defeated, the characters can recover any of her three 
flasks of alchemist's fire that weren't used. 
Secret Exit. A successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) 
check is required to find the secret door on the west 
vall. It connects to the passage leading toward area 8; 
the secret door farther along the passage to the west 
i n't concealed from this side. 
10. THE GRAND STAIR 
• 
• The ceiling soars thirty feet high in the center of this im­
pressive chamber, and the walls are carved with images 
of dwarves at their forges. Two large stone doors exit to 
the north and south. Several old skeletons lie scattered 
near the northern door. A gate of wrought iron stands in 
the western wall. 
In the center of the floor, a natural rift descends 
sharply. Dozens of stone steps lead down into darkness . 
You can hear the distant sound of running water and a 
curious buzzing coming from far below. 
The easternmost chamber in the Mountain Door com­
plex formerly served as the main entrance to the Glitter­
hame, which occupies the great natural caverns deeper 
in the hillside. 
Creatures. If the characters aren't trying to be quiet, 
four hungry stirges attack. 
• The buzzing grows louder, and then four things resem­
bling insectoid bats emerge from the stairwell and fly 
toward you! I 
Large quantities of smoke discourage the stirges, and 
they don't move closer than 5 feet from a source of fire 
including characters set alight by the trap described be­
low). Sated stirges flap off to digest their meal down in 
area 15a of the Glitterhame. 
The iron gate blocks entry from area 8 (see it for more 
information). The stairs in the rift lead down to the 
northwest end of area 15 in the Glitterhame . 
The door to the south connects to area 9 and is locked 
from the other side. The lock can be picked from this 
side by someone who makes a successful DC 10 Dex­
terity check using thieves' tools, but doing so pushes the 
key out on the other side and warns Burdug the shaman 
that someone 's coming. 
Fire Trap. The door to the north is carved in the im­
age of a glowering dwarf's face. Hinges are visible. On 
either side of the door, eight small spouts are carefully 
worked into the stonework about 10 feet above the floor. The skeletons near the door are those of ores killed 
by the trap long ago; their remains show signs of severe 
scorching. Rusted axe heads lie near the bodies, with no 
sign of the weapons' hafts. 
If the door is pulled open before the trap is disabled, a 
counterweight drops and pumps a flammable substance 
resembling alchemist's fire from the spouts. Each crea­
ture within 15 feet of the door takes 10 (4d4) fire dam­
age, or half damage with a successful DC 10 Dexterity 
saving throw. At the start of each of its turns thereafter, 
an affected creature takes 5 (2d4) fire damage. A crea­
ture can fight the flames around itself by making a suc­
cessful DC 10 Dexterity check as an action; a successful 
check reduces the fire damage it takes at the start of 
each of its turns to 2 (ld4). Making another success-
ful Dexterity check as an action quenches the flames 
around the creature entirely. 
After the door is opened, the counterweight pulls it 
shut again in 2 rounds, resetting the trap. The charac­
ters can prevent this from happening by jamming the 
door open. If the trap resets, it can be activated only 
once more before its fiery substance is depleted. 
The spouts on the wall can be detected by someone 
who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. 
With a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) 
check afterward , a character deduces that they form 
part of a trap mechanism. A character who makes a 
successful DC 12 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, 
or someone who tightly plugs the holes with durable 
material, renders the trap inactive. Someone who suc­
ceeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check 
while examining the door identifies the counterweight 
mechanism that activates the trap; it can be deactivated 
afterward by someone who makes a successful DC 10 
Dexterity check using thieves' tools. 
Development. Inspecting the small room behind the 
door reveals the full extent of the trap's counterweight 
mechanism , as well as a system of pipes that connect 
the spouts to two 20-gallon copper drums (containing 
the substance for the fire trap). 
A character who is proficient in the use of alchemist's 
supplies might be able to craft alchemist's fire from the 
dregs of the tanks. Doing so requires a successful DC 
15 Intelligen ce check after the character finishes a long 
rest. On a successful check, the character salvages ld4 
flasks of alchemist's fire. On a failed check, the reagents 
are mixed improperly, spoiling the batch; no further 
attempt to use these reagents can be made. If the check 
fails by 5 or more, the character is affected as though hit 
by alchemist's fire. 
11. 0RC QUARTERS 
Barrels, crates, and sacks line the walls of this chamber. 
Among the loot, four oversized straw pallets and other 
simple furnishings show that it now serves as a bunk 
room. Four bestial humanoids with feral eyes are clean­
ing their weapons and mending their gear; they spring to 
their feet and roar in challenge . 
CHAPTER 2 I THE FORGE OF FURY 41 

--- PAGE 43 ---

42 Creatures. Four ores live in an old guardroom. These 
ores fight dirty. They team up into pairs, each focus-
ing on one character. One ore in the pair attempts to 
shove the character, then the other attacks, hoping for a 
prone target. 
Treasure. The supplies stockpiled here are the same 
as those in areas 5 and 8: trade goods and staples 
raided from travelers and nearby settlements . 
The ores have 210 gp stashed in an old iron cauldron 
under vermin-infested bedding. A small pouch in an­
other ore's bedding contains a topaz worth 200 gp and 
two onyx stones worth 50 gp each. This loot isn't well 
hidden; anyone searching the room can uncover it. 
Development. If the characters leave the complex 
before they have defeated Great Ulfe, two of these ores 
move to reinforce area 2 (reducing the number in this 
room to two) before the characters return. 
12. GREAT ULFE 
A short flight of stairs leads up to a large, iron-bound 
door. A bloodstained human skull is fixed to the center of 
the door by an iron spike. 
The door isn't locked, but it is heavy and hard to 
move; a successful DC 17 Strength check is needed to 
force it open. 
Beyond the door lies a small chamber covered in poorly 
cured animal hides and illuminated by smoking torches 
in bronze sconces. The smell is indescribable. Amon­
strous creature about ten feet in height steps forward, a 
massive axe in one hand. Two huge wolves strain at 
CHAPTER 2 I THE FORGE OF FURY chains held closely in its other hand. "You think to 
challenge the Great Ulfe?" the creature booms. "Vak! 
Thrag! At them!" 
It drops the chains and, as the wolves spring forward, 
it charges at you with a roar of rage. 
Creatures. Great Ulfe is a fierce ogre who leads the 
ores of the Mountain Door. The chamber he claims as 
his own once belonged to the dwarf watch-captain. 
If the characters fail to open the door on the first 
attempt, Great Ulfe is alerted to their presence. He re­
leases his two dire wolves, Vak and Thrag, and takes 
the Ready action to attack the first enemy who enters the 
room. He is armed with a greataxe instead of a great­
club: +6 to hit; 17 (2d12 + 4) slashing damage on a hit. 
Great Ulfe neither asks nor gives quarter, but if the 
ogre falls, the wolves attempt to flee. 
Development. If the characters defeat Great Ulfe but 
leave any ores alive, one of the surviving ores claims 
leadership of the tribe. If at least half the ores in the 
tribe are slain in addition to Ulfe, any survivors abandon 
the dungeon after the party leaves. They become roving 
bands of raiders that the adventurers might have to deal 
with later. 
Treasure. Great Ulfe keeps his hoard in two large 
wooden chests against the south wall: 440 gp, 1,600 sp, 
a potion of climbing, and a +l rapier. (The ogre would 
never stoop to wielding the delicate blade like some 
prancing bard.) 
13. DWARVEN STATUE 
At the end of the passage stands a statue of a fierce-look­
ing dwarf in heavy mail armor. The stone warrior holds 
a sword in one hand and a smith's hammer in the other. 
The statue is about seven feet tall and stands on a large 
stone pedestal. 
The statue is part of another trap designed to thwart 
invaders of the citadel. All the denizens of the Mountain 
Door know about the trap and avoid triggering it. 
If any character approaches within 5 feet of the statue 
without disarming the trap, read: 
Suddenly, you feel a small click from the floor beneath 
your feet. The statue's bearded face slides open, like an 
oversized nutcracker, and greenish gas billows forth. 
Poison Gas Trap. A pressure plate is set into the 
floor about 5 feet in front of the statue. When at least 20 
pounds of weight is placed on the pressure plate, it de­
presses into the floor, opening the statue's face to reveal 
a nozzle from which poison gas sprays out in a 15-foot 
cone. Each affected creature must succeed on a DC 12 
Constitution saving throw or become poisoned until the 
creature finishes a short rest. 

--- PAGE 44 ---

Someone who examines the proper loca ion and suc­
ceeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception chec • notices 
the pressure plate. A successful DC 12 Dexterity check 
by a character using thieves' tools disarm the trap: the 
pressure plate can also be deactivated by phy ically jam­
ming it so that it can't move. 
If the trap isn't deactivated, it resets automatically af­
ter 1 minute. 
14. BUNK ROOM 
A large chamber , once the principal bunk room for 
dwarf guards posted in this part of the dungeon, has 
been appropriated by Great Ulfe's ores. Up to eleven of 
the creatures live here, but at the moment a group of 
them are out raiding the countryside nearby, and three 
others are on duty in area 4 . 
• 
This chamber is filled with rough-hewn bunks, tables, 
and chairs, and the floor is strewn with filthy pelts. At 
first glance it appears that a dozen or so humanoids 
might use this area as a sleeping quarters. 
Creatures. Only Old Yarrack the orog and four ores 
are at home when the characters enter the chamber. 
They enter combat as soon as they're aware of intruders. 
If the battle goes poorly for the ores, Old Yarrack or­
ders an ore to break off and summon help from area 9. 
If things get desperate, he sends for help from the ores 
in area 11. If the ores here fall, Yarrack attempts to join 
Great Ulfe's forces in area 12. The orog carries a potion 
of healing and drinks it if his current hit points drop to 
one-fourth his hit point maximum or lower. 
Secret Door. The ores don't know about the secret 
door in the western wall, but a character who searches 
the spot can discover it with a successful DC 15 Wis­
dom (Perception) check. 
Development. Two days after the characters arrive, 
he first raiding party returns and reinforces this room 
with four more ores. Thus, the party might encounter as 
many as nine creatures in this room. 
Any ores slain in area 4 are replaced by ores from this 
room, if any survive. 
Treasure. A successful DC 10 Wisdom check reveals 
a loose stone on the south wall, concealing a sack that 
holds 250 sp and 40 gp. Aside from his potion of heal­
ing, Old Yarrack keeps his personal treasure in area 8. 
Old Yarrack carries the key to the cage door in area 6. 
THE GLITTERHAME 
Below the Mountain Door lies the Glitterhame, a large 
eries of natural caverns in the heart of the Stone Tooth. 
The caverns are beautiful : the walls sparkle and glis­
·en with flecks of semiprecious stone, and millennia of 
-culpting and erosion by water have created sheets of 
uted flowstone , delicate stalactites, and majestic stalag­
mites. Water streams down through the caverns toward 
an underground river far below. 
The Glitterhame is now home to a band of troglodytes, 
dangerous reptilian savages that haunt underground 
places. The troglodytes and Great Ulfe's tribe maintain an uneasy peace, although skirmishes occur. The troglo­
dytes usually use the old ore tunnel (see area 21) to hunt 
on the surface and leave the ores alone. In return, Great 
Ulfe's followers rarely invade the troglodytes' domain. 
The following locations are identified on map 2.3. 
15. THE COLD STREAM 
If the characters take the steps down from area 10, 
they emerge into a narrow tunnel with a subterranean 
stream flowing across it. 
The stairway twists and turns a long way downward . The 
floor has been cut into hundreds of shallow steps, but 
the walls and ceiling are still natural rock. About sixty 
feet down, a rushing stream spills from a narrow crack to 
the south and crosses the stairway, disappearing into a 
narrow, winding tunnel to the north. The rill is only two 
or three feet wide. 
If the characters explore the route taken by the stream, 
they have to go single file as they wade through the wa­
ter. The bed of the fast-moving stream slants sharply; 
each character must make a successful DC 8 Strength 
(Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to descend 
safely. If the check fails by 5 or more, the character falls, 
tumbling 20 feet downhill and taking 3 (ld6) bludgeon­
ing damage. 
VISION IN THE GLITTERHAME 
Range of vision is important in the characters' exploration 
of this level. Most light sources don't illuminate beyond 
60 feet, and many of the chambers and passages in the 
Glitterhame are much larger than that. The darkness hides 
many perils. 
CHAPTER 2 I THE FORGE OF FURY 43 

--- PAGE 45 ---

44 MAP 2.3: THE GLITTERHA ME 
15A. STIRGE COLONY 
Creatures. Stirges have made their nest in a small 
cave overlooking the stream, about halfway down the 
passage. Fissures at the back of the cave run 150 feet 
to the surface, but nothing larger than a stirge can fit 
through. Six stirges are sleeping in the nest, but any 
noise or light from a party descending the streambed 
wakes them. Each round after the characters enter the 
cave, ld4 stirges wake and attack, until all are active. 
Treasure. On the floor at the back of the stirge cave 
lies the desiccated corpse of a dwarf explorer who died 
here many years ago-part of the failed expedition. A 
leather pouch on its belt contains 35 gp. 
16. HIGH CAVERN 
The first chamber of the Glitterhame proper is bisected 
by the stream and has a number of routes leading 
away from it. 
The descending fissure opens up abruptly into a very 
high cavern, its ceiling easily forty feet or more overhead. 
The stairway continues to wind down along a ledge that 
follows the north wall of the chamber. A fast-moving 
CHAPTER 2 I THE FORGE OF FURY stream about five feet wide runs across the floor of the 
chamber from the north and disappears under a low 
stone overhang to the south, and larger passageways exit 
to the southeast and the northeast . 
Creatures. Four stirges are clinging to the chamber 
walls high overhead. They can see any light source that 
is brought into this chamber, but they are very hard 
to spot in turn, owing to the height of the ceiling. The 
stirges have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks 
made to hide unless a character specifically looks for 
danger overhead, so they might surprise the party. 
The stream exits the south wall of the cavern through 
a passage only 3 feet high, half filled by water, which 
serves as an entrance to the troglodytes ' lair (area 17). 
Anyone who searches the stream's banks finds the foot­
prints of Medium reptilian creatures and tracks left by 
tails with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check. 
To reach area 17 from this cave, a Medium or larger 
character must crouch down and then wade or crawl 
through the stream. Torches and lanterns are difficult to 
keep lit, since the lowest point of the ceiling in this pas­
sage is only about 6 inches above the water's surface. 

--- PAGE 46 ---

: 7. TROGLODYTE CAVERN 
The troglodytes that infest the Glitterhame ha,·e claimed 
one of the largest caverns as a common room and food 
:corage area. They defend it against all intruders. Char­
acters coming from area 16 might not be able co see 
everything at first. 
• Floundering through the cold, swift stream, you emerge 
in a huge cavern. The ceiling must be thirty feet over­
head, and the far end of the cave is lost in darkness . 
A foul stench assaults your nostrils immediately. The 
remnants of butchered game animals hang from crude 
wooden stakes along the cavern walls, and you spot a 
pair of ore corpses treated in the same fashion. 
The grisly trophies that decorate the room represent 
about two or three weeks' worth of meals for the trog­
lodyte tribe. The troglodytes like to let their meat age 
a bit before eating it, so most of the carcasses here are 
appallingly decayed. 
Creatures. Two troglodytes are hiding in the north­
ern end of this area, one on each side of the stream. 
Their Chameleon Skin trait gives them advantage on 
Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide. They attack 
as soon as two characters have entered the area, likely 
achieving surprise. 
Mud-and-Wattle Door. The troglodytes have blocked 
the southwest passage leading to the main warren 
area 18) with a crude plug made of mud and wattle. A 
-uccessful DC 10 Strength check is required to pull it 
open. If alerted by the sounds of battle, the troglodytes 
on the far side secure the door, increasing the DC of the 
check to 15. 
Pool. The stream flows through the center of the 
cavern, growing somewhat wider and deeper until it 
reaches the southeast corner. The pool in that loca­
tion is about 20 feet across and about 10 feet deep in 
he middle. 
Along the eastern edge of the pool, a short passage 
leading to area 23 has been blocked up with loose rub­
ble and mud, creating a rough stone wall 10 feet across. 
Characters can break through this barrier with some 
effort; it has AC 16 and 50 hit points per 5-foot segment. 
18. TROGLODYTE WARREN 
:\fost of the troglodytes dwell in a group of dismal cav­
erns, occupying three caves that branch off the warren's 
central area to the northwest , southwest, and southeast. 
• 
• The passage opens into a long, low cavern that has three 
narrow, twisting passages leading off into darkness. Nu­
merous rock columns rise to meet the stone overhead. 
The air is thick with troglodyte stench, and the floor is lit· 
tered with refuse from the monsters' meals and gnawed 
bones of dubious origin. 
Something scrapes and hisses in the dark, and you 
hear the soft padding of scaly feet on rock. Characters who are being stealthy might catch the trog­
lodytes unawares. If the characters are carrying any 
light sources or making a lot of noise when they enter, 
the troglodytes in the west and southeast chambers are 
alerted. As soon as any fighting begins, one troglodyte 
attempts to escape to the north, toward area 19, and 
summon Kaarghaz, the chieftain. 
Northwest Chamber. Two troglodytes are sleeping 
in the small cave to the northwest when the characters 
enter area 18. 
Southwest Chamber. The females tend the colony's 
eggs and raise hatchlings in the southwest cave. Six 
troglodytes defend the hatchery and fight to the death to 
defend their young. 
The chamber also contains two dozen noncombatant 
hatchlings , which scurry away from intruders. Charac­
ters receive no XP for slaughtering them . 
Southeast Chamber. Three troglodytes recently re­
turned from the hunt are relaxing in the southeast cave. 
Unless they are alerted to the characters ' presence, 
they are concentrating on devouring what's left of a 
small deer. 
Tactics. If the characters attack the troglodytes in 
the northwest or southeast chamber, those in the other 
chamber hear the sounds of battle and rush to assist. 
The troglodyt es in the southwest chamber remain there 
to protect the hatchlings ; if the characters attack the 
hatchery first, all the troglodyt es from the other cham­
bers come to join the fight. 
19. CHIEFTAIN'S CAVE 
The door leading north from area 18 is a mud-and-wat­
tle barrier wedged in place; a successful DC 10 Strength 
check is required to pull it aside. 
Glowing coals in a crude hearth illuminate this large 
cave. The ceiling here rises about fifteen feet above the 
floor, and rubbish and skins cover the floor. A lizard the 
size of a small horse rises and slowly slithers toward you. 
Creatures. The chief of the troglodytes , Kaarghaz , 
occupies the chamber along with his pet giant lizard. 
Kaarghaz is a troglodyte with the following changes, 
which increase his challenge rating to 2 (450 XP): 
His AC is 13 (natural armor). 
He has 39 (6d8 + 12) hit points. 
, His Charisma is 15 (+2). 
, He can speak Draconic and Troglodyte. 
, He has an additional trait: 
Spellcasting. Kaarghaz is a 4th-level spellcaster . His spellcast­
ing ability is Charisma (spell save DC 12, +4 to hit with spell 
attacks). He knows the following sorcerer spells: 
Cantrips (at will):.fire bolt, mage hand, poison spray, prestidigita· 
tion, ray of frost 
1st level (6 slots): burning hands, shield, sleep 
2nd level (3 slots): invisibility, scorching ray 
If the characters make a Jot of noise or tip off their 
presence in some other way, Kaarghaz begins this en­
counter invisible (see below). Otherwise , read: 
CHAPTER '2 I THE FORGE OF FURY 45 

--- PAGE 47 ---

Behind the lizard, a hulking, scaly-skinned creature easily 
a foot taller than any of the others you've seen glares at 
you and snarls. 
If Kaarghaz is alerted to the party's approach, he casts 
invisibility on himself before they enter. If he loses at 
least half his hit points, he tries to escape (using invis­
ibility if possible). If his escape succeeds, he soon af­
terward rounds up a war party of surviving troglodytes 
from other areas to track down and ambush the party. 
Negotiation. Kaarghaz starts out hostile and won't 
become friendly to the characters. Nevertheless, a char­
acter who speaks Draconic might be able to stave off 
combat by parleying with the chieftain. For example, the 
characters might have captured some of the hatchlings 
in the southwest chamber, intending to ransom them 
back to the troglodytes in exchange for treasure. Even 
if Kaarghaz can be convinced to give up some of his 
wealth, he doesn't let the matter rest-he forms a war 
party (as described above) and goes after the characters. 
Treasure. The chief's chamber is strewn with tro­
phies, including the skulls, bones, hides, and weapons 
of defeated foes. Amid the mess, a small square of black 
silk hides a ruby worth 300 gp. It can be found with a 
successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check. A bat­
tered wooden chest with leather hasps holds 1,500 sp. 
20. SCALY LAIR 
The swift stream passes over a steep slab of bedrock in 
front of a short passage. The cave beyond is long and 
low, with an uneven ceiling about ten feet high. In the 
southern end of the room, an enormous white-scaled liz­
ard lunges and snaps, but you can see that a sturdy chain 
around its neck tethers it in place. The agitated creature 
twists in frustration, its tail lashing. 
Behind the lizard lie a couple of iron chests. 
Creature. The cavern holds the troglodytes' secret 
weapon-a freshly captured giant subterranean lizard 
(see appendix B). Although the lizard is chained, it can 
attack anyone who comes within its reach. It strikes 
with its tail first, hoping to knock a target prone, then 
snaps at it with its powerful jaws to gulp it down. 
Treasure. The two chests contain a total of 2,200 sp. 
One holds a potion of climbing, and the other a potion of 
water breathing. 
21. 0RC TUNNEL 
Several passages branch away from this large, high-ceil­
inged cavern. To the north, a carved, square-mouthed 
tunnel shows that someone has been at work in these 
caves. A gate of rough-hewn timber blocks a small pas­
sage to the northeast. Three other passageways wind off 
toward the south. A heavy animal smell lingers in the air. 
CHAPTER 2 I THE FORGE OF FURY A hundred years ago, the ores besieging Khundrukar 
tunneled into the dwarven stronghold. The cavern they 
emerged in now serves as a guard post and a mustering 
point for troglodyte raiders. 
The tunnel in the northern end of the area runs about 
500 feet and opens on the hillside (see the "Ore Tunnel" 
subsection of "Scout the Area," page 35). The troglo­
dytes use the opening to raid and hunt on the surface. 
Creatures. In the northern part of the cavern, near 
the passages that run east and west, two troglodytes 
are hiding. From their Chameleon Skin trait, they have 
advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks to hide. The 
troglodyte on the west side waits for an opportune mo­
ment to attack intruders with surprise. The other moves 
east to the gate and opens it to release a brown bear, 
which attacks any non-troglodyte in the next round (roll 
initiative for the bear when it is released). 
Bear Pen. A sturdy timber gate, latched on the out­
side, seals a smaller cave to the east. The bear attacks 
any non-troglodyte that opens the cage door, then tries 
to escape through the tunnel. 
The animal isn't trained but has come to expect food 
from the troglodytes. It is hostile toward strangers, but 
someone proficient in Animal Handling might be able to 
calm it down with a DC 15 Wisdom check. If the check 
succeeds and no troglodytes remain nearby, the charac­
ters can release it safely and let it depart. 
22. FUNGUS CAVERN 
A trickle of water seeping down from the hillside above 
reaches this irregular cavern, nourishing a profusion of 
fungus-weird puffballs, tall caps, and patches offuzzy 
mold in a variety of colors. A golden-brown carpet of 
mold covers an old skeleton in rusted mail in the south­
ern part of the room, and a narrow passageway leads 
to another small room beyond this one. A surprisingly 
bright sword gleams in the skeleton's bony grasp. 
Hazard. The skeleton that the characters first see is 
that of a dwarf. From its location, it's possible for some­
one to see a second skeleton (human) in the south end of 
the chamber. Both skeletons are covered with a particu­
larly virulent form of mold. A character can identify the 
threat with a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Nature) or 
Wisdom (Survival) check. 
If either skeleton is touched, the mold ejects a cloud of 
spores that fill a 10-foot cube originating from the skel­
eton. Any creature in the area must succeed on a DC 15 
Constitution saving throw or take 10 (3d6) poison dam­
age and become poisoned for 1 minute. At the end of 
this time, unless the poisoned condition is removed, the 
creature must repeat the saving throw, taking 17 (5d6) 
poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage 
on a successful one. Exposing a patch of the mold to 
sunlight or dealing any fire damage to it destroys it. 
Treasure. The dwarf skeleton clutches a +I long­
sword that bears Durgeddin's smith-mark. The hu­
man skeleton wears a steel helmet chased with silver, 
worth 110 gp.

23. DWARVEN SEPULCHERS 
• You gaze into an extremely large cave faintly lit by nat­
ural phosphorescence. Its ceiling rises fifty feet high in 
places. Crystals glimmer softly in the eerie light. Weird, 
beautiful flows and structures of delicate stone grace the 
chamber. The western portion of the great cave is sep­
arated from the rest by a steep bluff; the ceiling here is 
half the height of the rest of the chamber. 
A couple dozen large stone sepulchers line the cavern 
walls, each carved with intricate reliefs and designs and 
marked with Dwarvish runes. 
The upper portion of the great cavern was intended to 
be the final resting place of Durgeddin's clan. 
Durgeddin and his followers feared that their war 
against the ores would ultimately claim them all, so they 
built their own tombs during the first phase of carving 
out the stronghold. Ironically , only a handful of the 
dwarves were ever interred here; the rest lie where they 
fell when the ores stormed Khundrukar. 
The troglodytes have a superstitious fear of the tombs 
and refuse to set foot in this part of the Glitterhame. 
They don't pursue characters who enter this area. 
If the characters investigate the tombs at greater 
length, read: 
• Twenty-three sepulchers stand here. The lids are carved 
in the likenesses of grim dwarves in armor. Dwarvish 
runes on the front of each tomb appear to represent 
the names of the occupants or the intended occupants. 
Three of the stone coffins have additional runes carved 
into them. If someone in the party can read Dwarvish, the follow­
ing details become apparent: 
The additional runes record the occupant's date of death 
and the great deeds the dwarf performed in life. Also 
carved into these three coffins is a warning that doom 
awaits any who dare to defile the honorable dead. 
The names on these three sepulchers are those of Bor­
gol the Old, Gharin Ore-Doom, and Numik the Unlucky. 
Treasure. Each tomb is a marble vault 6 feet long, 4 
feet high, and 3 feet wide, with a heavy stone lid. Despite 
the warnings carved on the tombs, there is no danger 
here. Even if the characters disturb Borgol, Gharin, or 
Numik, all they find are old bones and no undead. 
The three dwarves were buried with little funerary 
wealth; Durgeddin's folk believed in honoring their dead 
with stone, not riches. Borgol's remains include a ring 
of gold in the shape of a dragon holding its tail in its 
mouth, worth 120 gp. Gharin was buried with a finely 
crafted warhammer inset with a garnet, worth 110 gp. 
24. THE GLITTERHAME 
This great cavern glimmers with a faint phosphores­
cence. The ceiling is almost fifty feet overhead, and 
bright flecks and gleaming stone formations are visible 
in the distance. Patches of strange fungi dot the floor, 
including capped stalks standing as tall as a human and 
glowing puffballs almost a yard wide. 
High ledges rise fifteen to twenty feet above the floor 
on the north, south, and west walls. Narrow passageways 
lead off to the north and the south, and a flight of carved 
stone stairs descends from the western ledge to a path 
that meanders through the center of the chamber toward 
a small iron door in the eastern wall. Audible throughout 
the entire chamber is the sigh of a soft, cool breeze that 
rises toward the surface far above. 
The fungal growths are harmless . In fact, the stalks and 
the puffballs are edible, if not especially tasty. The dan­
ger lies in the grick nest that overlooks the path. 
Creatures. Two gricks lurk in the 20-foot-high rock­
fall that spills down from area 26, at the place where the 
path leading east comes closest to the slope. They are 
wedged into spaces between boulders, 6 to 8 feet above 
the cavern floor. Their Stone Camouflage trait gives 
them advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to 
hide, so they might surprise the party. 
The gricks attack anyone who travels on the path 
next to the rockfall or climbs anywhere along the slope 
that leads to area 26. Any character trying to scale the 
rockfall while under attack must succeed on a DC 8 
Strength (Athletics) check to make progress. If the char­
acters reach area 26 by some other means, the gricks 
move to attack them there. 
CHAPTER '2 I THE FORGE OF FURY 47 

--- PAGE 49 ---

25. LONG CAVERN 
The thunderous roar of falling water fills this long, low 
chamber, and spray makes everything slick and wet. A 
fast stream rushes through the center of the cavern, 
emerging from beneath a crude dam of rock and mud 
in the western wall. The stream disappears into a dark 
shaft at the cavern's eastern end. A rough, winding path 
follows the stream toward the east. 
The chamber runs from the troglodyte warrens to a nat­
ural shaft on the east end that leads down into the Sink­
hole (see area 28). The stream spills over the edge of the 
shaft in a subterranean waterfall, and near the waterfall 
a narrow, winding stairwell leads down. 
Slippery Slope. The smooth cavern floor slopes down 
toward the stream, and much of the area immediately 
north of the stream is covered v:ith a thin layer of slime. 
The slime makes the floor very slippery. Its presence 
can be discerned with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Per­
ception) or Wisdom (Survival) check. 
Any creature that enters the slippery slope or starts its 
move there must make a DC 12 Dexterity (Acrobatics) 
check. A creature that fails the check falls prone and 
slides southward toward the stream at half its walking 
speed. The stream is flowing fast enough that anyone 
who falls in must succeed on a DC 10 Strength saving 
throw to avoid being swept over the waterfall. 
A creature that goes over the waterfall lands in a pool 
60 feet below (see area 28), taking 10 (3d6) bludgeoning 
damage and suffering one level of exhaustion. 
26. GRICK LAIR 
A rocky ledge sits at the top of a steep, irregular rockfall 
about twenty feet high. The mouth of a side cavern leads 
into darkness beyond. 
Creatures. The two gricks hidden in the rockfall (see 
area 24) make their lair at the end of a passage that 
winds north from the ledge. They are encountered here 
if they retreated to attack characters who got past them. 
Treasure. The gricks discarded the inedible portions 
of their victims in the back of the cave. Rooting through 
the grisly remains uncovers a suit of scale mail and scat­
tered coins totaling 200 cp, 180 sp, and 60 gp. 
27. IRON DOOR 
The entrance to Durgeddin's halls and forges lies be­
hind a sturdy locked door. 
Cut into the cavern wall is a small but strong-looking 
door of iron plates, about five feet tall and four feet wide. 
Heavy rivets stud its surface, and a tarnished silver 
rune-Durgeddin's smith-mark-gleams on the door's 
rusted face. 
CHAPTER 2 I THE FORGE OF FURY The door consists of two pieces of sheet iron bolted to 
a strong frame. A pintle is fitted through the door's mid­
dle, so it has no hinges. It can be opened with the key on 
the dwarf skeleton in the prison (see area 34). A charac­
ter can pick the lock with thieves' tools and a successful 
DC 18 Dexterity check. Breaking the door down is very 
difficult, requiring a successful DC 25 Strength check. 
On the other side of the door is a steep staircase that 
leads up to area 35 in the Foundry. 
THE SINKHOLE 
The stream that flows through the Glitterhame de­
scends through the chasm in area 25 to an even lower 
level of caverns-the Sinkhole. Here it joins a subter­
ranean river that traverses dark caverns and forgotten 
storerooms before connecting with the Black Lake. 
None of the monsters that inhabit the complex regu­
larly visit this place. The black dragon Nightscale some­
times swims through its submerged areas, using the 
river as a back door to its lair. 
A narrow staircase winds down along the chasm walls 
until reaching bottom, where it offers access to area 28. 
The following locations are identified on map 2.4. 
28. WATERFALL CAVERN 
A loud waterfall spills down the northwest wall of this 
cavern into a deep pool. The rocky walls glisten with 
spray, and a weird array of colorful minerals and strange 
lichens lend an unearthly beauty to this spot. A fast-mov­
ing stream runs south from the pool at the base of the 
falls, and a nearby natural passage heads in the same 
direction. A set of narrow stairs cut into the rock wind up 
to the north, and two old wooden doors stand in a wall 
of dressed stone to the east. 
The stream flowing from area 25 in the Glitterhame 
pours down into the chamber. 
The pool is populated by harmless blind fish and 
white crustaceans but contains nothing dangerous. 
The outflowing stream drains into the river in area 29. 
Any characters who fell into the pool are carried by the 
current toward the outflow at about 20 feet per round. A 
character who ends up in the river might be swept away; 
see "Fast-Flowing Water," page 51. 
29. RIVER CAVERN 
This long, narrow cavern is half-filled with an under­
ground river, flowing along at a rapid pace. A narrow 
ledge on the north side overlooks the river. A bridge of 
stone spans the river, leading to a larger ledge on the 
south side that follows the course of the river to the east. 
The underground river flows swiftly from east to west. 
The bridge is sturdy and sound; there's no danger in 
crossing it. 

--- PAGE 50 ---

' 
MAP 2.4: THE S1NKHOLE 
Watery Peril. At the west end of the cavern, the ceil­
ing lowers to meet the surface of the river. Any creature 
swept past this point by the current is trapped in a long, 
airless underground channel and is likely to drown (see 
·suffocating" in chapter 8 of the Player's Handbook). In 
addition, the creature must make a successful DC 12 
trength saving throw each round or take ld6 bludgeon ­
ing damage as it is battered by rocks. Even creatures 
that can breathe water aren't likely to survive for long. 
The stream runs underground for about 5 miles 
before emerging on a hillside to the west of the 
Stone Tooth. 
30. OLD STOREROOM 
The northern door in area 28 has swollen shut from 
dampness. A successful DC 10 Strength check is re­
quired to force it open. Durgeddin's folk formerly used 
the large chamber beyond as a storeroom. 
• The door gives way grudgingly, revealing a low cham­
ber of dressed stone. This chamber is filled with what 
appears to be rotten food-barrels of salted meat gone 
bad, sacks of flour or grain covered in russet-colored 
mold, tuns of cider turned to vinegar. 
Two open archways in the east wall lead to a similar 
room, and two more openings are dimly visible beyond. 
The floor just past the first archway gleams wetly. 
Creature. None of the supplies are salvageable. While 
earching, the characters might blunder into a gray 
ooze that occupies the middle chamber of the three. 
While motionless, the ooze is indistinguishable from 
a patch of wet stone. It is alerted when characters force 
open the door, and it strikes at the first character who 
enters the middle chamber, attacking with surprise. 
• What appeared to be a wet patch on the floor suddenly 
twists like a snake and lunges toward you! I 31. EMPTY STOREROOM 
The southern door in area 28 is swollen shut and re­
quires a successful DC 10 Strength check to open. The 
chamber on the other side of the door resembles area 
30, but it is empty. The ores broke in and carried off 
most of its contents during the fall of Khundrukar. 
32.FLOOD EDSTOREROOM 
A year or so ago, a season of heavy rains on the surface 
raised the level of the subterranean river to create a mi­
nor flood. Water still stands at the bottom of the stairs. 
A short flight of stone steps leads down to a wooden 
door that stands half-open. Dark, stagnant water pools 
in the small landing at the base of the steps and in the 
doorway, presumably filling the room beyond as well. The 
area smells of rot. 
Diseased Pool. The water is about 5 feet deep and 
is tainted by disease. Anyone who drinks the water or 
wades into it is exposed and must succeed on a DC 10 
Constitution saving throw to avoid infection . Symptoms 
manifest one day after exposure and include high fever, 
muscle spasms, and eventual paralysis. 
An infected creature suffers one level of exhaustion 
when it finishes the first long rest it takes after being 
exposed. Whenever it finishes a long rest thereafter , 
it must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On 
a failed save, the creature suffers another level of ex­
haustion. On a successful save, its exhaustion level is 
reduced by one. If its exhaustion level reaches 5, the 
infected creature becomes paralyzed until the disease is 
cured or the effect is removed with a lesser restoration 
spell or similar magic. If a successful saving throw re­
duces the infected creature's exhaustion level to 0, the 
creature recovers from the disease. 
Treasure. Submerged in the corner of the eastern 
vault is the skeleton of an ore killed a century ago. The 
skeleton rests atop a rotted leather pouch that contains 
a potion of water breathing and a potion of invisibility. 
CHAPTER 2 I THE FORGE OF FUR\ 49 

--- PAGE 51 ---

33. ROPER'S CAVERN 
• 
ne rock stairs climb steeply, turn north, and then de­
scend toward the east into a cavern very much like the 
one you just left, but smaller. A ledge along the river con­
tinues east to a door on the north wall, and the rushing 
river separates you from a ledge on the southern side. 
A large, strange-looking stalagmite stands in the mid­
dle of the southern ledge. A cave fish flops helplessly on 
the bank nearby. 
Creature. The southern ledge is the home of a rav­
enous roper that has been feeding on fish from the 
stream. Unsatisfied with this diet, the roper is eager for 
larger prey. 
Even characters who look closely at the roper can't 
tell that it's anything other than a stalagmite unless it 
moves. The roper is difficult to sneak up on. If a charac­
ter manages to approach without alerting it, continue: 
A strand extends from the stalagmite, with the thrashing 
cave fish in its grasp. It pulls the fish toward the rock 
formation-and then, suddenly, a fang-filled maw gapes 
open in the stalagmite and devours the fish in one bite. 
The roper attacks when any character gets at least 20 
feet into the cave, gaining surprise if its presence hasn't 
been revealed. It can target up to four characters with its 
tendrils, possibly pulling those it has grappled into the 
rushing river. Characters in the water have advantage on 
checks to escape the grapple due to the force of the cur­
rent. The river poses a severe hazard in itself, though; 
see "Fast-Flowing Water," page 51. 
Development. The roper is satisfied, ending the 
attack, after it devours one Small or larger creature. 
It can't speak or understand languages, but it has a 
bestial intelligence and might be persuaded to accept a 
substitute meal. As long as the food is alive, the roper 
isn't picky. 
Treasure. Cutting open the roper's stony gizzard 
reveals a ring of spell storing and six gemstones: a ruby 
worth 1,000 gp, two emeralds worth 400 gp each, and 
three serpentines worth 60 gp apiece. 
34. PRISON 
If the characters get past the roper in area 33, they 
can explore an area that was used as a prison in 
Durgeddin's day. 
A sturdy door of iron plate stands open in the north wall 
of the cavern. Inside you see a short passageway with 
three small iron doors set into the west wall. The first two 
are open, but the door at the end of the hall is closed. 
The door to the northern cell is locked. With a search of 
the grimy floor and a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perep-

--- PAGE 52 ---

tion) check, a character discovers an old jailer·s ·ey that 
fits the lock. Otherwise, the lock can be pie ·ed b_ · ome­
one who succeeds on a DC 15 Dexterity chec · using 
thieves' tools. 
The first two cells are empty. The locked cell hold the 
keletal remains of a dwarf in rusted plate armor. This 
individual was one of Durgeddin's chief lieutenants: the 
ores captured her during the final battle and threw her 
in this cell for interrogation later. Afterward, the unfor­
tunate warrior was forgotten and left to starve. 
Treasure. The suit of plate is too corroded to be of 
any use, but a search of the corpse produces a small silk 
purse containing 8 pp and a key that opens the iron door 
in area 27. · 
THE FOUNDRY 
Durgeddin's followers lived and worked in a series of 
carved halls and chambers beyond the Glitterhame . 
. lost of this part of the complex was thoroughly ran­
sacked when the dwarven citadel fell. 
Unlike the Mountain Door or the Glitterhame, which 
offer exits to the surface world, the Foundry isn't readily 
accessible. The area isn't abandoned, though. Undead 
orrors wait in its darkest recesses, and dwarf-crafted 
raps still work perfectly well despite their age. In ad­
dition, a small number of duergar have come here to 
breathe life into Durgeddin's old forges and decipher the 
:ecrets of the master smith's work. 
If the characters come to this part of the complex 
·rom the Black Lake (see the "Dark Mere" subsection of 
cout the Area," page 35), they begin in area 38. 
The following locations are identified on map 2.5. 
35. CHAMBER OF STATUES 
:n the corridor behind the iron door in area 27, a flight 
of steep stone stairs climbs 30 feet northward. 
The stairs end at the entrance to an octagonal chamber. 
~he floor is inlaid with cracked, dusty blue tiles, and the 
Nalls are dressed with polished marble. Large doors of 
ron-bound oak exit to the northwest and northeast. 
Three cast bronze statues, almost ten feet tall, stand 
oy the west, north, and east walls. Each depicts an armed 
e1warf. The eastern and western ones carry axes and 
shields. The center statue is armed with two axes. The 
ceiling rises in a dome almost thirty feet above the floor. 
From somewhere in the distance, you can hear the 
raint ringing of hammer on anvil. 
he sound of the hammering comes from beyond the 
ast wall, as can be determined with a successful DC 13 
·isdom (Perception) check. Anyone who examines the 
"oor notices that the dust is somewhat disturbed. A suc­
essful DC 13 Wisdom (Survival) check reveals an infre­
uently used trail that leads from the entrance stairs to 
· e stone wall behind the east statue. 
Statue Trap. The obvious exits to the northeast and 
orthwest are false doors that open onto blank stone. 
?ulling on either door releases a catch that causes the axe-wielding hands of the two closest statues to drop. 
Any creature within 5 feet of a door when it is opened is 
subjected to two melee attacks: +5 to hit; 9 (2d8) slash­
ing damage on a hit. 
With a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, 
a character can discern small scorings on the floor in 
front of a door, left by earlier axe strokes. A successful 
DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check enables a char­
acter to deduce that the doors aren't what they seem, 
through small clues showing that they are unused. The 
same check focused on a statue can reveal a small line 
on the arm that holds an axe, indicating the arm's abil­
ity to move. 
FAST-FLOWING WATER 
The underground river that cuts through this level of the 
dungeon presents a serious hazard. Those who fall in risk 
being swept away by the current. 
A creature that falls in the river and is within 5 feet of the 
water's edge must succeed on a DC 10 Strength saving 
throw to catch itself on the rocky bank. On a failed save, 
or if the creature is too far away from the bank, it is drawn 
into the main current. 
A creature in the main current that takes no other action 
is swept 60 feet downstream (to the south or to the west, 
depending on location) each round. If it spends its action 
to make a DC l O Strength (Athletics) check and the check 
is a success, it can reduce the distance traveled by the 
amount of its walking speed and move toward a bank. 
On a failed check, the creature must succeed on a DC 10 
Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion. 
Creatures that have a swim speed can take the Dash action 
and use their full swim speed without making a Strength 
check. A creature within 5 feet of a bank can pull itself out 
of the current as part of its move. 
CHAPTER 2 I THE FORGE OF FURY 51 

--- PAGE 53 ---

52 MAP 2.5: THE FouNOR Y 
A character who makes a successful DC 10 Dexterity 
check using thieves' tools can jam a statue's arm so that 
the axe can't swing. Destroying a statue (AC 18, 60 hit 
points, immunity to necrotic, poison, and psychic dam­
age) also disables its attack. 
Once a statue has attacked, the trap must be reset 
manually. If any duergar survive and remain here, they 
reset the trap within a day after it has been triggered . 
Secret Stairwell. The secret door behind the east 
statue is well hidden, requiring a successful DC 18 
Wisdom (Perception) check to spot. If the characters 
detected the faint trail that leads there, a successful DC 
10 Wisdom (Perception) check locates the door. Beyond 
is a flight of stone stairs that leads upward. 
The stairs have been warded with a magical alarm. 
When a creature ascends past the halfway point of the 
staircase, a magic mouth spell calls out in Dwarvish , 
"Alert! Alert! Intruders approach!" This sound warns the 
duergar guards in area 36. 
36. THE GREAT HALL 
At the top of the stairs from area 35 is a stone door 
carved with a glowering dwarf's face. It opens easily. 
This enormous hall is lined with ten great pillars, carved 
into the forms of giants and dragons, that support the 
vaulted ceiling high above. Guttering orange torches 
set in sconces along the walls illuminate the room, and 
a mighty throne sits on a dais at the opposite end. The 
walls were once covered with tile mosaics, but they have 
been smashed and defiled by graffiti. Tiny fragments of 
tile litter the floor. You can see five other exits. 
CHAPTER 2 I THE FORGE OF FURY A small fire smolders on the floor before the dais, 
where six sleeping pallets lie empty, surrounded by packs 
and supplies. The sound of hammers ringing on iron 
comes from beyond the doors to the south. 
Suddenly a harsh voice calls from the shadows of the 
pillars, "Go back the way you came! This is the only warn­
ing you'll get!" 
The cavern was formerly Durgeddin's throne room, 
banquet hall, and center of authority . Its ceiling is 30 
feet high, and the sconces are 10 feet above the floor. 
The throne is unremarkable: a short bench of stone that 
might have been decorated at some point in the past. 
The graffiti consists of crude epithets in the Ore lan­
guage insulting dwarves and their ancestry. 
Creatures . Two duergar guards and Ghared, a duer­
gar spy (see appendix B), stand watch here. Unless the 
party climbed the stairs from area 35 without triggering 
the magic mouth, the duergar are invisible. 
Negotiation. The duergar start hostile but wait to see 
if the characters attack. Ghared shouts the initial warn­
ing and speaks for the group; she's suspicious, greedy, 
and arrogant, but not stupid. She is willing to give in­
formation to the party if a character succeeds on a DC 
20 Charisma (Persuasion) check. The characters can 
change her attitude to indifferent, reducing the check 
DC to 10, with a suitable bribe (at least 100 gp). 
Ghared can share any of the following information if 
the party succeeds in getting her to converse : 
• The doors to the north lead to halls infested with un­
dead and cursed magic. 

--- PAGE 54 ---

The door to the southwest leads into the old kitchens. 
guarded by more cursed magic. 
A dragon lives in a large lake cavern deep below. 
The subterranean river flows from the lake through 
other parts of the complex below the Glitterhame. It"s 
fed from a lake on the surface. 
. • negotiations are successful, the duergar are willing to 
et the party enter the rooms to the north. With a suffi­
-1ently high Charisma (Persuasion) check and an indif­
:erent attitude from Ghared, the characters can get the 
uergar to escort them to the entrance to the dragon's 
·erritory (the chasm in area 38). The duergar will not 
allow the party into the bladeworks (area 37) without an 
e cort, and they prohibit entry into area 39. 
If the characters don't negotiate, or if talks go badly, 
combat ensues. 
Tactics. If combat occurs, the duerger guards first 
attack with their javelins. They use their Enlarge ability 
m the next round, taking cover behind two of the pillars 
before wading into melee. 
Meanwhile, Ghared remains invisible and maneuvers 
·o make a sneak attack, then enlarges herself after she 
becomes visible. She has a potion of healing, which she 
es if her current hit points drop to half her hit point 
!llaximum or lower. 
If two duergar fall in battle, the survivor tries to re­
·reat to area 37 or 39. 
37. THE BLADEWORKS 
:n what was Durgeddin's smithy and workplace, the du­
ergar are currently engaged in a secret project, hoping 
·o capture a spark of the master smith's vengeful magic. 
Double stone doors lead into a barrel-vaulted area con­
taining several furnaces. The eastern end of the chamber 
continues into a large, dark cave, from which a cold 
wind moans. A stream of water rushes from west to east 
through the center of the room, crossed by two stone 
bridges. On the other side of the stream, three bald, 
gray dwarves work at a roaring forge, beating a white-hot 
blade into shape on an old anvil. 
Creatures. Two duergar smiths are forging a blade 
at the forge in the center of the south wall. The work 
is overseen by Snurrevin, a duergar with the follow­
ing changes, which increase his challenge rating to 
2 (450 XP): 
He has 45 (7d8 + 14) hit points. 
• His Intelligence is 14 (+2). 
• He has an additional trait: 
Spellcasting. Snurrevin is a 3rd-level spellcaster. His spellcast­
ng ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 12, +4 to hit with spell 
attacks). He has the following wizard spells prepared: 
Cantrips (at will):.fire bolt, mage hand, minor illusion, 
shocking grasp 
1st level (4 slots): color spray, shield, silent image 
2nd level (2 slots): hold person, shatter Snurrevin has a familiar, a rat named Browngnaw , 
that hides in the shadows near the unlit forge to the 
east. The duergar are preoccupied with their task and 
don't notice the party's entrance unless the characters 
make themselves known. They object violently to intrud­
ers who aren't escorted by duergar. 
If a threat becomes apparent, the two smiths grab 
their weapons, use Enlarge, and move to guard the two 
bridges. If the fight goes against them, they turn invis­
ible and try to slip out to area 36, then join the other 
duergar in area 39. 
In combat, Snurrevin might cast shocking grasp 
through his hidden familiar, and he might use silent im­
age to confound enemies with realistic-seeming threats. 
Treasure. In the cold forge in the northwest corner 
of the room, Snurrevin has stashed 320 gp, 1,100 sp, a 
gold necklace set with ruby stones worth 900 gp, and a 
potion of hill giant strength. 
38. THE CHASM 
The stream running through the old dwarven bladeworks 
meanders through a natural cavern before tumbling into 
a great chasm. You can see nothing but darkness below, 
although the splashing of waters deep below is barely 
audible over the roar of the waterfall. 
To the north of the chasm, a small ledge is partially 
hidden by a spur of rock. 
The chasm is 120 feet deep. Anyone who falls in takes 
42 (12d6) bludgeoning damage and ends up in area 50 
of the Black Lake level. Climbing down the slippery 
stone next to the waterfall requires several successful 
DC 15 Strength (Athletics) checks, or DC 5 checks for a 
character who uses a rope. 
38A. CHAIN LADDER 
The rock spur on the northern ledge partially conceals 
an old chain ladder that leads down to area 51 of the 
Black Lake. The ladder isn't immediately obvious from 
the southern ledge, but a character who makes a suc­
cessful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check can spot it. 
39. COUNCIL CHAMBER 
The duergar have set up a guard post in what was once 
the council room of Khundrukar. 
The door behind the throne leads into a small audience 
chamber. A large table made of a single stone slab 
dominates the room's center, and old tapestries cling to 
the walls. A stone door in the far wall is carved with the 
dwarf's visage that you've seen elsewhere. 
One gray-skinned dwarf in scale mail and shield stands 
watch by the far door. He shouts and raises a javelin. 
Creatures. Unless the party is under Ghared's protec­
tion (see area 36), the lone duergar on duty fights to the 
death to protect his leader, who is in area 40.

--- PAGE 55 ---

54 ARUNDIL1S ANIMATED OBJECTS 
A century ago, the dwarf mage Arundil animated a number 
of objects to defend the Foundry against intruders other 
than dwarves. Many of these creations remain in place to­
day (in areas 41, 47, and 48). 
These animated objects never attack dwarves or duergar. 
In addition, a dwarf (including a duergar) can order an 
object to cease its attack. If so commanded, the object 
becomes immobile for 10 minutes, or until the one com­
manding it leaves the area. 
If the characters engage the duergar guard, the 
sounds of battle alert the leader, Nimira. She is a du­
ergar with the following changes, which increase her 
challenge rating to 3 (700 XP): 
• Her AC is 17 (splint armor). 
• She has 52 (8d8 + 16) hit points. 
, She has additional traits: 
Multiattack. Nimira makes two greatsword attacks. 
Greatsword. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one 
target. Hit: 9 (2d6 + 2) slashing damage, or 16 (4d6 + 2) slash­
ing damage while enlarged. 
Nimira uses Enlarge and comes out to join the fight 
in the next round. If her guard falls or she faces at least 
three enemies, and negotiation isn't an option, she turns 
invisible and tries to escape into area 36 or through the 
secret door that leads east out of area 40. 
Negotiation. Nimira is an excellent fighter, but she is 
pragmatic and willing to negotiate in the right circum­
stances. She knows the same information as the duer­
gar in area 36 and might be convinced to guide the party 
to the chasm that leads to the dragon's lair (area 38). 
40. DuRGEDDIN's QUARTERS 
Durgeddin led a spartan lifestyle, eschewing rich deco­
rations and treasures in his personal quarters . Nimira 
has appropriated the room for her own use. 
This room appears to be a bedchamber. In one corner to 
the south stands a large wooden sleeping platform, badly 
gouged by axe blows and partially burned. A table, a 
bench, and a writing desk have been similarly treated. in 
the middle of the southern wall, a space has been cleared 
for a simple sleeping pallet and a pair of large satchels. 
Two doors exit the room to the north. 
If the party enters the room through the secret door in 
the closet (see below), or if the characters avoided or 
quietly dealt with the guard in area 39, Nimira is here, 
resting on the pallet. Otherwise, the room is empty. The 
satchels contain mundane supplies: extra clothes, food, 
lamp oil, and similar stuff. 
The door in the northwest corner leads to a bathing 
area, fitted with two small clay tanks to hold wash water. 
The northeast door opens into a closet containing the 
mildewed remnants of several cloaks. 
Secret Door. The east wall of the closet conceals 
a secret door. The door isn't well hidden, requiring a 
CHAPTER 2 I THE FORGE OF FURY successful DC 10 \n dom (Perception) check to find. 
Nimira knows abour the secret passage and escapes 
through it if pressed. 
41. KITCHENS 
The stairs leading south from the pillared hall end at a 
wooden door. Beyond is a corridor that opens up into a 
large room lined with hearths. This room must once have 
served as the kitchen: pots, pans, cauldrons, and ket-
tles lie scattered on the floor and strewn across several 
tables. An archway to the west leads into a pantry filled 
with rotted foodstuffs. Suddenly, you hear a scraping 
sound, and a big wooden table shudders and begins to 
move, heading right for you! 
Creature. An animated table (see appendix B) acti­
vates when someone enters the main part of the room. 
It fights until destroyed but won't attack a dwarf. See the 
"Arundil's Animated Objects" sidebar. 
The room is full of old, rusty iron pots, pans, cutlery, 
and cooking utensils, none of which are worth much. 
42. DESECRATED SHRINE 
Durgeddin made his last stand in Khundrukar's shrine, 
laying enemies low until the ores finally overwhelmed 
him. Ore shamans pronounced dire curses over his 
remains to ensure that their terrible foe would never re­
turn. Then they entombed a fierce ore warrior to defend 
it forever in undeath. 
The door leading from area 36 bears an inscription in 
Ore: "Beyond this door the Maker of Death is chained. 
May he gnaw on his own hate until the sun dies and all 
things end." 
This room was once a shrine to the gods of the dwarves. 
The walls are carved with their dour images, and a low 
stone altar stands at the western end of the room. Stone 
benches have been smashed and thrown askew, and the 
icons of the gods have been defaced. 
Atop the altar, arms folded over his chest, lies the an­
cient corpse of a dwarf warrior in plate armor. Bones lie 
heaped around the altar's base, and at its foot crouches 
the desiccated body of an ore in studded leather. 
Creatures. The ore champion is now a wight, an 
undead monster that thirsts for life essence. Two of 
the piles of bones are ogre skeletons (use the ogre stat 
block; give it the undead creature type, vulnerability to 
bludgeoning damage, immunity to poison damage, and 
immunity to the exhaustion and poisoned conditions; 
and remove its ability to speak). The ogres were slain 
during the final battle and later animated to join the ore 
warrior in his watch. 
The wight and skeletons lie immobile until someone 
enters. They can't pursue characters outside room. 

--- PAGE 56 ---

Some of the bones at the foot of the altar stir and form 
nto a pair of towering skeletons clutching greatclubs. 
The dead ore warrior looks up at you and grins evilly, 
green fire burning in its hate-filled eyes as it stands. 
Treasure. The ores looted the shrine after the fall of 
~undrukar, but two members of the previous expedi­
on fell to the undead defenders with valuables in their 
:x>ssession. Under a scattering of bones near the altar 
an be found a sack that holds 280 gp and a bone case 
tlat contains a spell scroll of web and a spell scroll of 
pider climb. 
--::-3. ENTRANCE TO THE DWARF-HALLS 
~he dwarves of Khundrukar once resided in private 
-ooms to the north of the great hall. When the ores 
ame through, they cut down all the dwarves they found 
and stripped the treasure out of the place. 
.,.he door opens into a large chamber with a dark pool in 
;tie center. Bits of smashed furniture and other debris are 
scattered about the floor. Hallways lead off to the east 
and the west. 
A weird moaning fills the area, slowly becoming recog­
n zable as Dwarvish curses. The sound rises to angry 
shouting and grows closer. Then the translucent form of 
an armored dwarf appears through a wall and attacks! Creature. Area 43, area 46, and all the rooms marked 
44 are now the demesne of the dwarf mage Arundil, 
who lingers as an insane ghost. 
The ghost relentlessly attacks anyone who enters its 
territory (most likely in either area 43 or area 46) but 
can't pursue characters who retreat beyond its domain. 
If the ghost is turned, it flees to one of the empty rooms 
labeled as area 44. 
Development. Arundil's ghost is tormented by grief 
and shame over abandoning his kin to die (see area 47). 
The spirit might be laid to rest if the characters can con­
vince it that they have cleansed Khundrukar. 
44. LOOTED ROOMS 
Severak chambers in the Foundry were once living 
quarters, drawing rooms, barracks, armories, store­
rooms, and so on. Now they contain only smashed fur­
niture and debris from the final battle, graffiti in the Ore 
language, and skeletal remains of dwarves and ores. 
Treasure. Here and there a remnant of something 
valuable can be salvaged from the trash. Roll a dlO the 
first time a character searches a given room; on a result 
of 10, the character uncovers a semiprecious stone (see 
the 10 gp Gemstones table in chapter 7 of the Dungeon 
Master's Guide). 
45. SKELETON ROOM 
One of the smaller chambers once served as a small 
barracks. Half a dozen dwarves perished here and were 
later animated by Arundil (see area 47). He ordered 
them to defend their post against all intruders. 
CHAPTER 2 I THE FORGE OF FURY 55 

--- PAGE 57 ---

This chamber might once have been a barracks. The 
remains of six wooden bunks lean against the walls, 
burned and hacked by pillagers, and half a dozen skeletal 
dwarves lie here and there on the floor. With clicking and 
scraping sounds, the skeletons rise and advance on you. 
Creatures. The six skeletons attack any non-undead 
creature that enters. They don't pursue anyone beyond 
this chamber. 
Treasure. The rogue from the failed expedition lies 
in this room, her desiccated corpse half-buried under 
wrecked furniture. A pouch on her belt contains 670 sp. 
46. COMMON AREA 
The open courtyard in the east end of the residen­
tial area was the site of a pitched battle between 
dwarves and ores. 
The hallway leads to a large open chamber. Three doors 
open into it, and a dark pool fills a low stone basin in its 
center. The chamber is littered with the remains of old 
warriors. Seven dwarf corpses lie where they fell a hun­
dred years ago, surrounded by the remains of at least a 
dozen ore warriors. The dead have been stripped of their 
arms and armor; only a handful of broken weapons and 
shattered shields remain. 
Creature. If the characters approach this area from 
the secret door to the south before entering area 43, 
Arundil the ghost confronts them here; refer to the en­
counter in area 43. Otherwise, there is nothing danger­
ous or valuable in the area. 
47. ARUNDIL's CHAMBERS 
Arundil, the leading mage of Khundrukar and Durged­
din's trusted advisor, lived in a spacious room close 
to the great hall. During the final assault of the ores, 
Arundil used his magic to escape the slaughter. He re­
turned to find all his kinfolk dead. Driven insane with 
grief, he tried to repair some of the complex's defenses, 
animating dead warriors and various objects to kill any 
intruders that returned. In his madness, he even sum­
moned a fiend (see area 49), and he perished at its hands 
not long after. 
This chamber must once have been the personal quar­
ters of an important dwarf. It is decorated with tapestries 
and furnished comfortably, although age has taken its 
toll on the contents. Apparently, the room has not been 
looted. A beautiful rug covers the center of the floor, 
and a simple bed and writing desk stand in the south­
west corner. 
Creature. The rug, 20 feet square, is actually a Gar­
gantuan rug of smothering that activates when any non-
CHAPTER 2 I THE FORGE OF FURY dwarf sets foot on ir. le fights until destroyed but doesn't 
attack a dwarf under any circumstances. See "Arundil's 
Animated Objects.-page 54. 
Treasure. Beneath the bed is a small wooden chest 
containing 1,200 sp. 3,000 cp, and a square of silk in 
which are wrapped a star sapphire worth 500 gp and a 
pair of matched blue topazes worth 90 gp each. 
48. LOOTED ARMORY 
Khundrukar 's armory was looted long ago. Its door is 
made of iron plates, but the lock was broken during the 
pillaging -it can be forced open with a successful DC 15 
Strength check. 
Rows of empty weapon racks and a dozen or more ar­
mor stands indicate that this room was once an armory. 
Some debris litters the floor, but nothing of value is read­
ily apparent. 
Creature. One of the armor stands is actually an 
animated object (use the animated armor stat block), 
which activates when a non-dwarf enters the room. It 
fights until destroyed. See "Arundil's Animated Ob­
jects," page 54. 
49. lDALLA'S DEN 
The mad dwarf Arundil used every magical tool at his 
disposal to protect the complex. He not only animated 
objects and the bones of the dead but called upon more 
dangerous magic in his futile attempt to make the place 
safe. In the former chambers of a dwarf scholar, tucked 
away in the eastern end of Khundrukar, he found a 
scroll that he tried to use to bind a fiend to his service. 
This room was once a library or a study. Bookshelves 
stand against the walls. Piles of books rest on a reading 
table in the middle of the room. The air reeks of moldy 
paper. Doors exit to the north, east, and south. 
A beautiful, slender woman with long black hair sits in 
a chair at the table, looking extremely sad. Her clothing, 
though well worn, does little to detract from her ap­
pearance. 
Creature. Arundil summoned a succubus and com­
manded it to guard the area that is now the domain of 
Arundil's ghost (see area 43). But the fiend easily over­
powered Arundil's will, then toyed with him cruelly until 
it finally drained his life force. 
The succubus, which calls itself Idalia, claimed the 
scholar's library for its own and spends much time here 
reading through the collected lore. It learned of Khun­
drukar's history from the scholar's records and realized 
that the legends of wondrous treasure would lure greedy 
souls. It consumed the wizard from the previous expe­
dition, who took refuge in this library after his compan­
ions were killed. Since that time, it has spread rumors 
to draw more adventurers to its lair. 

--- PAGE 58 ---

IDALLA'S STORY 
Idalia takes delight in misleading the characters . ~e ~ end 
can impart the following bits of information : 
• The wizard lives below this area. He wants to use dalla 
for a study on prolonging life. (False.) 
• The wizard told Idalia a bit of the history of Khundrukar 
and the fate of Durgeddin, which she can pass on. (The 
information is true, but the succubus learned history 
from reading the books here, not from the wizard.) 
• A doppelganger lurks in the Glitterhame. (False.) 
• A dead dwarf haunts the halls, reduced to a mad, gibber­
ing spirit. (True; this is the ghost of Arundil.) 
• An ancient dragon lairs below the Foundry. (Partly true; 
Nightscale is a young dragon.) 
Idalia takes the form of a human woman. When the 
characters enter, the fiend jumps up and begs to be re­
;eased from imprisonment. Idalia tells the characters 
that she is a captive of a wizard who resides below this 
:eve!. The succubus plays the role to the hilt, trembling 
and crying as it spins a tale of woe. It tries to split up 
the group, persuading one character to remain (using its 
Charm attack if necessary) while the others deal with 
he wizard. If they leave anyone alone with Idalia, the 
fiend attempts to kiss and drain the hapless dupe. The 
succubus is an adept liar and mixes in just enough of the 
truth to be convincing; see the "Idalia's Story" sidebar. 
If the characters attack, Idalla attempts to charm the 
most dangerous-looking character and turn him or her 
against the party while the fiend fades into the Ethereal. 
49a (Bedchamber). The adjoining room was the 
-!eeping quarters of the dwarf scholar. It is moldy and 
:ery stuffy. Anyone who looks around the room finds a 
secret compartment in one of the walls with a success­
:ul DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. 
Treasure. The dwarf scholar amassed a small amount 
of treasure, which he kept in the secret compartment: 
110 gp and a cat's-eye gem worth 70 gp. In the library, in 
addition to an extensive collection of dwarven lore, the 
characters can find four spell scrolls (of alarm, disguise 
elf, enlarge/reduce, and shield). The shelves might 
also include more scrolls, useful information tying in to 
:uture adventures, items of value to a collector, or other 
Jlteresting lore, as you see fit. 
THE BLACK LAKE 
;he darkest and most remote corner of the Glitter­
hame's cavern system, the Black Lake is a large, wind­
;ng cavern filled with water that drains from the Dark 
_.fore through a submerged siphon. From the lake, the 
subterranean river flows west through the Sinkhole, 
across the bottom of the chasm in area 3 of the Moun­
rain Door, and onward for about 5 miles until it emerges 
at the surface. 
The dwarves of Khundrukar never settled these cav­
erns, although Durgeddin had his followers begin work 
on an escape route through the depths. 
The Black Lake is now the domain of Nightscale , a 
young black dragon. Here she has built her hoard, hav­
:...'lg slowly collected most of the remaining loot from 
Khundrukar. From the lake, Nightscale can swim to the 
-inkhole, climb up to the Glitterhame, or fly up to the Foundry through the chasm there. The troglodytes fear 
and worship the dragon. The duergar have negotiated an 
uneasy truce with Nightscale, paying her a modest trib­
ute to leave them alone. 
The following locations are identified on map 2.6. 
50. THE CASCADE 
The stream in area 38 flows over the edge of the chasm 
and pours down into a turbulent pool. 
A thundering spray of water fills this chamber, pooling 
and flowing out to join a larger river to the north. The 
air is damp, and the roar of the waterfall is deafening . A 
broad ledge heads north toward the river and then turns 
out of sight to the east. The muddy bank of the pool 
looks disturbed by tracks of some kind. 
A character who makes a successful DC 10 Wisdom 
(Survival) check identifies the tracks as those of a Large 
reptilian creature with four feet and a long tail. The 
tracks lead away from the hard stone of the ledge to the 
north (where they can't be seen) and into the water. 
51. DWARVEN BRIDGES 
Durgeddin's followers built two stone bridges when they 
started work on the escape route through this level. The 
chain ladder that drops from the north ledge of area 38 
ends just above the ground in the area south of the west­
ern bridge. 
If the characters reached this area by using the chain 
ladder or otherwise descending through the chasm, 
read or paraphrase the following text. Adjust the infor­
mation as needed if they arrive here by a different route. 
A fast-moving underground river roars from east to west 
under a stone bridge. The bottom of the chain ladder is 
near the south bank of the river. On the north side of the 
bridge, a ledge continues to the east. 
If the characters go north and cross the bridge, read: 
I After a short distance, the ledge leading east bends to I 
the south, and a second bridge surmounts the river. 
The western bridge is safe, but the bridge to the east is 
not. It has settled considerably, some of its stone blocks 
leaning precariously. Also, the stone has a curiously 
pitted appearance (which was caused by Nightscale's 
acid breath). A character who succeeds on a DC 10 In­
telligence (Investigation) check can determine that the 
stone was affected by acid, although the source of the 
acid isn't apparent. 
Hazard. The weakened bridge can't take much weight 
before it collapses. If more than one Small or larger 
creature is on the bridge at one time, or if a character in 
heavy armor steps onto it, the arch fails. Any creature 
on the span must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving 
CHAPTER 2 I THE FORGE OF FURY 57 

--- PAGE 59 ---

MAP 2.G: THE BLACK LAKE 
throw to catch itself on the ledge. On a failed save, a 
creature falls, takes 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage from 
falling timbers and stones, and is caught in the river's 
current (see "Fast-Flowing Water," page 51). 
52. NIGHTSCALE 'S LAIR 
When the characters first approach the southeastern 
shore of the lake, Nightscale is dozing on her hoard on 
the island (area 53). The dragon is immediately alerted 
to their presence if the characters make noise, carry 
light sources, or trigger the collapse of the bridge. Oth­
erwise, the characters don't draw the dragon's attention 
unless they move all the way to the ledge directly south 
of area 53. 
The dilapidated bridge leads to another ledge that winds 
southeast alongside a very large lake, apparently the 
source of the underground river. The cavern is quite 
large; the lake's far shore is lost in shadow, and the 
echoes of water seem to indicate a very sizable cave. 
Creature. When Nightscale becomes aware of intrud­
ers, the young black dragon slips into the water, quietly 
swimming to a point near the three stepping stones 
shown on the map. Any character watching the lake 
can make a Wisdom (Perception) check contested by 
the dragon's Dexterity (Stealth) check. On a successful 
check, the character catches a glimpse of a serpentine 
form moving in the darkness. 
The dragon takes full advantage of her aquatic envi­
ronment and never offers an easy target to enemies. She 
begins combat at a range of 20 to 30 feet, raising only 
her head and part of her neck above the water (granting 
her three-quarters cover) and breathing acid. Then she 
submerges and waits for her breath weapon to recharge. 
Nightscale doesn't resort to melee combat unless she is 
confronted underwater. If the dragon is reduced to 40 
CHAPTER 2 I THE FORGE OF FURY hit points or fewer, she tries to escape through the pas­
sage in area 54. 
Negotiation. Nightscale isn't inclined to parley with 
the characters unless they surrender, give her all of 
their treasure, and throw their arms and armor in the 
lake. If the characters seriously injure her, Nightscale 
might bargain to buy time so she can later move her 
hoard. Only when she is near death does she abandon 
her treasure. 
53. NIGHTSCALE 'S HOARD 
When the characters come into view of the island for the 
first time, read: 
A short distance offshore sits a small isle thirty or forty 
feet across. Stalagmites thrust up at the ceiling above, 
and the dark waters lap quietly at its shores. Several 
spots on its surface glimmer even in the gloom, suggest­
ing the promise of treasure to be had. 
Nightscale keeps her treasure on the small island in the 
lake, and she spends most of her time resting here. If 
the characters have avoided attracting her attention so 
far and want to approach the island, they can do so qui­
etly if every character's Dexterity (Stealth) check meets 
or exceeds the dragon's passive Perception score. 
Treasure. Nightscale has accumulated considerable 
wealth from her plunder of Khundrukar. Her hoard con­
tains 6,200 sp, 1,430 gp, two garnets worth 20 gp each, 
a black pearl worth 50 gp, a wand of magic missiles, 
a +2 greataxe bearing Durgeddin's smith-mark, a +l 
shield, a potion of healing, and a potion of flying. 
54. THE DRAGON'S PASSAGE 
Beneath the surface of a small pool is an underwater 
passage that links the Black Lake to the Dark Mere on 
the east side of the Stone Tooth. The submerged pas­
sage is about 700 feet long. 

--- PAGE 60 ---

_-\.FTERMATH 
-e characters have overcome Khundrukar's dangerous 
habitants and looted the dragon's lair. What next? 
RESOLVING THE CHARACTER HOOKS 
-the characters return to Blasingdell, their fame as 
a venturers spreads. Townsfolk hail them on the street, 
and some might approach them with problems that 
an lead to further adventures. The characters can 
ontinue to use the town as a base of operations. Other 
evelopments depend on what got them here and how 
ey leave. 
':""OLLOWTHE MAP 
:hile the characters are exploring the stronghold, they 
1ght find another map, perhaps on the body of an ad-
enturer from the previous expedition, or in the library 
area 49. It could lead to a different dungeon, a city in 
: me land far away, or an as-yet-unknown location ru­
_ored to hide a fabulous treasure. 
~RACK THE BROKEN BLADE 
the characters were sent to retrieve weapons for 
3aron Althon, they can bring him the +l longsword 
-om area 22, the +2 greataxe in area 53, the handaxe 
om area 14, and the warhammer from area 23. All 
ear Durgeddin's smith-mark; Baron Althon pays 500 
:P above the market price for each mundane weapon, 
· 000 gp for the +1 longsword, and 6,000 gp for the +2 
~~eataxe, if the characters are willing to sell. VANQUISH THE 0RC RAIDERS 
The characters can return to Blasingdell at any time 
to collect the bounty for ores they kill or capture. If the 
characters eliminate all the ores in the stronghold, the 
mayor honors them with a celebration attended by the 
eminent citizens of the town. The characters have estab­
lished valuable contacts who can aid them in their later 
endeavors. 
FURTHER ADVENTURES 
You can build an entire campaign around the duergar 
that occupy the Foundry. Perhaps they came here from 
a hidden city in even deeper caverns beneath the Sink­
hole and the Black Lake. Your answers to the following 
questions form the basis for further adventures: 
• How did the duergar get into the complex? 
• What is the mysterious project they are working on? 
• Did Durgeddin know of the duergar's existence? 
• Do the duergar have some of Durgeddin's items? If so, 
are they guarding them or using them? 
You can also use this adventure to sow the seeds of the 
characters' next activity. Perhaps the party encounters 
a legend of a magical treasure from Khundrukar's fall, 
buried in the tomb of an evil knight. Maybe Great Ulfe's 
ogre clan is terrorizing a nearby area, or an ore war 
chief wields a legendary weapon that was crafted by 
Durgeddin. 
Whatever form they take, the repercussions of the 
characters' descent into Khundrukar have the potential 
to affect their lives for years to come. ~ 
CHAPTER 2 I THE FORGE OF FURY 59

THE HIDDEN SHRINE OF TAMOACHAN 
a, HE ANCIENT RUINED CITY OF TAMOACHA'.\ 
is familiar to a select few scholars and 
fortune seekers, who know of it but not 
always exactly where it is. Even more 
secluded, lying somewhere within or be­
neath the ruins, is a hidden shrine said to 
be dedicated to Zotzilaha, the vampire god 
~ the underworld. Adventurers who catch wind of the 
ace are likely to find its lure irresistible. 
If the characters find their way to the environs of the 
:uined city, their next order of business might be to 
:et up a camp nearby. After a few hours of searching, 
hey can find an easily defended glade with an arte-
;,· an spring. 
~fost of the city is toppled and almost completely 
overed in undergrowth. Intruders who enter the ruins 
-II discover that the ancient streets now serve as over­
,,rown "valleys" between the debris of the crumbled 
· ildings. The largest of these valleys all lead to the cen­
-al clearing where a great pyramid stands. 
In the south side of that clearing is a newly collapsed 
rea, revealing a jagged hole with a debris-covered slide, 
ading down into darkness. 
RUNNING THE ADVENTURE 
:-. e adventure, which is designed for a group of four 
-five 5th-level player characters, gets under way the 
orning after the characters arrive in the vicinity of the 
ins and make camp. When all of them have risen and 
nished preparing for the day's travel, read: 
.!,s you head toward the pyramid temple, you tread across 
cracked and overgrown flagstones, stepping over fallen 
a'ld shattered pillars, pushing aside vines and briars. 
When you are nearly at the temple, the sound of crea­
-ures crashing through the underbrush comes from be-

THE RUINS OF THE SHRINE 
'ap 3.1 shows the layout of the shrine, and later 
_ections of this adventure describe what can be 
und there. THE RUINS: GENERAL FEATURES 
The walls inside the ruins are constructed of blocks of 
unmortared stone covered by stucco. The ceilings are of 
the same material, supported by corbel arches. 
Ceilings. Most of the hallways have 20-foot ceilings. 
Some rooms have ceilings of 20 to 40 feet in height. 
Doors. Doors are made of beaten bronze or slabs of 
stone. While heavy, they can be opened without a check. 
Unsafe Stonework. In some places, the corbel arches 
that hold up the ceiling aren't structurally sound. As a 
result, some spells might have disastrous effects. A spell 
like fireball (an explosion) or thunderwave (an area of 
thunder damage) has a 25 percent chance to cause a 
ceiling collapse within the spell's area, dealing 16 (3d10) 
bludgeoning damage to creatures in the area. This col­
lapse might block or bury objects or exits. 
Poisonous Gas. The lower levels of the ruins, in­
cluding the rooms and passages of encounter areas 1 
through 38, are filled with poisonous gas. The gas is an 
amber color, and its area is lightly obscured. Anyone can 
tell that the gas is irritating, but it takes a successful DC 
15 Intelligence (Nature) check to discern the gas's toxic­
ity. Flames in the gas sputter and glow redly, and any at­
tempt to use natural means to ignite a fire has only a 50 
percent chance of success. Fire used as a light source 
has an effective radius only half normal. 
A creature takes 3 (ld6) poison damage every hour 
it spends in the gas. The gas is light, so it accumulates 
closer to the ceiling. Inhabitants of the dungeon have 
immunity to the poisonous effect of the gas. 
PLACING THE ADVENTURE 
In the original adventure, set in the world ofGreyhawk, the 
Hidden Shrine is part of the ancient ruined city ofTamoa­
chan, once the northernmost capital of the Olman empire. 
The civilization of the Olman people covered much of 
the southern continent centuries before current history 
began. Tamoachan is located in the savage lands south of 
the Olman Islands and southeast of the Holds of the Sea 
Princes. The climate is subtropical and very damp; it rains 
nearly every afternoon . 
In other worlds, similar possibilities can be found. 
Dragonlance. The hidden shrine might not be part of an 
ancient city on Krynn, but instead an isolated temple for 
a weird dead cult devoted to the god Chemosh. The site 
could date back to the Age of Dreams, and might be on an 
isle or in an isolated region near the Blood Sea of I star. 
Eberron. On Eberron, the site might be the ancient seat 
of an elven cult, possibly connected to the line of Vol. Al­
ternatively, Tamoachan could be a truly primeval location 
in Q'barra, and the Olman "gods" actually fiends from the 
Age of Demons. 
Forgotten Realms. Because the people of Maztica closely 
resemble the Olman, that region is a likely place for the 
ruined city and the shrine. Tamoachan might instead be a 
lost city in the jungles of Ch ult.

The gas rises up and out of the ruins if the doors to 
area 39 are opened. It takes one month for the lower lev­
els to clear completely. If the doors are closed again, the 
lower chambers refill with gas in two weeks. 
Dried Potions. In some locations, characters discover 
the remains of a potion in the form of sediment in the 
bottom of a container. It is possible to mix this powder 
with water or wine and restore the potion. Wine creates 
a potion with full effect, but water shortens the potion's 
duration (if it has one) by half. If the powder is con­
sumed by itself, there is a 1 in 8 chance that it acts as a 
potion of poison; otherwise , the powder has no effect. 
Pressure Plates. Several areas have traps that are 
triggered by the operation of a pressure plate, which de­
presses when a certain amount of weight is put on it. 
A character who succeeds on a DC 20 Wisdom (Per­
ception) check can find a pressure plate. The plate can 
be blocked, preventing the trap from triggering , by 
wedging it in the upper position with pitons or similarly 
strong shims. Doing so takes one character at least 5 
minutes, and the character must make a DC 15 Dex­
terity check using thieves' tools. If the check fails by 4 
or less, the character knows the shims aren't properly 
placed. If the check fails by 5 or more, the character 
doesn't realize the shims will fail to hold up the plate.

situation, check again or choose a different result. 
LOCATIONS IN THE LOWER 
CHAMBERS 
The following locations are identified on map 3.1. 
1. THE VAULT OF CHICOMOZTOC 
(Chee-koh-MOZ-tok, the place of seven caves) 
The poisonous gas is present here, affecting fire and 
breathing. 
Relate the following information to the characters 
gradually as they examine their surroundings . 
You are in a long, narrow chamber, running east-west. 
In the center of this apartment is a domed shape on the 
floor. In the east wall is a blank-faced stone door. The 
west end of the room is blocked by fallen stone and rub· 
ble, apparently the result of a collapse. The two side walls 
appear to have several niches cut into them. 
The shape in the center of the chamber appears to be a 
small alcove, protected by a half-dome with the open end 
facing toward the door in the east wall. This alcove is set 
in a recessed, shallow, tiled well, one foot deep and ten 
feet wide. The alcove itself is four feet high. The recess 
contains some sort of display. 
The display appears to be a diorama depicting a hunt· 
ing party of Olman warriors, in feathers and deer-hide 
garments, in a mountainside scene. Some have pulled 
down a stag with the aid of a dog, another group is clean­
ing a small mule deer, and others have cornered a pan­
ther with their spears. A scout watches the panther from 
an outcropping above. He holds a metal staff with a loop 
in its end. It looks like a shepherd's crook. 
The three niches on both the northern and southern 
walls are five feet wide and about three feet off the floor. 
The Hidden Shrine ofTamoachan , by 
Harold Johnson and Jeff R. Leason, 
was originally published in 1980 as 
an adventure for the first edition of 
the D&D game. 
The design of the temple draws 
heavily on Mayan and Aztec/Toltec mythology and society. In the orig· 
inal publication , Dungeon Masters 
were encouraged to research these 
real-world background elements to 
add depth and realism to the char· 
acters' experience. 
CHAPTER 3 I THE HIDDEN SHRINE OF TAMOACHAN 

--- PAGE 66 ---

Each niche contains a diorama depicting so e ;;s:e:: 
of tribal life. The six-inch-tall figures in a· o' • e : s::i a s 
appear to be made of stucco, realistica1 ly a d ::i 5 ; 
painted. The scenes portrayed represent fis I g 'a•::, "g 
religion, warfare, the creation story, and crafting. 
A cave-in completely blocks the west end oft e c am­
ber. At short intervals, small amounts of rubble and dirt 
come spilling into the room. Several large stones appear 
to have wedged themselves tightly, closing the collapse. 
The figures of people and animals in all of the dioramas 
are loose and can be picked up and manipulated . If any 
of the people, and some of the animals, are removed 
·rom a display and placed on the floor of this vault, 
·he item grows to full-size dimensions immediately, 
and spirits of the ancestors animate the creature and 
it attacks. These beings are constructs, but otherwise 
unction according to the statistics for a certain kind of 
creature, as noted below. 
Center Display. The diorama in the alcove holds 
welve tribal warriors, one scout, a mastiff, and a pan­
ther. The deer don't animate. 
Niche A. In a river scene, a dozen commoners gather 
~ushes, fish with nets, and carve a dugout. 
Niche B. Twelve commoners are engaged in farming, 
planting maize and harvesting wheat. Five tribal war­
riors stand guard, and a cult fanatic (priest) in a bird 
ostume is blessing the fields. 
Niche C. The display portrays a temple upon a tiered 
pyramid. Seven commoners are bringing small offer­
_ngs of gold and jade. Before the temple stands a cult 
fanatic handling a constrictor snake. Around him 
·tand three costumed tribal warriors. One, dressed as 
a winged serpent, holds a spear; another is dressed as 
a bear with razor claws; the third represents a coyote 
holding a torch. There are also several stone statues of 
·he gods. The bits of gold and jade are worth 5 gp each, 
and there are fifteen such items. 
Niche D. A scene of tribal warfare involves twenty 
tribal warriors in combat. The ten warriors of one side 
are painted black, while the ten others are done in red. 
'\'arriors that are animated will fight animated enemy 
•:arriors first, but once they vanquish their foes they 
·urn on the characters. 
Niche E. In the display that depicts the creation of 
he world, all the statuettes are stylized and obviously 
nonhuman. These figures can be removed, but they 
don't animate. A god, adorned in green quetzal feathers, 
mixing ashes with blood to form sculptures of a man 
and woman, while four towering figures painted red, 
black, blue, and white are standing about a fire com­
mitting suicide with their daggers. Two smaller figures 
are ringed by the four-the modest "Pimply One" is 
being consumed by the fire, while the braggart "Lord of 
-nails" cowers in fear. 
Niche F. In a scene that shows various forms of craft­
ng, twelve commoners are busy weaving rugs and bas­
.·ets, carving totems, making pots, grinding stones for 
,·eapons, and making clothes. Treasure. The staff held by the scout figure in the 
central diorama is actually a key and may be separated 
from the figure without affecting it. The key (worth 2 gp) 
is used to open the door to this room. 
Cave-In. Attempting to dig upward through the rubble 
in the west end of the room results only in more detritus 
falling into the area. 
Any further collapse deals 2 (ld4) bludgeoning dam­
age to each digger. Each digger must also succeed on 
a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be buried by the 
rubble and take another 7 (3d4) bludgeoning damage. If 
the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the rubble engulfs 
the digger completely, and the trapped character can't 
breathe until dug out. Struggling out on one's own re­
quires a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check, 
and doing so takes 1 minute. 
Door. When the characters investigate the door that 
offers an exit from the chamber, read: 
The door is carved with a sun symbol and appears to 
open into the room; there are hinges on this side and 
scratches on the floor. There is no visible lock or handle 
on it, although a slight gap stretches across the top of 
the door. Eight holes seem to have been bored into the 
door; they are about an inch in diameter, but nothing can 
be seen in them. The door seems to be fairly thick. The 
lintel is arched, with a keystone at the top. 
This door can be opened in a number of ways. 
The key found in the diorama about hunting can be 
used to spring the door open when it is turned in the 
keyhole hidden under the keystone over the door. The 
keyhole can be found with a successful DC 20 Wisdom 
(Perception) check. 
CHAPTER 3 I THE HIDDEN SHRINE OF TAMOAGHAN 

--- PAGE 67 ---

66 Pitons or similar tools can be driven into the door to 
provide handles. Driving pitons into the door takes 1 
minute and requires a successful DC 10 Strength check. 
With such a grip, the door can be opened with some 
force, but with no check needed. (Objects inserted into 
the holes that are already bored won't stay in the door.) 
The two hinge pins can be broken (each has AC 12 
and 20 hit points) and removed, but the door falls in­
ward. Someone who holds the door and succeeds on a 
DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check can keep the door up 
and lower it to the floor. Otherwise, the door falls, and 
those within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Dex­
terity saving throw to avoid the falling door. On a failed 
save, a creature takes 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage. 
2. THE HALL OF THRASHING CANES 
l The stone walls of this corridor are carved to resemble 
a stack of bamboo-like logs. The passage slopes down 
from a single door on its western leg, the lintel of which 
has been crafted to represent a stylized cavern entrance. 
It leads to double doors of beaten bronze, worked to re­
semble a forest of seaweed. l 
Pressure Plate. There is a pressure plate halfway 
down the hallway that triggers a trap when weight equiv­
alent to that of three or four humanoids is on it. See 
"The Ruins: General Features" at the beginning of the 
adventure for details about pressure plates. 
If the trap triggers, several of the logs swing out from 
either wall and buffet the party. Those in the plate's area 
when the trap triggers take 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage 
and are pushed 5 feet down the slope toward the double 
doors. Once they swing out, the stone logs don't swing 
back and thus effectively block the passage, since they 
bar the way from ceiling to floor with only a 6-inch gap 
remaining between the logs. 
3. ROOST OF THE CONCH 
This room is constructed of large stone blocks, but­
tressed in the corners. The walls are wet and slimy, and 
mud covers most of the floor in a thin coating. To the 
east and west may be seen stone doors recessed in the 
wall, and to the north a set of stairs leads down. 
In the center of the chamber sits a large polished 
boulder amid a pile of smaller rounded rocks. The boul­
der is five feet tall and colored brown with dark streaks 
and spots. Leaning against it is what appears to be a 
bamboo staff. 
In the mud around the base of the boulder is a moving 
shape, looking like a crayfish. It is facing you and seems 
to be aware of your presence. 
Slippery Mud. The floor of the chamber is very slip­
pery, counting as difficult terrain. Any sudden actions, 
including those necessary for combat, may result in the 
CHAPTER 3 I THE HI ODEN SH RINE OF TAMOAGHAN character taking a pill. A character who uses the Dash 
action or tries to fight within the room must succeed on 
a DC 10 Dexterity a\·ing throw or fall prone. The saving 
throw should be made before attacks are made. Crea­
tures encountered here are unaffected by the mud. 
Guardian. The creature at the base of the boulder is 
a giant crayfish see appendix B). If it is approached, it 
will advance waving its claws in an aggressive manner 
and speak. If any member of the party can understand 
Olman, an ancient language, the crayfish will be heard 
to say, "Who is this? Who dares to enter the chamber 
of the guardian? You had better go, or I will have to 
discharge my sacred duty! Be off with you before I lose 
my temper!" 
If the party retreats, the crayfish will not follow, but 
will take to marching back and forth in front of the 
boulder and will continue to threaten the party if they 
approach again. If the crayfish is attacked, it will imme­
diately call forth its companion. 
Creature. The boulder is in reality a huge shell in­
habited by Kalka-Kylla (see appendix B), a giant hermit 
crab. The bamboo staff is one of its legs; a successful 
DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) check enables a character to 
discern this fact and get a hint as to Kalka-Kylla's nature 
before the crab moves. 
When the characters enter the room, Kalka-Kylla 
is asleep and will not awaken unless the crayfish is 
attacked. Once it is awake, it may attack or bargain. It 
speaks Olman. 
The crab can be reasoned with, if the party doesn't 
attack it and can come to terms with it. The crab denies 
any knowledge of this place, stating that it was brought 
into these warrens when very young. If asked for direc­
tions, it first sends the party to the rubble-filled staircase 
to the east, and then, if asked a second time, it sends the 
party to the west. 
4. Mun-FILLED DOORWAY 
Southern Approach. If the characters come upon the 
doorway from the south, read: 
The landing at the foot of a short flight of steps is filled 
with mud and silt that partially blocks the door leading 
north. The door is meant to open inward, for there are 
hinges on this side and a large grip to pull on. 
Any attempts to open the door will meet with failure un­
til the blockage is removed. Probing the silt will reveal 
its depth to be about 18 to 24 inches and its consistency 
as tenacious as quicksand. The silt can be scooped out 
of the stairwell, but it is semi-liquid and will quickly flow 
back. If water is forced, in quantity, through the silt, it 
will wash the silt under the door jamb and down the hall 
beyond, alleviating the blockage. 
Northern Approach. If the characters come upon the 
doorway from the north, read: 
I The thin, muddy stream that trickles through the hallway I 
here flows out from underneath the door that lies ahead. 

--- PAGE 68 ---

The door can be forced open only a fev.: inches enough 
to see it is blocked on the other side by a mass o: 
5. TOMB STONE AND WET LIME 
• 
The walls of this corridor are wet and slimy. The s ucco 
covering has become saturated with water and ·s decom­
posing and sloughing off in spots on the southern wall, 
exposing the seams of one of the large stone blocks from 
which this structure was built. 
The tightly fitted stone seals off a tomb. The block is 
made of limestone, and the entire face of the plug is cov­
ered with wet, caustic lime. 
Wet Lime. Any flesh that comes in contact with the 
lime will take 1 acid damage per round. The lime must 
be removed from the skin to stop the damage, and it can 
either be wiped off or washed away. 
If cloth or soft leather is used to protect flesh from 
contact with the wet lime, the lime will soak through 
tn 2 rounds. Nonmagical leather armor won't absorb 
·he lime, but each hour of contact with it reduces the 
armor's AC by 1, making the armor useless if its AC 
becomes 10. The lime can't be removed from the stone, 
since it isn't a coating. 
Moving the Block. After the stucco is scraped away 
-rom the seams, the block can be pushed inward by the 
combined effort of up to four characters with a total 
-rrength of 48 or higher. The stone is about 6 feet tall, 3 
-eet wide, and 3 feet thick. It takes 1 minute to push the 
plug 10 feet, after which it can be circumvented. 
6. RUBBLE-FILLED STAIRCASE 
This staircase goes up for only a few steps, and then it 
seems that the rest is filled in with clay and stone rubble. 
One or more characters can try to dig this staircase out. 
Any digging, however, will result in further movement of 
:he rubble, dealing 2 (ld4) bludgeoning damage to each 
digger. Each digger must also succeed on a DC 13 Dex­
-erity saving throw or be buried by the rubble, taking an­
other 7 (3d4) bludgeoning damage. If the saving throw 
·ails by 5 or more, the rubble engulfs the digger com­
pletely, and the trapped character can't breathe until dug 
out. Struggling out on one's own requires 1 minute of ef­
:ort and a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. 
The staircase is completely blocked and leads nowhere. 
-. THE SEPULCHER OF TLOQUES- POPOLOCAS 
Tloh-kays Poh-poh-LOH-kahs, master of the outsiders) 
Once the stone entrance block (area 5) is pushed out of 
die way, the characters have enough space to get past it. 
Beyond the plug is a small foyer holding three sealed 
urns on the east and west sides. To the south are double 
doors of bronze with glyphs worked into their faces. The ancient glyphs are scribed in Olman. If anyone in 
the party can read this language, or if the message can 
be understood by other means, the glyphs will translate 
as "Here lies Tloques-Popolocas, master of the others, 
who is like the wind and the night!" 
Trapped Doors. The doors are locked (DC 15 Dexter­
ity check to pick with thieves' tools) and trapped. Open­
ing the lock disables the trap. Forcing the doors open 
can be done with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athlet­
ics) check, but the act causes a glass sphere on the other 
side of the doors to break. This sphere is attached to the 
doors just above the lock, and opening the lock pushes 
the sphere aside, putting it out of harm's way. 
Someone who examines the door closely with a light 
source notices the glint of glass in the seam between 
the doors with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) 
check. Even with the lock still in place, the lever on 
which the sphere rests can be moved by someone who 
succeeds on a DC 20 Dexterity check using thieves' 
tools. The painstaking process in the narrow space 
takes 5 minutes, and if the check fails by 5 or more, the 
sphere breaks at the end of the attempt. 
Sleep Gas. If the glass sphere breaks, it releases 
green, swirling sleep gas throughout the area. Each 
time a creature ends its turn in this chamber , the crea­
ture must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving 
throw or become poisoned for 5,000 years. While poi­
soned in this way, a creature is also unconscious, and it 
is unaffected by the passage of time or by other poisons. 
If magic is used to cure the poisoned condition, the re­
cipient is immune to the poison for 1 hour. A casting of 
dispel magic using a spell slot of 7th level or higher can 
CHAPTER 3 I THE HIDDEN SHRINE OF TAMOACHAN 

--- PAGE 69 ---

68 also end the effect. The vapors linger for a month unless 
they are cleared away by a strong wind. 
Treasure. The seal on the urns is made of beeswax 
and may be broken so that the lids can be removed. 
Each of the six urns contains the equivalent of twenty 
flasks of oil. A filled urn weighs 25 pounds. 
Behind the doors is a chamber cut out of the rock with 
a veil of calcite and stalactites covering the walls. But­
tresses rise from the corners, brown shot through with 
black, and triangular stone pillars support the high ceil­
ing. Occupying the center of the chamber is a colossal 
monument resembling a giant's table, covered on all 
sides with intricate carvings and glyphs. Engraved on the 
floor in front of the entrance is a seal that displays more 
glyphs. Opposite the entrance, a battleaxe is embedded 
in the wall, six feet above the floor. 
The glyphs in the floor seal are written in Olman and 
translate as "Ah, defilers! Now you shall join me in my 
eternal resting!" 
The monument is constructed from several parts. A 
great stone slab, 20 feet Jong by 10 feet wide, rests upon 
a 4-foot-thick monolith of rock of similar dimensions, 
and this, in turn, is supported by six huge blocks of 
dolomite. Every component has been covered with in­
tricate carvings and glyphs. The top of the slab depicts 
a struggle between a dark-skinned man and a mighty, 
knotted serpent. 
Engraved alongside this illustration are glyphs iden­
tical to those found on the door. Under these sigils are 
etched a series of four face-glyphs in a line. At the foot 
of the slab is a row of eleven of these symbols, all differ­
ent in form. 
The carved block is the resting place of Tloques-Po­
polocas, a servant of the shadow-loving Zotzilaha. The 
glyphs on the top of the slab give his name, and the date 
he died, 54-3-9, is written in the face-glyphs. One glyph 
is a glyph of warding (save DC 17), which casts bestow 
curse on everyone in the tomb if the crypt is opened by 
those who don't serve the god Zotzilaha. The curse lasts 
until it is dispelled, and 4dl0 days after this tomb has 
been broken into, every cursed violator receives a visit 
from either Tloques or some other agent of Zotzilaha 
seeking retribution. 
The eleven face-glyphs at the foot of the block corre­
spond to the numbers O through 10. The tomb is opened 
by pressing the glyphs that correspond to the numbers 
of the date carved on the top, in order. When the 9 glyph 
is depressed, a grating sound issues forth and the top 
slab slides back a bit. The tomb lid can then be opened 
the rest of the way by the combined effort of one or two 
characters with a total Strength of 20 or higher. 
The block beneath the slab is hollow, and inside is a 
crumbling skeleton decked out in decayed finery. It ap­
pears to have been a man of taller than average stature, 
CHAPTER 3 I THE HIDDEN SHRINE OF TAMOACHAN obviously of grea~ ~:iortance. Gems and other small 
adornments o" OD o s value lie on and around the body. 
Covering t es 111s a mask of jade with cowrie-shell eyes 
and obsrd an puo1 s. Aoout the corpse's neck is a jade 
pendant car ed with the face of a humanlike bat. 
Creature. The corpse is the body of Tloques-Popolo­
cas, a vampire spawn with special qualities (see below). 
If the characters examine the contents of the tomb, 
see "Treasure" for details. Any of the items can be lifted 
off or out if the characters so desire. If the mask and the 
pendant are both removed, Tloques starts to awaken. 
Dust is stirred up into clouds and begins to gather on 
the bones as they knit back together. His wasted form 
then sits up and gazes about. This part of the regenera­
tion process requires 2 rounds, during which time the 
corpse has AC 12 and 27 hit points. (If they have not 
been removed, the corpse benefits from the bracers of 
defense and the ring of protection he is wearing; see 
"Treasure.") If either the mask or the pendant is forced 
back upon him before the 2 rounds elapse, he returns 
to death. If not, he then sits for 2 more rounds, while his 
flesh knits and swells out with the apparent vigor of the 
living. He gains 27 hit points in the first round and 28 
hit points in the second round, and he has his normal 
AC of 17 but remains prone. He can use Multiattack to 
make two claw attacks in either of these rounds, but 
being prone, he does so with disadvantage. Within this 
period, if both the mask and the pendant are forced 
back on him, he can resist returning to death with a suc­
cessful DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. When he is whole 
again, he attacks. 
Tloques, having gained his power from his allegiance 
to Zotzilaha, isn't a typical vampire and doesn't bite. He 
has the Shapechanger trait of a true vampire, except he 
can't change into mist. Tloques also has the Children 
of the Night action option of a true vampire, but he calls 
only bats. He can innately cast the hold person spell at 
will, requiring no components, but his target must be 
able to see him. When he has a chance to do so, Tloques 
pulls his axe from the wall and then uses it for each of 
his two attacks per round. 
He is a blood-drinker and attempts to subdue oppo­
nents, if not vastly outnumbered, so as to assure himself 
a constant supply of blood. To drink blood, Tloques must 
first drain it into a receptacle and then drink it, which 
can reduce the target's hit point maximum as a normal 
vampire spawn bite does. 
Tloques will not pursue fleeing grave robbers from 
his tomb immediately, but instead will seek to regain his 
bearings in the world of the Jiving for several days. He 
can track down cursed thieves later, or invoke the power 
of Zotzilaha to locate any treasure stolen from this 
place. In the intervening time, he might regain some of 
his former power. 
Battleaxe. The battleaxe has a blade of bronze, and 
the haft is wound with snakeskin wrappings. The 
weapon detects as magical. It casts an ominous shadow 
in the shape of what appears to be a withered arm. 

--- PAGE 70 ---

Those who approach within reach of it feel a c _d chill 
run up and down their spine, and anyone who es o 
pull the axe from the wall finds it impos ible o do o. 
The weapon is a berserker axe that has a -1 bonus to 
attack and damage rolls instead of the normal -1. The 
axe can't be picked up by another as long as it current 
owner, Tloques, remains alive. Concealed beneath the 
wrappings around the handle is a parchment containing 
the spells pass wall, burning hands, and gust of wind. 
When the attuned wielder uses an action to say the cor­
rect words of power, which are engraved in Olman on 
the axe blade, one of these spells can be cast. 
The axe has 12 charges and regains ld6 + 4 expended 
charges daily at dawn. Casting a spell from it takes a 
number of charges equal to the level at which the spell 
is cast (5th for passwall , 2nd for gust of wind, and 1st 
or higher for burning hands; spell save DC 15). If the 
parchment is removed from the axe, the axe loses the 
capability of casting these spells forever. 
Treasure. The mask has a value of 200 gp, and the 
pendant is worth 50 gp. Describe the other contents 
of the tomb if the characters examine portions of the 
corpse more closely: 
Beneath the mask are fragments of bone, as though 
the skull has been crushed. Within the fragments of 
the jaw is a spherical white onyx (15 gp). 
Strands of hair still remain on the skull, gathered into 
black obsidian and red pipestone tubes (worth 50 gp 
as a bunch). 
Above the mask, on the corpse's forehead , is a diadem 
of dark opals and jade discs (worth 200 gp). 
To either side of the mask are jade earplugs carved in 
several pieces to resemble budding flowers (the pair 
worth 30 gp). 
Draped over the rib cage is a breastplate made of 
loops of tubular jade interspersed with bone dividers 
(protects like studded leather, worth 200 gp). 
Scattered around the neck and through the rib cage of 
the corpse are one hundred fifty-six jade beads (each 
worth 1 gp) shaped like spheres, cylinders, tri-lobed 
beads, floral buds, open flowers, pumpkins, melons, 
and a snake's head. 
About the wrists are wide jade bead bracelets (bracers 
of defense). 
On the middle finger of each hand are carved jade 
rings, one in the form of a man holding the moon (a 
ring of resistance [fire]) and the other a panther ready 
to strike (a ring of animal influence). 
Pressed into the fingers of each hand is a large bead, 
a jade cube (150 gp) in the right hand and a spherical 
agate (50 gp) in the left hand. 
At the feet of the skeleton lie two small containers, ap­
parently of glazed clay, one fitted with flower-shaped 
plugs in both ends (it contains the dried remains of a 
potion of invisibility) , the other holding a 1-inch-diame­
ter piece of mother-of-pearl (5 gp). 
Lying among the hip bones is a 6-inch-long statue of a 
faceless man with large pointed ears. Plugged at the 
bottom, it is a bottle that contains an elixir of health. 8. COURSES OF THE GODS 
This room is wet, and the walls are covered with a slimy, 
white buildup. There is about an inch and a half of water 
and mud blanketing the floor. Many overturned pedestals 
and pieces of broken statuary lie on the floor, partially 
buried in the mud. Opposite the entrance to this room is 
another door. 
Only one pedestal remains standing, in the northwest 
corner. On it sits a small, metallic, three-sided pyramid. 
Overhead in the shadow-draped ceiling are inlaid colored 
tiles depicting a starry sky and forming strange patterns 
in the areas above the pedestals. 
A dark, wet mass clings to the wall above the western 
door. Upon closer inspection, it appears to be green 
in color. The mass is a large colony of algae, though it 
resembles green slime; a successful DC 15 intelligence 
(Nature) check enables a character to tell the differ­
ence. Fire will have little effect on it, because the algae 
is oozing wet and fire doesn't burn with much vigor in 
the presence of the poisonous gas that fills this level. 
Attempts to dislodge the slime will result in slippery sec­
tions of it dropping on the characters. 
Caustic Lime. The walls of this room are heavily 
coated with caustic lime. Any flesh that comes in contact 
with this lime will take 1 acid damage per round. The 
lime must be removed from the skin to stop the damage, 
and can be either wiped off or washed away. 
Treasure. The small pyramid is made of silver (worth 
5 gp). It represents the god of the moon and lightning, 
Apocatequil (A-poe-ka-TAY-kel). The fallen statuary 
was made of stucco and depicted other Olman gods. 
These include a coyote, a crab-headed figure, an alliga­
tor-headed god, a feathered warrior, and a jaguar. 
9. STONE STATUE 
The walls and ceiling of this hallway are coated with 
slime, and the floor of the passage is covered with a layer 
of mud. Through this muck a steady stream of water 
trickles northward. The stucco on the walls is flaking off, 
and there are glowing silver tracks in the slime crisscross­
ing the walls and ceiling. 
Along the east wall of the passage stands a twelve­
foot-tall stone statue of a man outfitted in fine clothing 
and holding a stone tray in his raised arms. Its eyes ap­
pear to be black gemstones; the right one droops out of 
its socket, balancing on the statue's cheek. From behind 
the left shoulder protrudes the hilt of a weapon, most 
likely a sword. The stone tray, as well as the forehead and 
the nose of the statue, are chipped and scratched. 
CHAPTER 3 I THE HIDDEN SHRINE OF TAMOACHAN 69 

--- PAGE 71 ---

The easiest way to reach the sword or the gems is to 
climb up on the statue and stand on the tray. A character 
who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) 
check realizes the statue is top-heavy; proficiency with 
mason's tools and a dwarf's Stonecunning trait apply 
to this check. If a weight of more than 100 pounds is 
applied to the tray, or someone pushes on the statue 
anywhere above the tray and succeeds on a DC 10 
Strength check, the statue overbalances and topples 
into the hall. Anyone on the statue, or under it, must suc­
ceed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 7 (2d6) 
bludgeoning damage from the falling statue. Behind the 
toppled statue is a narrow passage 4 feet above the floor 
(see area 10). 
Treasure. The eyes of the statue are pieces of pol­
ished obsidian worth 10 gp each. The sword is a +I long­
sword in fine condition, made of laminated wood, inset 
with jagged teeth of obsidian. It deals an extra 2d6 dam­
age to any creature of the plant type. The sword comes 
free easily, if any character pulls it up and out. 
10. SECRET PASSAGE 
Water beads collect upon the walls of this narrow pas­
sage, and the flooring is cold and damp. A low ceiling, 
only five feet tall, further cramps this dank place. 
The northern entrance to this passage is a block of stone 
mounted on a central pivot, which has been wedged par­
tially open by accumulated debris. 
The location of the southern entrance appears to be 
a blank wall when initially viewed from within the pas­
sage. The portal can be opened from inside the passage 
by releasing a concealed catch at the intersection of the 
wall and the ceiling. Finding the catch requires a suc­
cessful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. 
11. THE COURT OF CEMANAHUAC 
(Say-man-AH-wok, place surrounded by water) 
Describe the features of this room as the characters 
become able to see them or examine them. The text as­
sumes the characters are approaching from the south. 
The doors to this room are made of bronze and are 
tinted blue from oxidation. Just inside the doorway are 
two small alcoves. Each space contains an old fountain, 
cracked and crusted with lime. Around the fountain in 
the eastern alcove, a heap of rubbish litters the floor. The 
fountain in the western alcove still holds some green 
scummy water, in which something moves. 
A short hall ending in descending steps leads to the 
central chamber, which is flooded. A dark, foul pool 
covers the entire floor. A central hall, flanked by narrow 
aisles, is defined by two rows of massive square columns. 
The walls are coated with slime, and there are glowing 
silver lines etched across them. From what you can see 

--- PAGE 72 ---

of the chamber's walls, the stone appears to e 
crudely worked. 
Two corroded bronze braziers stand in the poo. To­
ward the middle of the room, two broken urns, eac 
apparently once about four feet tall, poke up out o t e 
water. In the darkness on the eastern wall appears to be 
an enormous growth of an overall greenish hue that gives 
off the same silvery gleam as the slime trails. 
The water in the central area of the floor is 2 feet deep, 
and the floor is very slippery-moving across this dif­
ficult terrain costs 3 feet of speed for every 1 foot trav­
eled). Any sudden actions, including those necessary 
for combat, might result in the character taking a spill. 
A character who takes the Dash action or tries to fight 
while in the room must first succeed on a DC 10 Dexter­
ity saving throw or fall prone. 
Moat. The 10-foot-wide section of floor that runs along 
the east, west, and north sides of the room is 10 feet 
ower than in the rest of the room, creating a 12-foot­
deep moat. Characters who don't probe ahead will be 
unable to detect the drop-off until it is too late. 
Lime. The walls are heavily coated with lime, which 
also pollutes the water. If a character stands in this wa­
·er for more than 30 minutes, the soaked portions of the 
character's clothing begin to rot away. 
Creature. The phosphorescent glow on the eastern 
·vall is actually a giant slug named Tecuziztecatl (see 
appendix B), the Lord of Snails. Tecuziztecatl (Tay­
COO-zeez-tay-COT-el) is highly intelligent and quite the 
.>0aster. In ancient lore it was considered to be related to 
;:he moon, a fact of which it is quite proud. During com­
::>at the slug will detail, in Olman, what it has in store for 
;:he characters and how hopeless their situation is. 
If it begins to lose the combat, the slug will either 
• urrender" and after bargaining agree to help the party, 
or else it will flee and conceal itself in the moat. If the 
characters allow themselves to be helped, the slug will 
precede them to the north side of the moat and stretch 
·t body across the gap, making it appear to be solid 
ground. Those who step on the slug without taking pre­
-autions will plunge into the moat. 
The slug will lead the party toward the Tomb of Hura­
.--.an (area 12) and instruct them to open the door. Once 
;:he door is open, Tecuziztecatl will flee from the party 
and hide in the bottom of the moat. 
Eastern Alcove. The eastern fountain has a small 
amount of concentrated lime solution near the bottom 
dealing damage as the lime in area 5). It looks like 
doudy water. A small amulet lies beneath the caked 
jme. The amulet (worth 65 gp) is made of brass and 
-hrysoprase, engraved with the words "Lord of Snails." 
: is possible to use the amulet as a bargaining tool with 
· e giant slug, which will accept it in return for allowing 
;:he characters passage to the Tomb of Hurakan . 
In the southeast corner of the eastern alcove, a swarm 
of rats nests in the rubbish. The swarm is made up of 
diseased giant rats. Western Alcove. The western fountain is filled with 
algae, and some bullfrogs are raising a brood of tad­
poles in the water. 
12. THE TOMB OF HURAKAN 
(Ewe-RA-kan, god of the flood) 
If the characters approach from the north (through the 
corridor marked 12A), read: 
This passageway is slime-covered, and a stream of water 
trickles away from the door. There is condensation on the 
walls, door, and ceiling, some of which drips down on 
you. A quiet sound of dripping and splashing echoes in 
the corridor. This door is tightly sealed and appears to be 
warped outward or wedged shut. The door's hinges are 
mounted on this side. 
The door requires a successful DC 20 Strength (Ath­
letics) check to pull it open. The difficulty is due to the 
fact that the room behind the door is entirely filled with 
water, which has bowed the door and jammed it shut. 
Those who listen at the door will hear a slight splashing 
and gurgling, if they hear anything at all. 
Opening the door will release a wave of water. Those 
hit by the water take 2 (ld4) bludgeoning damage and 
must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be 
knocked down and washed along the passage to the 
north, then westward. A creature that succeeds on a 
DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check while moving around 
a corner can grab onto the stonework there and halt its 
movement. When the flood washes to area 11, the water 
bursts open the doors there (if they weren't open al­
ready), and anyone in the water is dumped into the moat. 
A character who is washed down the hall must suc­
ceed on DC 15 Dexterity saving throw to keep a hold on 
anything in hand. Heavy objects sink to the floor in the 
hall, but lighter ones are washed into the moat. 
12B. TOMB, SOUTH ENTRANCE 
If the characters traverse the corridor from east to west, 
describe the area as they advance. 
This hall is strewn with mud and flotsam. Water accumu­
lates in the center of the corridor and flows westward to 
where a stone block in the southern wall has shifted out 
of place. The corridor turns north, and the flow of water 
follows it, then goes under a door made of bronze-bound 
wood. The door has a handle and a keyhole. 
Opening the door will reveal stairs going down into a 
small room. A pool of water fills the entire chamber. An­
other door is across the way, but only the top 3 inches of 
it can be seen above the water. 
CHAPTER 3 I THE HIDDEN SHRINE OF TAMOACHAN 

--- PAGE 73 ---

7'2. 13. CHILD OF ZOTZILAHA 
A faint, melodious sound comes from ahead. It is diffi­
cult to tell whether it is someone singing or the echoing 
of dripping water in a great cavern. 
If the characters burst into the room, they immediately 
hear a surprised squeal and a splash. 
The room is lit by a soft light that reveals a section of 
rocky beach. Beyond the beach is a pool of glowing wa­
ter, filling half the room and framed by a crystal cavern. 
Green fronds can be seen in the pool. Light seems to 
flow from everywhere, the pool and walls glistening like 
soft moonlight . On the far side of the pool is a set of 
doors carved with a sun symbol. 
If the characters approached quietly, they might glimpse 
the singer. 
Sitting on the beach in front of the crystalline pool is 
a woman, young and slim, with long golden hair and 
pale white skin. She radiates a soft silvery light even 
through her shawl, white as the froth of waves. She is 
singing a strange melody in an unrecognizable language. 
After finishing her song, she enters the water in a long, 
arching dive. 
Water covers more than half of the cavern. The floor 
drops off sharply, creating a pool that is 12 feet deep. A 
ledge runs from the southern wall to a set of doors that 
lead east. Above the ledge, the water is only 2 feet deep, 
but the area counts as difficult terrain. 
The doors that lead east have keyholes in them but 
are unlocked. 
Creatures. The young woman is actually a nereid 
(see appendix B) named Dasa Zotz. Whether startled or 
not, eventually the nereid surfaces and a silvery laugh 
is heard. This creature is an agent of Zotzilaha. Unlike 
most other nereids, she is chaotic evil in alignment, and 
she speaks Olman instead of Common. She possesses 
an insidious and clever mind, concealed beneath her 
alien beauty and seeming naivete. She retreats from 
close combat and conceals herself in the water. 
The nereid has a pet named Chae, a giant lightning 
eel (see appendix B). If she calls to Chae for aid, she 
does so on her turn when she uses Water Lash. The 
waters begin to heave and boil, and the watery form of a 
human with an elephantine head, wearing an elaborate 
headdress and holding a trident, rises up. The eel comes 
near the surface and strikes when the watery "god" lev­
els its trident at a character. 
Treasure. If seriously threatened, the nereid might 
reveal the location of her treasure. At the deepest part of 
the pool is a grotto hidden behind a bed of kelp. In this 
CHAPTER 3 I THE HIDDEN SHRINE OF TAMOACHAN ca\·e are six golden statuettes (worth 50 gp each) and a 
golden ma k worth ro gp). Also lying in the cache are 
two cryscal croll ca es (worth 25 gp apiece), though 
water has de rroyed rhe scrolls in them; a silver idol 
(worth 15 gp). which is actually a bottle holding a potion 
of clairvoyance ; and a pair of gloves of missile snaring. 
14. FLOODED HALL 
Half of the L-shaped corridor is flooded. The water is 
3 feet deep and cold, and the bottom is very slippery; 
moving across this difficult terrain costs 3 feet of speed 
for every 1 foot traveled. Any sudden actions, including 
those necessary for combat, might result in the charac­
ter taking a spill. A character who takes the Dash action 
or tries to fight within the room must first succeed on a 
DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. 
The water becomes shallower to the east. After the 
corridor turns north, a set of stairs rises up out of the 
dampness, and the path ends at a set of bronze doors. 
The doors have keyholes but are unlocked. 
15. THE GREAT HALL 
This hallway is twenty feet wide and has piles of rubble 
and debris scattered along its length. The walls are cov­
ered with frescoes. The south wall displays scenes of a 
battle between natives and invaders. 
The north wall depicts people questing for a new land; 
their experiences during the journey include crossing 
treacherous mountains, sailing over storm-tossed seas, 
and receiving the guidance of the gods in their battles to 
keep their homeland free from invasions . In the center of 
the wall is a painting of a pyramid with a temple atop it 
and the sun shining over the land. 
Double bronze doors stand in the eastern end of 
the south wall. Down the hall to the west is an archway 
carved in the form of twining serpents. Beyond it, the 
corridor continues on into shadow. 
The hallway extends only 5 feet beyond the arch. The 
western wall is a cleverly painted mural designed to give 
the illusion of depth and reality, and the obscuring effect 
of the poison gas contributes to this impression. If char­
acters attempt to go in this direction, they walk straight 
into the wall unless someone succeeds on a DC 15 Wis­
dom (Perception) check. The space beyond the arch im­
mediately in front of the mural is where creatures arrive 
after being teleported from the south end of area 32. 
To either side of the arch is a 5-foot-deep niche. A 
character who steps into either niche triggers a pres­
sure plate (see "The Ruins: General Features" at the 
beginning of the adventure) that releases a set of hori­
zontal bars-closing off the archway and trapping the 
interloper. 
The character can instead take 10 minutes to remove 
the plate from the floor, requiring the same sort of check 
as for an attempt to block the plate from moving. A failed 
check in this case means another 10 minutes of work is 
required , followed by another check. 

--- PAGE 74 ---

Sun Painting. The painting of the pyramid an •· e 
un conceals a secret door. A character whom ·e a 
-uccessful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception chec · di cm·­
ers that the portion of the work that depict the sun is 
·eparate from the rest and can be depres ed. Pu hing it 
nward reveals and opens a secret door in the wall. The 
tloor of the passage that leads north is 8 feet above the 
:1oor of the great hall. Accessing this secret exit cau es 
any bars over the niches to retract into the wall and the 
pressure plates to reset. 
16. SECRET DOOR 
This description assumes an approach from the north. 
The south side of the secret door is described in area 15. 
The wall at the end of this corridor has a bas relief sculp­
ture of a warrior armed with a spear and shield. The 
shield, which rests on the floor, resembles a sundial, 
complete with a marker standing out from the wall. 
Etched on the shield's surface are runes in Olman script. 
The message on the shield reads, "Turn back!" 
Instead of being part of a solid carving, the shield has 
a seam that a character can discover with a successful 
DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. Chips around the 
·earn suggest that the shield can be pivoted. Experi­
mentation thereafter reveals that the sundial marker is 
movable. When it's in its current position, leaning to the 
,ight, the secret door is closed. If the marker is pushed 
o the left, the shield pivots, and the exit opens. 
The floor of the area beyond the door is 8 feet lower 
·han the floor in the corridor. 
1-. HALL OF THE GREAT SPIRITS 
This corridor is high-ceilinged and decorated with sculp­
tures mounted on the walls. Two corridors branch off 
from the main hall, a narrow one to the east and another 
to the west. The statuary that adorns the walls consists 
of four sculpted heads of animals. Each one is six feet 
above the floor and two to three feet in diameter. Oppo­
site the passage that leads east is the stylized head of 
a coyote, and across from the hallway going west is the 
head of a grinning bear. Near the south end of the corri­
dor, the head of a bison is mounted on the east wall. 
At the north end of the area, on the west wall, is what 
appears to be the head of an eagle, with its beak open. 
Something shines from within the eagle's mouth. 
Wedged in the eagle's throat is an intricately crafted 
golden bracelet. To remove the item, a character must ei­
her reach into the mouth or attempt to push the bracelet 
out with another object. 
Snapping Trap. Disturbing the bracelet in any way 
will cause the beak to snap shut instantly. Whatever was 
inserted into the mouth will be pinned, and the hinge of 
the mechanism will jam. The hinge can be loosened with oil, after which the 
beak opens easily, or the beak (AC 16, 25 hit points) can 
be broken off by dealing bludgeoning damage to it that 
reduces it to O hit points. If a character's arm is caught 
in the beak when the beak is struck, that character takes 
one-quarter of the damage dealt to the beak and the 
beak takes the remainder. 
Treasure. The golden circlet is a bracelet of rock 
magic (see appendix A) that was originally a ring, an 
earring, or some other piece of stone giant jewelry. 
18. HALLWAY OF THE ANCESTORS 
Along both sides of the corridor, deep in shadows, hu­
man figures appear to be floating above the floor. As you 
approach, you see that the figures seemingly suspended 
in the air are actually withered corpses standing upright 
on a ledge two feet above the floor. 
Creatures. Once the lead character in the party 
reaches the midway point of the east-west passage, fif­
teen zombies animate and attack. These corpses don't 
register as undead to a casting of detect evil and good 
until after they animate. 
Disease. After combat with the zombies is finished, 
each character who took damage from the monsters 
must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or 
contract sewer plague (see "Sample Diseases" in chap­
ter 8 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). Unlike the normal 
disease, symptoms of this disease manifest in an in­
fected creature after 1 hour rather than ld4 days. 
CHAPTER 3 I THE HIDDEN SHRINE OF TAMOACHAN 73 

--- PAGE 75 ---

74 19. SILVER COFFER 
At the end of the corridor is a small alcove holding a 
three-foot-tall stone pedestal on which rests a small 
silver coffer. Fifteen feet in front of the alcove, there is a 
single small step up in the stone floor. Inside the alcove, 
the floor is elevated an additional two feet. 
Hinged Floor. A character who examines the base of 
the 2-foot step along the edge of the raised floor and suc­
ceeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check notices 
a metallic glint coming from a hinge that runs across 
the full width of the floor. The hinge can be dismantled 
by someone who uses thieves' tools, takes 5 minutes to 
do so, and succeeds on a DC 15 Dexterity check. On a 
successful check, the trap (see below) is prevented from 
triggering. On a failed check, the character hasn't man­
aged to dismantle the hinge but can try again. 
Shifting Slab Trap. If the hinge in the floor isn't dis­
mantled, a trap is triggered if more weight is placed on 
the floor of the alcove than on the space immediately 
in front of the step up. The floor inside the alcove sinks 
10 feet. At the same time, the 15-foot slab of floor north 
of the alcove (as shown on the map) rises up, pivoting 
along its south edge. The northern side of the slab now 
seals off the passage to the north, while the southern 
side slopes down toward the alcove. Those who were on 
the slab when it pivoted fall prone and roll to the bottom 
of the slope on the alcove floor, 13 feet below where the 
coffer sits on its pedestal. Each creature that falls in this 
way takes 3 (ld6) bludgeoning damage. 
When the slab finishes moving, it locks into place, so 
the floor remains steeply sloped and the passage north 
remains blocked. The locking mechanism is hidden by 
the northern (elevated) edge of the floor, and it's in a very 
narrow space. The stone around it can be chipped away 
over several hours of tedious labor until the edge of the 
slab no longer holds in place. A knock spell can also de­
feat the locking mechanism. 
Treasure. The silver coffer is unlocked, but it is 
latched, so the lid will not come open unless the charac­
ters touch the box. 
Inside the coffer is a strange copper figurine, narrow, 
with fins, looking somewhat fish-like. Written on the side 
of this figurine are strange runes. On the slimmer end is 
a small arched square panel. 
The runes are in a script similar to Elvish and spell out 
the name Ilnedraw. Deft fingers will be able to open the 
small panel, revealing a hollow inside which is a wall of 
lighted, colored beads. 
Touching any of the beads will cause the panel to 
close. A few seconds thereafter , the figurine will rise 
into the air and start to fly about the alcove, hovering 
at times and avoiding being touched by characters or 
missiles. Once an exit is available, the figure will fly 
from the party and move randomly through the ruins, 
CHAPTER 3 I THE HIDDEN SHRINE OF TAMOACHAN stopping at doors and pausing for a minute. This float­
ing statuette serves no purpose and is more or less a 
false lead. 
The silver coffer weighs 15 pounds and is worth 150 
gp due to its fine workmanship. The copper figure is 
worth 50 gp and weighs 5 pounds. 
20. SPIRIT GUARD OF AYOCUAN 
(A-YO-kwan) 
A massive bronze door opens into this grand chamber. 
The place is filled with rubble and life-sized statuary, 
much of it broken. Standing in ranks is an army of clay 
statues, in what must have once been an impressive ar­
ray. Now, half of them are fallen and crumbled. Near the 
door are spear-wielders, perhaps twenty of them, outfit­
ted only in scraps of leather now. At their feet lay obsid­
ian spearheads and bits of rotted \.AJooden shafts. Behind 
these figures are archers, in a scattered formation. Few 
of them remain standing. Their arrows are gone, but they 
hold laminated bows, dried and worm-eaten. 
Farther into the room are figures of warriors with war 
clubs and handaxes, wearing scraps of lacquered leather, 
sandals, and caps. Beyond all of this in the north end of 
the chamber are a group of statues that must have been 
an honor guard. These warriors wear feathered robes and 
headdresses and are armed with pitted bronze spears. 
Each of these figures wears a breastplate of shells. They 
are standing near a domed structure . The stuccoed 
dome has no apparent openings. 
On the east wall of the room are two carved stone col­
umns flanking the remains of a covered sedan or litter, 
with statues of attendants standing nearby. 
Treasure. The stuccoed dome is a cairn. It is a weak 
construction and can be broken into in 1 minute, using 
any bludgeoning instruments. If the characters work in 
concert, the time can be divided among multiple work­
ers. Inside are six sets of worthless bones and six jade 
bead pectorals , worth 50 gp each. In a dusty corner is a 
pendant made of silver and turquoise, which is an am­
ulet of protection from turning (see appendix A). In the 
center of the floor of this cairn is a bronze and chryso­
prase lamp set into the stucco, worth 15 gp. 
Creature. Lifting the lamp will open a hidden door 
in the floor, releasing a wight called Ayocuan from the 
compartment in which he has been trapped. Ayocuan 
wears another amulet of protection from turning. 
Covered Sedan. Inside the curtained portion of the 
litter are the skeletal remains of a human, his arms are 
shackled to an arm of the sedan. In his rib cage can be 
found three arrowheads. Mixed throughout the broken 
clay in the immediate area are nearly five thousand 
beads of coral and shell worth 1 cp each. 
20A. Behind the columns along the east wall is a 
bronze door barred shut with a pitted copper bar so that 

--- PAGE 76 ---

it can't be opened from the outside. From m de 
room, one has merely to remove the bar. 
21. STONE BLOCK 
• 
A large block of stone obstructs the corridor a eac. • 
doesn't seem to have been a part of the or;ginal co . 
struction, for its composition is more sandy than the 
stones that make up the walls of these ruins. Further­
more, a gap of several inches is visible along the sides of 
the block and between the stone and the ceiling. 
This block was placed by the ancient architects to 
prevent access into the lower chambers and deter 
grave-robbers. 
To reach its current position, the stone was slid south­
;•,ard down the gently sloping passage to the north. 
That passage has several rollers built into the floor 
o aid in moving the stone across it. The block can be 
pushed back up the rollers by the combined effort of up 
o four characters with a total Strength of 45 or higher, 
or moved out onto the bare stone floor by the combined 
effort of up to four characters with a total Strength of 50 
or higher. In either case, the stone can be moved a num­
ber of feet per round equal to half the walking speed of 
the slowest individual among the workers. 
If the block is pushed up the rollers, it will roll back 
next round to block the corridor if not braked with a 
·arge object. 
22. CHAMBER OF THE NACEHUAL 
• 'ah-SAY-wal , the achieved ones) 
All the doors bordering this lozenge-shaped room are 
made of heavy bronze. Colorful glyphs are scribed on the 
western wall. There are two sideboards against the walls 
to the east. 
In the middle of the chamber are two stone divans, 
each with a human figure stretched out on it. Between 
:he divans is a low stone table holding a flask and two 
goblets, all made of crystal. In the bottom of the crystal 
flask is a quantity of silvery dust. 
The figures on the divans are a male and female, each 
about middle-aged and perfectly preserved. They are very 
still, dust-covered, and apparently dead. Their bodies are 
covered with dry snakeskin. The female wears a silver 
oracelet and holds what looks to be an ivory wand. The 
male has an amulet of electrum resting on his chest, in­
set with a red stone of considerable size. 
he glyphs, in Olman, read, "Beware ... many-eyed god 
.-ill bring down a fiery death." 
Poison Dust. Mixing the silvery powder in the flask 
;th any liquid will create a special potion. A creature that drinks it must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution sav­
ing throw or become poisoned for 5,000 years. While 
poisoned in this way, a creature is also unconscious but 
semi-aware of its surroundings, and it is unaffected by 
the passage of time or other poisons. If magic is used to 
cure the poisoned condition, the recipient becomes im­
mune to the poison's effect for 1 hour. A casting of dispel 
magic using a spell slot of 7th level or higher can also 
end the effect. 
Creatures. The two bodies are martial arts adepts 
(see appendix B) in suspended animation. The male is 
named Cipactonal (See-PAK-ton-al), and the female is 
Oxomoco (Oks-OH-mo-koh). They used the potion that 
the flask once contained to feign their death. If either is 
disturbed , they both instantly awaken and stand. Oxo­
moco says, first in Olman and then in an ancient dialect 
of Common, "You have broken our glorious sleep; for 
this you must atone." 
The two then assume fighting stances, and if either 
is threatened or harmed, they attack. If the party ne­
gotiates, the two demand payment of 500 gp or one 
uncommon or rare magic item. If they aren't paid, the 
monks attack. 
If the monks are questioned about the ruins, they 
know nothing to tell, except that they can translate 
the message on the western wall. They will not leave 
their chambers. 
Treasure. The ivory "wand" that Oxomoco holds is 
actually a folded fan worth 50 gp, and her platinum 
bracelet is worth 250 gp. Cipactonal's amulet, made of 
electrum and garnet, is worth 100 gp.

23. LIGHT AHEAD 
As you peer down the corridor, a faint flickering light 
becomes visible. The light begins to move through the 
hallway away from you, sputtering and wavering just at 
the edge of your perception. 
The bobbing light is a will-o'-wisp. It will attempt to lure 
the party into a trap, then use Consume Life on a victim. 
The creature will lead parties coming from the west 
toward and then into the north-south corridor. Charac­
ters approaching from the north, who might already be 
familiar with the will-o'-wisp (see area 24), will be led on 
a zigzag route through the passages toward area 19. 
23A. TRIANGULAR STONE 
If the characters approach from the south, read: 
You come upon a ten-foot-wide pit that stretches across 
the corridor. Beyond it is a wedge-shaped stone block or 
pillar that blocks the passage. The light ahead of you that 
you had been following is nowhere to be seen, as though 
it somehow passed through the pillar. 
The pit is 10 feet deep and contains several humanoid 
skeletons. 
The triangular pillar's apex points toward the pit. 
Scratches on the floor and ceiling, scribing short arcs 
on either side of it, are easy to see. Someone who exam­
ines the pillar notices that it can be pivoted to either the 
left or the right, which will open a passage 2 feet wide 
that offers access to the north. If the characters move 
through this opening, they once again see the light of 
the will-o'-wisp in the distance. 
If the characters approach from the north, read: I The hallway abruptly ends at a blank stone wall. I 
If the wall is hammered on, it will sound solid. A charac­
ter who examines the floor or the ceiling finds scratches 
that scribe an arc from one corner to the other. Pushing 
on one side of the apparent dead end causes the triangu­
lar pillar to pivot as noted above. If the characters move 
through the opening, they discover the pit. If they pro­
ceed to the south, continue with area 23. 
24. SANDBOX 
The two thick lines on the map mark the boundaries 
of a trap. A character who examines the ceiling 20 feet 
overhead as the party passes under one of the marked 
areas and makes a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Percep­
tion) check notices a narrow band of copper extending 
from wall to wall. A gap between the copper and the 
surrounding stone suggests that the metal might be part 
CHAPTER 3 I THE HIDDEN SHRINE OF TAMOACHAN of a door or a porcculli . This object can be prevented 
from coming down by wedging it in place as if it were a 
pressure plate. 
Pressure Plate. The 10-foot-square section of floor 
marked on the map is the location of a pressure plate 
(see "The Ruins: General Features" at the beginning of 
the adventure . If an amount of weight equivalent to that 
of three or four humanoids is placed on it, the trap de­
scribed below is triggered. 
Falling Door Trap. If the characters set off the trap 
by activating the pressure plate in the floor, they hear 
a click and then a crash as both portcullises, made of 
timber bound in copper, come crashing down, sealing 
off the indicated area. These barriers are a foot thick; 
each has an AC of 15 and 100 hit points. Lifting a door 
requires a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check, 
and any such check is made with disadvantage, since 
getting a good grip is difficult. If a door can first be pried 
up slightly with a crowbar or similar lever, requiring a 
successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check, someone 
not using the lever can get a grip on the bottom of the 
door, eliminating the disadvantage. 
After 5 rounds, characters confined by the trap hear 
the sound of stone slowly grating on stone. Small panels 
near the ceiling move to expose four holes the size of a 
human fist on each wall. Dust trickles from the holes. 
After another 5 rounds passes, golden sand starts to 
pour rapidly through the holes. The floor is swiftly cov­
ered by the sand, which builds up at a rate of 2 feet per 
minute. Therefore, it takes 10 minutes for the sand to 
completely fill the hallway. 
The area becomes difficult terrain after 1 minute. 
After 3 minutes of accumulation, a creature that moves 
through the sand must make a DC 10 Strength or Dex­
terity saving throw, becoming restrained on a failed 
save. (A creature that crawls need not make the saving 
throw, and creatures that have more than two legs have 
advantage on the saving throw.) 
A creature can end the restrained condition on itself 
by using an action and succeeding on a DC 10 Strength 
or Dexterity check. Another creature can use an ac­
tion to make the check and pull a restrained creature 
free. After 5 minutes of accumulation, the DC of the 
saving throw increases to 15. Once the sand is flowing, 
it must be scooped away from a closed door for some­
one to try to lift that door, and the sand flows through 
open doorways. 
The dust that fills the air as the sand falls causes 
choking. Unless it need not breathe, a creature in the 
dust must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw 
at the start of its turn. On a failed save, the creature 
spends its turn coughing, able only to move at half speed 
or to make a check (with disadvantage) to free itself from 
the restrained condition. 
Creature. As soon as the sand begins flowing, the 
will-o'wisp that frequents this part of the ruins (see 
area 23), if it remains alive, moves through one of the 
doors into the trapped area. It harries those who are 
having the most success at escaping the trap.

25. THE NEST OF THE WARRIORS 
• 
A bitter stench assails the senses as you lay e)es or. ::ie 
room ahead. Inside, amid a pile of rubbish, offa, ar.c 
bracken, ghostly lights move across the floor. 
Closer observation reveals that the light is emitted t>y 
giant beetles. There seem to be around a dozen of these 
creatures in the room, each about three feet in length. 
They don't appear to take notice of you. From within the 
largest pile of trash, where most of the beetles are clus­
tered, come glints of something shiny. 
Creatures. The garbage-infested room is home to thir­
reen giant fire beetles. They lack the two light-emitting 
glands behind the eyes that are normal for such crea­
rures. They do give off a soft glow that emanates from 
their abdomens but doesn't provide significant illumina­
ion. The beetles are nonaggressive unless their nest is 
threatened. Any sudden noise will bring a beetle or two 
o investigate . They examine any strange object with 
dieir feelers, and if it is edible, they bite it. Other beetles 
move toward the sound of their comrades fighting. 
Treasure. The shiny objects in the beetles' nest are 
odd pieces of metal, polished rocks, broken crystal, 
three large turquoises (worth 20 gp each), and a +l dag­
ger that looks like junk. When it is used, its grip frays, 
1t blade chips, and it flakes rust. If a character wielding 
this weapon gets a natural 1 on an attack roll, the dag­
ger breaks and becomes nonmagical. 
LOCATIONS ON THE FIRST TIER 
.-\scending either of the routes out of the lower cham­
bers brings the characters to the first tier of the 
emple proper. The following locations are identified 
on map 3.1. 
26. RAMP 
If the characters approach from the north, read: 
• 
A ramp slopes gently down from north to south. Set in 
the floor at two-foot intervals are smooth stone cylinders 
that apparently function as rollers. 
If the characters approach from the south, read: 
A ramp leads gently up from south to north. Set in the 
floor at two-foot intervals are smooth stone cylinders 
that apparently function as rollers. 
27. STAIRS 
This corridor ascends from south to north in a series of 
short, gently sloped staircases. 
Pressure Plate. The 10-foot square indicated on the 
map is the location of a pressure plate (see .. The Ruins: General Features" at the beginning of the adventure) . 
If more than 30 pounds is placed on the plate, the trap 
described below triggers. 
If the characters detect the presence of this plate, they 
can remove it from the floor with 10 minutes of work 
and a successful check as for an attempt to block the 
plate from moving. A failed check means another 10 
minutes of work is required , followed by another check. 
Rolling Stone Trap. A millstone , concealed in the 
wall behind a layer of stucco, lies at the top of the steps. 
No nonmagical means can detect the hidden stone. If 
the trap is triggered, the mechanism pushes the mill­
stone through the wall and sends it rolling down the 
stairs. When this occurs, anyone who has a passive Per­
ception score of 14 or lower is surprised. Everyone rolls 
initiative, including the stone, which has a +10 bonus 
to the roll. On its turn, the stone moves 60 feet. Anyone 
in its path must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving 
throw or take 27 (5d10) bludgeoning damage and have 
a 50 percent chance to drop anything carried in hand. A 
character whose saving throw fails by 5 or more takes 
maximum damage, is knocked prone, and drops any­
thing held in hand. Dropped objects take damage from 
hitting the stone and end up somewhere on the stairs. 
The stone ultimately crashes into the doors to area 
25, breaking them open and destroying them. If beetles 
remain in the room, some or all of them come into the 
stairway agitated and looking for a fight. 
28. THE ARC OF NANAHUATCIN 
(Na-na-WA-tzen, the Pimply One) 
This is a spacious, vaulted hall, weathered and cracked 
from the ravages of time. The walls are charred and 
scored. Scattered around the floor are several stone 
statues of baboon-like creatures, chipped and tipped 
over. The remains of a few once-living baboons , partially 
eaten, lie nearby, with fungus covering their corpses. 
As the area is further penetrated, it is discerned that 
this was once a processional hall. Little remains to iden­
tify its past purpose except for a carving etched in the 
center of the worn floor that depicts a silver sun with a 
single eye. The beast that lairs here will not attack until 
the party sights it. 
Ahead, something spherical floats in the air at about 
chest height. The sphere has a central eye and about a 
dozen tentacles growing out of its top. Each appendage 
has a white sphere with a black pupil at its tip. 
Creature. The spherical creature is a gas spore that 
represents Nanahuatcin , the "sun." 
Treasure. Near the center of the south wall is a sack 
made of fish skin. It contains seven silver pellets, each 
about the size of a sling bullet and worth 1 gp. 
CHAPTER 3 I THE HIDDEN SHRINE OF TAMOACHAN 77 

--- PAGE 79 ---

29. THE TOMB OF PELOTA 
As you approach a bend in the passage, you see a series 
of faint line drawings on the walls depicting people play­
ing a game that uses a ball and has goals on either end of 
the playing field. 
At the place where the corridor bends is a capstone that 
seemingly covers a hole in the floor. Etched into the 
top of the slab are several glyphs obscured by a layer 
of dust. This writing, in Olman, reads, "Dare not open 
this pit unless you be willing to meet the challenge 
of pelota." 
Five feet above the capstone in the southern wall is a 
hemispherical depression 1 foot in diameter. 
Lifting the capstone requires the application of lever­
age and the combined effort of up to two characters with 
a total Strength of 25 or higher. Beneath the stone lid 
is a pit filled with the skeletal remains of the losers of a 
previous game of pelota in this area. Atop the bones rest 
several figurines and a plaque, all made of jade, and a 
glistening black ball 1 foot in diameter. 
Cursed Treasure. If any treasure is removed from 
the pit, a curse will fall upon its bearer 1 hour later. The 
victim must succeed on a DC 15 saving throw, or it has 
disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity ability checks 
and saving throws until the curse is dispelled. 
The jade plaque depicts two men, wearing padding on 
their arms and hips, with a large ball traveling between 
them. The figurines are carved in the image of a sun-god 
in a feathered robe. There are seven jade items in all, 
weighing 1 pound and worth 30 gp each. 
CHAPTER 3 I THE HIDDEN SHRINE OF TAMOACHAN Buried beneath he ·eletons is a chalice of beaten 
gold. inset with L-.;: amethysts, that weighs 1 pound and 
is worth 150 gp. 
Pelota Ball. The ball. made of rubber wound around 
a balsa core. is u ed in the game of pelota. It is the same 
size as the depression in the wall, which is one of the 
goals on this playing field. The ball is cool to the touch. 
If it is picked up. it suddenly jerks free of the holder's 
grasp and rebounds off the south wall, then speeds 30 
feet to the north and hovers. It animates for the purpose 
of challenging the violators of the tomb to a game. 
The ball can fly up to 30 feet on its turn, and it can 
hover. It makes melee weapon attacks with a +5 bonus, 
dealing 1 (ld4 -1) bludgeoning damage on a hit. The 
ball has AC 13 and 50 hit points. It is immune to all 
damage except for magical effects that deal acid, fire, 
force, piercing, or slashing damage. The ball is immune 
to most conditions , but it can be grappled or restrained 
by effects that work on objects. It makes ability checks 
to escape such entanglements with a +5 bonus. 
Start of the Game. Roll initiative. The ball uses its 
initial actions to bounce off the walls and strike at char­
acters, trying to get them to strike back. When a char­
acter's attack hits the ball, it bounces off the south wall, 
and the depression in the wall briefly glows orange. 
After the second such occurrence, the ball will break 
off its attacks. A sound like that of a trumpet indicates 
that the game is about to start. The goal above the pit 
and another goal at the northern end of the hall 140 feet 
away are limned in orange light that remains until the 
game ends. When the characters hit the ball, it flies to 
the south and the southern goal flashes briefly. When 
the ball moves, it flies to the north, and the northern 
goal flashes. 
How to Win. The characters win the game by propel­
ling the ball into the goal above the pit while preventing 
the ball from reaching the northern end of the hall. If all 
the characters fail to hit the ball for 1 round, the faint 
sound of a drum dirge will be heard. 
A character who attacks the ball successfully sends 
it flying south up to 15 feet. To knock the ball into the 
southern goal, the ball must be within 15 feet of the 
goal, and a player must declare that the character is 
trying to score. If the character's attack roll exceeds the 
ball's AC by 4 or more, the ball goes into the goal. 
If the ball moves to within 5 feet of the northern wall, 
it can bounce itself into its own goal. To do so, the ball 
must make a successful attack roll against AC 15. 
Once the ball is knocked into a goal, it sticks there for 
1 round, impossible to remove without destroying it. If 
the ball enters the goal to the north, a number of magic 
missiles erupt from the goal equal to the number of con­
scious characters in the corridor. Each missile strikes a 
different character for 3 (ld4 + 1) force damage. 
When the ball moves out of a goal, it flies to the center 
of the corridor and hovers, awaiting the start of another 
point. The game continues until the characters die or 
score a goal that puts them 2 points ahead of the ball. 
Spoils of Victory. If the characters win, the ball be­
comes inert. The sound of triumphant drums erupts 
briefly, then the area goes silent. The southern goal goes 
dark, but the northern goal continues to glow orange. 

--- PAGE 80 ---

Investigation reveals that a small panel has opened in 
me back of the depression. Within the space beyond 
is a pouch made of fish skin that holds ten pink pearls 
worth 20 gp each), a topaz and shell necklace (worth 50 
gp), and a whistle made of an eagle's bone with feather 
decoration, which is an eagle whistle (see appendix A). 
30. THE GUARDIAN BEAST 
This oddly shaped room is decorated in a cat motif. The 
center of the southeastern wall is carved to resemble 
the face of a snarling tiger with hollow eyes. Near the 
center of the room is a stuffed tiger, posed as if on the 
prowl. The tiger's left ear has been torn off, leaving a 
agged scar on the head. Also near the middle of the 
room stands a stone statue of a tiger-headed man hold­
ng a spear. 
In several other spots on the floor are stuffed domestic 
cats in various poses: sitting, stalking, pouncing, and one 
s begging, pawing the air. One of these cats in the center 
of the room has been knocked over and chewed on; its 
stuffing is falling out. 
Hung on the walls are several skins of lions and leop­
ards, tiger heads, and a cat-of-nine- tails. Along the 
northwest edge of the chamber a large calendar stone is 
mounted on the wall above a stone table or altar. 
The statue of the cat-man depicts a tall human male 
.11ith two extra sets of nipples. He seems to be wearing 
a tiger-faced mask and is clad only in a loincloth. A jag­
ged scar runs across the left side of his chest, above the 
heart, and his chest is sunken and bony. The spear is 
stone-hafted, but bears a silvery head. All the items hanging on the walls are actually realisti­
cally painted stucco sculptures. If the characters investi­
gate the calendar stone, see area 31. 
Creature. The statue is a petrified werejaguar (use 
the weretiger statistics). If the altar is molested or any 
of the room's contents are abused, the werejaguar be­
comes aware and seizes the first opportunity to attack 
with surprise. It can turn to flesh as a bonus action and 
then transform into cat shape, dropping its spear. (The 
magic on the creature renders it strongly related to 
earth and stone with regard to the curse on the bracelet 
of rock magic, described in appendix A.) Its first choice 
of targets is always the weakest member of the party. 
If the werejaguar is reduced to O hit points, it reverts to 
human form and becomes petrified again. 
The werejaguar's heart has been removed by magical 
surgery and is hidden in the head of the stuffed tiger 
(hinted at by the scars on man and tiger). Therefore, the 
cat-man might take damage or even die, but unless its 
heart is destroyed, it is reborn again whole in one day's 
time. If the lycanthrope's heart (AC 10, 2 hit points) is 
destroyed, the creature dies and turns to dust. 
Treasure. In the belly of the stuffed tiger are 500 gp. 
Eye of the Tiger. A secret door is concealed in the 
mouth of the wall carving. The catch to open it is hidden 
in the hollow of the right eye. The door and the catch 
each require a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) 
check to find. 
31. CALENDAR STONE 
The calendar, a great wheel of stone, is carved from lime­
stone. In the center of the calendar is a symbol of the 
sun surrounded with various sigils depicting seasons of 
the year. The stone is ten feet across and is mounted five 
feet above the floor over a stone altar. On the altar rests 
a ceremonial dagger of flint and a jade statue of a cat. At 
the foot of the altar is a stuffed cat, posed as if begging 
or attempting to catch something in the air. 
Secret Passage. The calendar stone covers a door 
and a secret passage to a hidden tomb. A character 
who examines the calendar and succeeds on a DC 15 
Wisdom (Perception) check can see that it is held onto 
the wall by a smaller rod of stone behind it. The gap 
between the calendar and the wall is a few inches wide, 
so characters looking at the calendar in a specific way 
might notice the unusual mounting without making a 
check. In order to open the door, the sun symbol must 
be pushed into the wall. The calendar stone and the wall 
behind it then swing to one side on a set of hinges. 
Treasure. The sacrificial knife on the table is a +1 
dagger. The jade statue is worth 200 gp and weighs 9 
pounds. In the tail of the stuffed cat is a scroll of protec­
tion (feline beasts and feline lycanthropes). 
CHAPTER 3 I THE HIDDEN SHRINE OF TAMOACHAN 
79 

--- PAGE 81 ---

80 32. THE PORTAL TO DEATH 
Behind the concealed entrance is a narrow tunnel that 
slants down and away. The passage is barely four feet in 
diameter, and the walls are carved with a profusion of 
ancient and weird glyphs. The floor of the tunnel is slick 
with a molten, glassy glaze. 
These nonmagical glyphs are of two types. Some are 01-
man curses cautioning and cursing trespassers; others 
are arcane symbols of abjuration, which is apparent to 
anyone who has proficiency in the Arcana skill. 
The tunnel opens out two feet above the floor of a corri­
dor running north and south. Three exits are visible, one 
at either end of the hallway and a set of double doors on 
the midpoint of the western wall. 
The door to the north is barred, though it seems to 
have no latch. The image of a bear holding a disk of ob­
sidian is set in its face. The lintel of the door is carved in 
the form of entwined serpents. 
The southern door is plated in bronze. Etched on it is 
a symbol of two circles joined. The path leading up to it 
has a depression in the stone floor, as though it has been 
worn smooth by the passage of countless feet. 
The floor in front of the central doorway is sunken and 
glazed. Affixed across the double doors is a golden seal 
one foot in diameter with ancient glyphs scribed into it. 
To open this door, it appears that the golden seal must 
be broken. Ancient glyphs are scribed on the seal. To 
either side on the lintel of the door are barely discernible 
scratches, and brown stains stipple the wall and floor. 
Northern Door. Even after the bar is removed, the 
false door will not open. It appears to open outward, but 
when a character pushes against it, three arms spring 
out from the lintel and surround the character. Spotting 
these arms among the entwined serpents in the lintel re­
quires a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. 
The arms are treated as a pressure plate (see "The 
Ruins: General Features" at the beginning of the adven­
ture) if a character attempts to jam them in place to keep 
them from moving. 
A character caught in the trap can wriggle free only 
with a successful DC 20 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. 
Otherwise, unconfined characters can attempt to free 
a victim. The combined effort of two characters with a 
total Strength of 30 or higher is needed to pry back each 
arm, taking 1 round to move each one. 
After a victim has been trapped for 5 rounds, the cover 
to a 5-foot-square pit starts to drop open. The pit is 
lined with spikes. The cover fully opens in 2 rounds, at 
which point the arms swiftly spring back into the lintel, 
CHAPTER 3 I THE HIDDEN SHRINE OF TAMOACHAN releasing any victims to plummet into the 15-foot-deep 
pie. A fall into the pit deals 11 (2d10) bludgeoning dam­
age. The spikes are hard rubber wrapped around balsa 
wood. placed for artistic effect. 
Southern Door. The image on the southern door is 
the infinity symbol, representing the dual-god, the su­
preme god of creation. The door isn't latched, but it is 
stuck shut. A detect magic spell cast on it reveals that 
an aura of conjuration magic emanates from beyond the 
door. It takes a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) 
check to bash the door open. If a creature does so, the 
door gives way suddenly, dumping the gate-crasher into 
a narrow space ahead. Any creature that enters this 
space is teleported to the west end of area 15, just out­
side the painted mural on the wall. 
Double Doors. The message on the seal, written in 
Olman, reads, "Beware! Beyond this door is death!" 
Once the seal is broken by opening the doors, it may 
not be used to reseal the doors. The gold in the seal is 
worth 250 gp. 
The door is trapped, but the only evidence of this fact 
is concealed within the door frame and under the stucco 
on the ceiling, completely hidden. When the doors are 
pushed open, five heavy crossbows, set in the ceiling of 
the room beyond, fire. Two are aimed toward each door, 
and the last is aimed down the center of the two doors. 
The crossbows have a +6 bonus to hit, and each deals 5 
(ldlO) piercing damage. 
33. THE TOMB OF TLACAELEL 
(Tlah-kah-AYL-ayl) 
Beyond the door is a pillared porch overlooking a cham­
ber that contains a model of a city. Arrayed on the porch 
are numerous clay statues of guards holding bronze­
headed spears. The face of each statue is different, as if 
they were modeled from different subjects. Next to each 
statue is a small, glazed clay pot. The walls are decorated 
with brightly colored frescoes depicting a royal court in 
ceremonial garb and a king arrayed with his armies. 
There is a chill in the chamber beyond, like that of a 
brisk winter morning. In the center of the room is an 
enormous, tarnished copper raft, crafted to resemble a 
dragon, bearing a copper coffin. The raft is afloat on a 
sea of silvery-white, flowing metal, fed by several rivers 
that trail along the floor of the room. The flowing liquid 
appears to be cool. 
Between the waterways, stepped pyramid-temples rise 
skyward in mute paean to the gods of ancient Olman. 
Three of the pyramids appear to have tops that can be 
removed. In the rest of the area, a royal complex sprawls 
across verdant fields, and courtyards and ringed market­
places dot the miniature countryside. There is a blight on 
this spectacle, however, for several of the models have 
been smashed and melted. 

--- PAGE 82 ---

Fire Trap. On the floor just inside the doo a_ 
glyph of warding (save DC 17). The first chara er o 
tep through the door and onto the glyph cau _ a 1rnll 
of fire spell to spring up in the doorway. with the dam­
aging side facing away from the character who entered. 
The wall remains in place for 1 minute. 
Creature. Within the copper coffin is a doppelganger. 
The creature emerges from the coffin through a hole in 
the side facing away from the entrance as soon a the 
glyph is triggered. It assumes the form of any character 
rapped alone in the room and tries to attack with sur-
prise. If it succeeds in slaying the character before the 
~ml/ of fire expires, then it hides the body in the coffin. 
The doppelganger is unfamiliar with the rest of the 
ruins but tries to act like the character it has killed until 
t is discovered. If the doppelganger is forced to fight 
the party, it assumes the shape of a creature of molten 
metal that shrouded in flames. The fire is an illusion and 
doesn't burn. 
Liquid Fire. The first time a creature or an object en­
·ers or touches the silvery liquid metal of the sea or the 
rivers on a turn, or a creature starts its turn in such a 
place, the creature or object takes 3 (ld6) fire damage. If 
any of this fluid is carried out of this room, it evaporates 
n 1 minute. The ships and the coffin floating on the liq­
uid deal similar fire damage if they are touched. 
Treasure Chests. Three of the pyramid-temples, 
•.-hich are fastened to the floor, conceal treasure. The 
•op of each temple is hinged like the lid of a chest, and 
·he catch is released by pressing down on the altar at 
·he top. Each of these chests holds several coin neck­
iaces, each made of three hundred sixty silver coins 
pierced and threaded on a piece of gut, and other as­
sorted valuables. 
Chest 1. The lid is jammed on the first chest that 
the characters examine, requiring a successful DC 15 
trength (Athletics) check to pry open. The chest holds 
·en coin necklaces, six pairs of jade earplugs (worth 15 
gp a set), an alabaster statuette (worth 50 gp), and an 
agate ring (worth 5 gp). 
Chest 2. The second chest is trapped. When hands are 
thrust into the treasure, a mechanical vise in the wall 
of the chest grabs the limbs within. A character must 
succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or become 
grappled by the device (escape DC 15). A creature is 
:-estrained while grappled in this way. Roll initiative. 
-ix mechanical needles spring out from the sides of 
·he chest on initiative count 0. The needles can be at­
acked (AC 12, 5 hit points). Each needle deals 1 pierc-
ing damage. 
A creature struck by one or more of the needles must 
make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. The creature 
takes 21 (6d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half 
as much damage on a successful one. In either event, 
·he creature is poisoned. The poisoned creature must 
repeat the saving throw every 24 hours, taking 3 (ld6) 
poison damage on a failure. The poison ends when the 
creature makes five successful saves against it. Until the 
poison ends, any hit points lost to it can't be regained. 
The poisoned creature is feverish and occasionally trem­
bles, gibbers, or retches. The chest holds nine coin necklaces, eight bracelets 
of beads (5 gp apiece), four small figurines of jade and 
coral (25 gp each), and three rings carved of jade and 
alabaster (10 gp each). 
Chest 3. Operating the catch of the third chest re­
quires more force than with the other two. If the catch 
is pressed, the chest lid sprays perfumed oil on anyone 
within 5 feet of it. The nozzles that produce this spray 
can be discovered by someone who succeeds on a DC 
15 Wisdom (Perception) check. The only way to disarm 
the "trap" is to disassemble the chest lid and remove it 
without pressing the catch. Doing so takes 10 minutes 
of work with thieves' tools. 
When the catch is pressed, a lever wedged in the lid 
pops up, triggering the launch of darts. The tubes that 
hold these darts are sealed with a thin layer of stucco, 
so they're all but impossible to discover without dam­
aging the chest. Someone who cautiously opens the 
chest can feel the pressure from the lever and see it by 
peeking into the chest. If someone can reach the lever 
through the half-open lid and hold it in place, the trap 
doesn't function. Holding the lever in place as the lid is 
opened requires a successful DC 12 Strength check. 
This check must be repeated in every round that the le­
ver is held down. If the trap triggers, four darts fire from 
each of the chest's front and back sides. Each dart flies 
up to 60 feet, has a +6 bonus to hit, and deals 5 (2d4) 
piercing damage on a hit. 
The third chest holds eleven coin necklaces , fifteen 
bracelets of obsidian, bronze, and shell (10 gp each), and 
two piles of gems (tourmalines, spinels, and topazes; 
sixty gems worth 5 gp each) lying upon two silver plat­
ters 15 gp apiece). 
Other Treasure. The clay pots on the porch are 
sealed with wax, and they hold scented oils and per­
fumes-there are twenty such containers, each weighing 
10 pounds and with contents worth 15 gp. 
Several places that represent royal granaries in the 
modeled city are actually stone bins that hold aromatic 
woods and spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla, quince, 
cinchona, sandalwood, and pepper). This haul is worth a 
total of 250 gp and weighs 10 pounds. 
Inside the coffin are the bones of Tlacaelel, for the 
doppelganger has eaten the flesh. Scattered around the 
interior are the ornaments once worn by the corpse. 
These items include a stone box, two jade bracelets 
(worth 20 gp apiece), and an alabaster statuette of 
Coatlicue (Koh-WA-tlee-cue), the snake woman, mother 
of the gods (worth 25 gp). The stone box (worth 75 gp) 
holds five small figurines carved of coral (25 gp each), a 
large jade thumb ring (10 gp), and eight ceramic minia­
ture flasks of perfumes and essences (10 gp apiece). 
Cradled in the crook of the elbow of the corpse's right 
arm is a baton of granite. The baton is a scroll case with 
a cleverly fashioned plug. Within the case is a piece of 
faded parchment-a spell scroll of stone shape, written 
in astrological symbols of the Olman. 
Upon the skull is a ferret-faced, feathered mask that 
functions as a hat of disguise. 
CHAPTER 3 1 THE HIDDEK SHRINE OF TAMOACHAN 81 

--- PAGE 83 ---

82 33A. SACRIFICE TO THE SUN 
When the characters can see the northern end of the 
chamber, read: 
I In an alcove framed by pillars stands a stone bench on 
which a shriveled corpse huddles. Scattered around its 
feet are various trinkets. 
This figure is the preserved body of an adolescent male, 
whose heart has been cut out. He was a guesa, a boy 
chosen at birth to be sacrificed to the sun upon his com­
ing of age. 
Treasure. The items at the corpse's feet include an 
agate carved in the shape of a heart (worth 15 gp) that is 
actually a stone of ill luck (see appendix A), a miniature 
gold llama (worth 50 gp), a ring of polished pink granite 
(worth 10 gp), and a silver plaque bearing the face of the 
sun (15 gp). 
34. GUARDIANS BAR THE WAY 
The passage leads toward a set of double bronze doors 
bearing the engraved face of the jaguar god. Both walls of 
the corridor are carved to represent two lines of warriors 
in profile, holding hatchet-headed polearms and facing 
the western doors. These figures are painted with vivid, 
lifelike colors: red, black, white, green, and yellow. 
Pressure Plate. Near the midpoint of this corridor is 
a 10-foot-square pressure plate (see "The Ruins: Gen­
eral Features" at the beginning of the adventure) that 
triggers if more than 30 pounds is placed on it. 
Shocking Blades. If the pressure plate is depressed, 
two of the carved warriors pivot out from the walls in 
front of the party, crossing their metal halberds before 
them to bar the way to the northern doors. The blades 
spark and hum when they are brought together. A crea­
ture that touches either of the blades takes 5 (2d4) light­
ning damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution 
saving throw or become paralyzed while it is in contact. 
A paralyzed creature takes the damage again at the 
start of each of its turns. 
There is barely enough room for a Medium humanoid 
to crawl under the crossed polearms and between the 
statues. Doing so without touching the blades requires a 
successful DC 10 Dexterity check. 
35. XIPE1S AUDIENCE CHAMBER 
(Zee-PAY) 
When the door comes open, a rush of warm, fetid air 
greets you. The room is lit with a sanguine glow. On the 
wall opposite the door are tacked several human skins. A 
cat-o'-nine-tails hangs beside them. 
To the west the room widens to accommodate a statue 
that towers almost to the ceiling. The statue is an 
CHAPTER 3 I THE HIDDEN SHRINE OF TAMOACHAN ogre-,ke ~ g •e, .::::ed ,n flayed skins and adorned 
a gap ng mouth wide enough to swallow 
coals, more tr.a~ :en feet in diameter. 
Around t e statue is a pile of splintered bones, skulls 
with cracked pates, and broken weapons. In front of the 
display crouches a panther, deathly still, facing away from 
the statue. 
To the east the walls are highly polished. They loosely 
enclose an intricately carved well that seems to be illumi­
nated from within. Beyond the well, mounted on the wall, 
is a blackened mirror with a richly ornamented frame. Di­
rectly above the well, in the twenty-five-foot-high ceiling, 
a five-foot-wide opening can be discerned in the red light 
of the room. 
The statue represents Xipe, "Our Lord of the Flayed 
Skins." The chamber serves as the foyer to his lair, 
which lies beyond the opening in the ceiling. 
Statue Guardian. If the characters approach the 
statue, the panther will stand and pad menacingly in 
their direction ... and then continue on past them. The 
panther has a mental block that prevents it from being 
able to see humans, which initially applies to other 
humanoids as well. It likewise ignores familiars, but it 
attacks any beast companion or other non-humanoid 
present with the party. 
If the panther is not attacked and is unable to find a 
target, it takes to pacing in front of the door. If the party 
attacks the cat, its mental block regarding other human­
oids fails, and the panther attacks any such creature it 
can see. If it can see no target, the bewildered panther 
resumes its pacing. 
Treasure. Almost all the weapons around the statue 
are useless, though the head of a +l mace attached to a 
broken haft can be found. 
Well of Light. The illumination inside the well comes 
from liquid light, a fluid that clings like oil if touched to a 
given surface and in the presence of other light eventu­
ally spreads to cover the entire surface. 
If a creature falls into the well and is pulled out, the 
liquid light clings to a small portion of its body, then 
spreads to cover an additional 5 percent of the body 
every round. Eventually the liquid covers its eyes, nose 
and mouth. If this happens, the character can't breathe 
until the liquid is removed by immersion in water. In the 
absence of a light source, the liquid light doesn't spread, 
and a darkness spell renders it inert for 1 hour. 
If anything is tossed into the well, brilliant light 
flashes upward and a bellowing voice fills the chamber. 
The voice belongs to Xipe, and he asks (in Giant) who 
has come and for what purpose. Nothing else happens, 
for Xipe can't be bothered to leave his lair to investigate. 
Ceiling Tunnel. The hole in the ceiling leads to Xipe's 
lair. If the characters try to climb the walls, they dis­
cover the walls are too slick to be ascended in this way. 
A surefire way of getting in is to tie a grappling hook to 
an arrow and shoot the arrow up through the hole. This 

--- PAGE 84 ---

method never fails to anchor the hook on orne =-· 
•or Xipe grabs the rope once it is fired through · · _ · rom 
door. If a creature then decides to climb the rope up into 
·he lair, Xipe starts to reel in the climber when i has a · 
ended halfway. 
A creature being hauled up into the tunnel can relea e 
jie rope and drop into the well, taking no immediate 
damage (other than being covered in the liquid light,. 
::ir it can swing its body outward and drop onto the 
oor, taking falling damage. Otherwise , Xipe pulls the 
limber into his lair in 1 round. 
Creature. Beyond the hole in the ceiling is a chamber 
·hat measures 30 feet in each direction. It is the lair of 
Xipe, an oni. Xipe can't cast cone of cold, but he can cast 
-feet storm and fear once per day each. When he casts 
•ear, he unleashes a great bellow that shakes the room. 
Treasure. Xipe's treasure includes a wooden cylin­
er that holds a spell scroll of detect magic. Also in his 
air are piles of rich cat furs, eight of the furs worth 
-gp each. Two leather bags beneath the furs hold 
1.000 sp each. 
Lastly, an intricately carved ivory cube about 1 foot 
:all stands on an ornamental table. The cube (worth 100 
_,,p) is a trick box. To open it, two plugs on either side of 
e cube must be pushed in, and then its center slides 
out of a frame formed by the other four sides. This inner 
box opens like a chest. Within it is a silver and aquama­
:-ine necklace (worth 125 gp) and a parchment packet 
· at holds three pinches of dust of disappearance. 
36. APARTMENT OF THE DUST OF AGES 
The floor of this room is covered with a layer of fine gray 
dust and ash, three inches deep. Across the room, oppo­
site where you entered, is another set of double doors. 
There are two empty alcoves to the north and south. On 
small ledges in each corner of the room are pieces of 
hat appear to be broken pottery. 
As you move into the room, your steps send motes of 
dust and ash swirling into the air, and these clouds form 
into shapes. 
First, from the ash, a dusty phantom assumes the 
shape of a woman. Her face is forlorn and tear-streaked . 
She throws up her hands in despair, rushes into one of 
:he alcoves, and disappears. 
Immediately afterward, two more dusty phantoms 
emerge-mighty warriors armed with jagged-edged 
swords and bearing fierce countenances . They move to 
olock the doorway opposite where you entered. 
: the characters approach the phantom guards, they 
:-aise their swords threateningly. But they can cause 
no harm, for they are just images of the long-dead past. 
c::-or as long as the characters remain in the room, other 
phantoms-in the shapes of priests, sages, and mourn­
ing young women-briefly form out of the dust and then 
dissipate. Moving through any of these phantom forms 
causes them to collapse. 37. BED OF XILONEN 
(Zeel-OAN-an) 
In the center of this room is a withered tree that looks 
like a leafless willow, rooted in a terraced depression. 
The bottom of this hollow is filled with oily water, a few 
inches deep. Across the room, beyond the dead tree, is 
another door. Around the sides of the room, a five-foot­
wide ledge encircles the tree. The walls of the room are 
beaded with condensation. 
The water in the bottom of the depression makes the 
floor in that area difficult terrain. 
Creature. The "tree" is Xilonen, a semisentient (Int 2), 
gigantic variety of polyp, similar to a sea anemone, once 
revered as the hairy mother goddess of corn. The polyp, 
which functions similarly to a roper, is very hungry. Its 
mouth is concealed among a nest of flailing tentacles 
and protected by sharp spines. 
Treasure. Within the polyp's gut are twelve pieces of 
blue jasper (worth 10 gp each) and a silvery rod, actually 
a copper-nickel alloy, which is a wand of lightning bolts. 
CHAPTER 3 I THE HIDDEN SHRINE OF TAMOACHAN 

--- PAGE 85 ---

38. BARRED PIT 
The walls of the passage glow magenta, bathing the cor­
ridor with a ghastly hue. After fifteen feet, the floor drops 
away to a pit that fills the hallway ahead. The pit is twen­
ty-five feet deep. Eight large, spidery bushes with thorny 
stems, white leaves, and enormous yellow blossoms 
grow across its bottom. 
Five feet beyond the nearest edge of the pit is a bronze 
bar, set level with the floor and embedded in the pit walls 
to either side. Farther out over the pit can be seen other 
similar bronze rungs, set at five-foot intervals. On the 
floor by the edge of the pit is a scattering of broken, rot­
ting wooden planks. 
Bridge of Bars. A character can attempt to cross this 
pit by leaping from one bar to the next. There are a total 
of eight bars and 45 feet of pit. Moving across the bars 
is akin to moving across difficult terrain; moving 5 feet 
onto a bar, or between two bars, costs 10 feet of move­
ment. If a creature attempts to move more than half of 
its base walking speed on any of its turns, it must make 
a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. On a successful 
check, the creature can keep moving. On a failed check, 
the creature stops moving to regain its balance and can 
move no farther on that turn. If the check fails by 5 or 
more, the creature falls into the pit. 
The third and sixth bars along the way are corroded. 
When a character moves onto one of these bars, roll a 
d20. On a roll of 5 or lower, or 2 or lower for a Small 
character, the bar breaks. If the bar doesn't break 
and the roll is 10 or lower, some obvious sign of the 
bar's weakness becomes evident, such as chipping 
or bending. 
Hazard. The bushes growing in the pit are carnivo­
rous thorn stingers (see appendix B). Each plant lies 
beneath one of the bronze bars and casts its projectiles 
directly upward against anyone attempting to traverse 
the bars. A creature balancing on a bar when it is hit by 
thorns must make a Dexterity saving throw with a DC 
of 6 + the damage taken. If the saving throw fails by 4 
or less, the creature falls prone, catching itself on the 
bar. (To stand up on the bar afterward, a character must 
make a Dexterity check as if attempting to move on the 
bars.) If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the charac­
ter falls in the pit. 
Someone who falls into the pit always comes down 
on a bush, cushioning the impact. The fall deals only 3 
(ld6) bludgeoning damage, but the character lands on a 
plant's adhesive blossoms. 
CHAPTER 3 I THE HIDDEN SHRINE OF TAMOACHAN 39. CHAMBER OF THE SECOND SUN 
Th s e or o s c~a'TIOer is thirty feet tall with mighty 
buttress1rg an.: a aulted ceiling. Parts of the ceiling and 
walls nave co a::ised. and raw earth has spilled down 
from a ga::iing nofe in the east wall. Crushed beneath 
a fallen bock in the center of the room are humanoid 
remains. Elsewhere around the floor are the chewed and 
decayed corpses of baboons. Through a hole in the east­
ern ceiling, daylight and fresh air filter in. Above, through 
this gap, can be seen four baboons. They jump around 
the hole and and scream in agitation, and as they do, dirt 
begins to slide down the banks and rocks in the walls 
shift slightly. 
There is no poison gas in the room, or in any of the up­
per areas (40 and higher), because the gas escapes out 
the hole in the ceiling. The floor is strewn with rubble, 
so it is difficult terrain. Larger rubble piles are 1 to 4 feet 
high. Any loud noise (such as an explosion, shouting , 
or fighting) causes a minor cave-in: at the start of each 
creature's next turn after the noise, that creature is sub­
jected to an attack from falling rocks and earth (+5 to 
hit, dealing 3 (ld6) bludgeoning damage on a hit). 
Creatures. Hidden in a pile of rubble in the center 
of the room is an amphisbaena -a giant, two-headed 
snake. It fights as a giant constrictor snake that can 
make two melee attacks on each of its turns, only one of 
which can be a Constrict attack. This ability increases 
its challenge rating to 3 (700 XP). 
If the snake is slain, the four baboons leap through 
the hole in the ceiling and down upon the party. (They 
remained outside the room because of their fear of 
the snake.) 
Treasure. The bones crushed beneath the fallen block 
belonged to two humans. This block can be moved by 
the combined effort of up to three characters with a 
total Strength of 30 or higher. A pouch tied on the waist 
of one corpse holds 40 ep. One of the humans wore a 
brooch of bronze and green quartz in the shape of a 
lizard (worth 25 gp). A silver and beryl-em erald ring (50 
gp) is worn on a bony finger. A silvery dagger, actually 
made of a copper-nickel alloy and worth 10 gp, is stuck 
in the left boot of one figure. A scroll case holds a map 
of the territory in which these ruins are located. Finally, 
a crystal sphere, cracked in the catastroph e, has rolled 
into the shadow of some nearby rubble. It is made of pol­
ished quartz, 3 inches in diameter , and is worth 45 gp. 
Crumbling Exit. If characters attempt to climb up 
the dirt embankments to the hole in the ceiling, they 
discover that the surface supports only 50 pounds. More 
weight than that on any space along the slope causes 
further collapse-each climber must succeed on a DC 

--- PAGE 86 ---

13 Dexterity saving throw or be buffeted b~ di -drub-
ble, taking 7 (3d4) bludgeoning damage. Iff e :a,e :ail 
by 5 or more, the rubble engulfs the digger comple ely 
and the trapped character can't breathe umil du!! ou . 
Getting out on one's own requires a succe fU: DC 1 -
trength (Athletics) check, and doing so takes 1 minute. 
Serpent Doors. The southeast exit from thi cham­
ber is a set of double bronze doors in the north wall at 
he end of a short corridor. Above them hangs a plaque 
inlaid with jade (worth 25 gp). The plaque depict a 
~vo-headed serpent, with its second head where its tail 
-hould be. 
LOCATIONS ON THE SECOND TIER 
:he staircase at area 40 provides access to the second 
•ier of the temple. The following locations are identified 
on map 3.1. 
.;.Q. DRAGON BREATH 
-,·hen the party reaches the bottom of the stairs, read: 
~ staircase leads upward into the gloom. It seems as 
hough you have found the entrance to another layer 
.vithin the complex. 
The second 10-foot square along these stairs is warded 
y magic like that of a glyph of warding spell (save DC 
· -). If the glyph is triggered, nothing happens until a 
reature moves onto the uppermost 5 feet of the stairs. 
· .·hen that occurs, a stone statue of a dragon, hidden in 
he secret room at the top of the stairs (see the "Second 
~ier" portion of the map), pops out and rolls forward to 
-he head of the steps. The statue has the statistics, de­
:enses, and traits of a stone golem, but it has no action 
_prions. As soon as it stops after emerging, it opens its 
outh and breathes a gust of steam 30 feet long and 10 
eet wide. Those in the area must make a DC 15 Consti­
ution saving throw, taking 7 (2d4 + 2) fire damage on a 
ailed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 
Thereafter, the statue breathes the next three times 
:: meone moves into or through the warded area. After 
-ur breaths, the statue retreats to its room and the door 
loses. (The statue's resting place is connected to a hot 
·ater geyser in the bedrock, through which it replen­
-hes itself.) 
Slippery Steps. After the statue breathes for the first 
me, the condensing steam makes the stairs slippery 
fficult terrain. A character who moves on the stairs 
:nust while they are slippery must succeed on a DC 10 
:Jexterity (Acrobatics) check or fall prone. 
Secret Door. If the characters get to the top of the 
;; airs without triggering the glyph, someone can dis­
over the secret door here with a successful DC 20 Wis­
-om (Perception) check. The door can't be opened from 
e outside, however. 41. FREE GOLD 
At the western end of this corridor is a pile of golden 
coins heaped on the floor. On top of the gold rests a 
skull missing its lower jaw. In the right eye socket, a black 
spider has made a home. Several bones are piled with 
the coins, and the hilt of a broken sword thrusts up from 
the mass. 
This apparent pile of gold is covered with a pale yellow 
dust. The entire pile of coins is actually yellow mold (see 
"Dungeon Hazards" in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Mas­
ter's Guide) covered by a permanent major image spell 
(save DC 15). The bones, spider, and sword hilt are real. 
Eastern Door. Close examination reveals that the 
stone in the center of the corridor is smoother than the 
surrounding wall. Because of this clue, it takes only a 
successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to find the 
secret door. The door can be opened by stepping forcibly 
upon an obvious cobblestone that is slightly raised from 
the floor. The door has two facing panels that pivot in­
ward when it is opened. 
Western Door. In front of the secret door is a dark 
stain on the floor, which makes the door as easy to find 
as the eastern one. This door swings on a horizontal 
pivot in the middle of the slab. Pushing in at either the 
top or the bottom of this secret panel causes the oppo­
site end to swing outward, providing enough space to 
crawl through into the secret passage beyond. 
CHAPTER 3 I THE HIDDEN SHRINE OF TAMOACHAN 

--- PAGE 87 ---

86 42. THE CHAPEL OF KUKULKA N 
(Koo-KOOL-kahn , the feathered serpent) 
Beyond the secret door, the passage bends around to the 
left. At the end of a narrow corridor hangs an ornate mir­
ror, and a door is set in the eastern wall next to it. 
Magic Mirror. The first creature to come within 10 
feet of the mirror at the end of the corridor must make 
a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed check, the 
creature believes that it is in deadly combat with a feath­
ered warrior that has emerged from the mirror. This 
effect is like that of a phantasmal force spell, with the 
character battling a warrior that has a +6 bonus to hit 
and deals 3 (ld6) psychic damage, as described in the 
spell. The effect ends if the affected creature deals the 
imaginary warrior a total amount of damage equal to 
the creature's own hit point maximum. 
While under the effect of this magic, the creature is 
actually paralyzed, appearing to others as if it were just 
standing there staring into the mirror. If someone dis­
turbs the affected creature, that creature can repeat the 
saving throw, ending the effect on a successful save. 
The Door. When anyone get close to the door, read: 
The door seems to be very heavy, and it has many glyphs 
carved upon it. In the center of the door is carved an 
eagle killing a serpent. Two stone warriors dressed in 
loincloths and wearing panther masks are sculpted into 
the door posts. 
The glyphs on the door tell a story in ancient Olman of 
a journey to find truth and light, which ended in failure 
and imprisonment in the land of the dead. 
The door opens outward. When the characters pass 
through the doorway, read: 
Beyond the door is a wide foyer that leads into a circular 
room. On the south wall of this hall is a jade death mask 
affixed at chest height. 
Taking up the middle of the chamber is a cross-shaped 
dais with sets of stairs leading up to it along each of the 
four ends. In the center of the dais rises a cylindrical 
structure that appears to be made of transparent walls of 
crystal enclosing an oddly carved, stone pillar. 
The stairs that face the room's entrance are carved 
with the heads of many gods. The steps on the north side 
are bloodstained, and atop the landing stands a statue 
of a warrior. The stairs to the east, across the room, are 
partly obscured by shadow. The southern staircase is lu­
minescent , appearing to change colors in the light. 
CHAPTER 3 I THE HIDDEN SHRINE OF TAMOACHAN --c ed into each nook where the arms of the cross 
::i e together is a low shelf on which are placed small 
dfe• 11gs: silver bracelets, earrings, neck collars, anklets, 
:, es of coral beads, and silver and jade statuettes. 
Trapped Mask. The mask (worth 25 gp) is the trig­
ger to a trap. If the mask is taken off the wall, the lever 
it hangs on pivots up and three sets of iron bars drop, 
caging whoever is in the square in front of the mask. 
The bars are old, and they can be bent or lifted away 
from the floor with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athlet­
ics) check. 
Trapped Treasure. If any of the items on the shelves 
(worth a total of 450 gp) are touched, the exit door seals 
with an effect like that of an arcane lock spell, requiring 
the use of magic or a successful DC 25 Strength (Athlet­
ics) check to force the door open. 
Creature. Coiled about the pillar, trapped within the 
magic walls of the crystal cylinder surrounding it, is a 
couatl. Because of its especially potent Shielded Mind 
trait, it is effectively invisible. 
If the characters disturb any of the items on the 
shelves, the couatl speaks to the party in Common, its 
voice seeming to come from everywhere in the chamber. 
"Interlopers, you have trespassed on my sacred chapel. 
For this affront, retribution has already begun, for you are 
now breathing a toxic gas which will kill you shortly. It is 
possible your actions were not from malice or greed, but 
just idle curiosity. Therefore, you will find the cure upon 
the stone in the middle of the dais, if you can solve the 
puzzle to reach it by the proper route. Choose your path 
wisely, and act quickly." 
There is actually no poison gas in the room, but as 
the characters spend time in here trying to get to the 
cure, describe how they seem to be getting weaker and 
weaker. They should feel as if time is running out. 
Aura. A detect magic spell reveals an aura of evoca­
tion magic emanating from inside the crystal cylinder. 
The Right Path. To reach the "cure," the characters 
must first face the challenge of ascending the northern 
steps, where the warrior stands. The warrior, a helmed 
horror, animates and attacks when it is approached. 
Once the construct is defeated, the characters can pro­
ceed to the center of the dais. 
A character who attempts to reach the dais another 
way has no luck: 
• Someone who tries climbing up the shelves takes 2 
(ld4) force damage and is pushed back 10 feet. 
• The heads carved into the western stairs babble when 
a character steps on them. That character feels too 
weak to continue, and sits down until helped away 
from the stairs. 
• The eastern stairs are shrouded in dim light, which 
can't be made brighter by any means. Any character 

--- PAGE 88 ---

who mounts the stairs falls down and roll omo 
the floor, taking 3 (ld6) bludgeoning damage. 
The southern stairs change color constaml: .. .\nyone 
who tries to ascend them makes no progre though 
they can be descended normally). 
Once the characters reach the crystal cylinder, the 
·ouatl again speaks to them, still hidden from sight: 
• "So you have passed the first test. Perhaps you are not 
:he fools you first seemed. But it will take the best tool 
of your most clever person to breach these crystal walls. 
Your time is running out." 
.,.he surface of the crystal cylinder is cold to the touch 
and impervious to all blows. The enclosure has no 
;sible gaps. 
A gap appears in the wall if someone who has profi. 
iency with thieves' tools touches the tools to the surface 
,;ch the intention of finding a portal or a lock. The play­
ers might come up with other valid solutions , such as a 
·izard (clever person) touching the crystal with a wand 
ool). It's up to you which alternative attempts work. 
Cure in Sight. By the time the characters reach the 
;iillar inside the cylinder, they feel very weak. On the top 
f the pillar in front of them is a potion bottle, but an in­
ible barrier prevents anyone from touching it. A glyph 
etched into the side of the pillar just below the bottle. 
One more time the couatl speaks, its voice now seeming 
:o come from the stone: 
• "So you have reached my altar, but your time is nearly 
exhausted and the cure is just beyond your reach. Trust 
,our souls to the gods, foolish mortals." 
The top of the pillar is shielded by a wall of force that 
must be breached to reach the potion bottle. The wall 
·an be destroyed by a disintegrate spell or by damaging 
the glyph inscribed below it. If someone pours holy wa­
·er on the glyph, touches it with a holy symbol, or casts a 
divine spell on it, the wall of force disappears. 
Aftermath. When the characters claim the potion 
bottle, the couatl becomes visible and flies out into 
he chamber. If the characters immediately attack it, 
me couatl calls them ingrates and fools, and then at­
tacks back. 
If the characters don't attack, the couatl smiles and 
tlianks them for freeing it from its long imprisonment. 
Treasure. Inside the bottle is a potion of healing. The 
mask, if it is claimed, weighs 30 pounds and is worth 
25 gp. Miscellaneous items on the shelves have a total 
:alue of 450 gp. 
Special Treasure. If the couatl and the characters are 
'Jn good terms at the end of the encounter, the couatl 
provides them with special treasures: a balance of har­
mony (see appendix A) and the gems needed to operate 
t. a mirror of the past (see appendix A), and a periapt of 
:1-ound closure. In addition, if the characters ask, the couatl might be 
willing to use its spells to help the party. It has been im­
prisoned a long time and doesn't know anything about 
the ruins. It returns to the celestial planes after giving 
the characters their rewards. 
43. THE SMOKING MIRRORS 
An amber haze drifts in this room, which is unoccu­
pied. Strangely shaped and colored mirrors hang on 
the walls, and a large, oblong stone basin stands in the 
middle of the floor. The basin is about ten feet long, five 
feet wide, and three feet tall. It is filled with a steaming 
golden liquid . 
The red mirror on the eastern wall seems to be com­
posed of fiery glass and framed in bronze. Light beams 
are broken by the mirror into myriad flames, and ghostly 
shapes seem to flicker in its depths. 
On the northern wall are two mirrors: a striking black 
one of obsidian framed in lacquered wood, and a stark 
white mirror with a wrought iron frame. The black mirror 
has a distinctive earthy odor and the blackness of subter­
ranean caverns, but it seems of crude construction and 
reflects objects only when they are close to it. The white 
mirror has a pungent odor of nutmeg and spice, and its 
depths are gelid and smoky. 
The mirror that hangs on the western wall is in a stone 
frame and is blue in color. Reflections in this mirror rip­
ple as if the viewer were looking into a pool of water. 
Red Mirror. A creature that looks into the red mirror 
sees a ghostly white form next to its own reflection. This 
mirror falsely predicts the viewer's death. The ghostly 
image takes on the appearance of a monster or a trap 
from this adventure. The image then assaults and kills 
the viewer's reflection. The mirror functions only once 
per character; after a character has this vision, the mir­
ror becomes a normal mirror for that individual. 
A creature that touches the red mirror for the first 
time on a turn takes 2 (ld4) fire damage. 
Black Mirror. A creature that looks into the black mir­
ror sees its reflection blur and then reappear in ancient 
garb as if depicting a previous incarnation. The image 
says, in Olman, "Command me to answer, and I shall." 
The image of a long-dead Olman is superimposed on 
the character 's reflection. A command spell can cause 
the spirit to answer three yes-or-no questions (the one­
word command is "Answer"). The spirit answers only 
questions spoken in Olman, and nods or shakes its head 
in response. 
Any creature that touches the black mirror must 
succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw, or all valu­
able metals and gems in its possession turn into lead 
and glass. 
White Mirror. Reflections in the white mirror are 
blurred by what looks like a fine mist. Any creature that 
steps before this mirror and looks into it must make a 
CHAPTER 3 I THE HIDDEN SHRINE OF TAMOACHAN 

--- PAGE 89 ---

88 successful DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned 
until the end of the creature's next turn. If the saving 
throw fails, the mirror, which is really an ochre jelly of 
unusual color, comes out of the frame and falls upon the 
character. Behind this false mirror is a door, which can 
be opened once the jelly is removed. 
Blue Mirror. The mirror on the western wall is ac­
tually a window of magical glass that offers a view of a 
pool of water. Any character who touches the glass must 
succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be drawn 
through the glass, becoming submerged in the water. 
Weapons can be used to break the glass (AC 15, 20 hit 
points). If the glass is destroyed, the water in the pool 
and those trapped in it spill out into the room. 
Golden Liquid. Any nonmagical object immersed in 
the basin reacts with the fluid inside, which turns the 
object into gold for 1 hour. If any of the golden liquid is 
removed from the basin, it becomes colored water. 
44. SUN OF MOTION 
In the center of this diamond-shaped room is a dais on 
which a weirdly formed altar rests. The altar is made to 
resemble a many-armed and beaked octopus-like crea­
ture with a large purple-red stone its forehead. The altar 
and floor are covered with dust. The walls of the room 
are decorated with paintings of the sun and moon in mo­
tion. Other images show people standing about a temple 
making sacrifices of flesh and blood, while the figure of a 
priest holds the heart of his latest victim above his head. 
Trapped Altar. The altar radiates an aura of trans­
mutation magic if detect magic is cast on it. Any crea­
ture that touches the octopus figure sticks to the stone, 
becoming grappled (escape DC 15). Once a creature 
is stuck, the octopus-altar starts to spin, dragging the 
victim about the room. Within 1 round, the speed is too 
great for the victim to maintain footing, and the creature 
is dragged and bashed about, taking 3 (ld6) bludgeon­
ing damage at the end of each of its turns. A creature 
that comes free while the altar is spinning tumbles away 
from it and takes another 2 (ld4) bludgeoning damage. 
The gem in the center of the altar has AC 17 and 15 hit 
points. If it is destroyed , the altar stops spinning and the 
character is released. The gem is a cursed stone, but it 
appears to be a jewel of value, and it can be pried from 
the altar. If the gem comes in contact with a creature's 
flesh, that creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom 
saving throw or be affected as if by an Otto's irresistible 
dance spell, going into a spinning dance that lasts until 
the stone is released. To let go of the stone willingly, 
the creature must be the target of magic that removes a 
curse or breaks an enchantment. 
If the creature dances for a number of minutes equal 
to its Constitution score, it must succeed on a DC 10 
Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaus­
tion. The creature repeats the saving throw whenever 
the same number of minutes elapses again, suffering 
one more level of exhaustion on a failed save. 
CHAPTER 3 I THE HIDDEN SHRINE OF TAMOACHAN 45. ~ICTLAN 
(\Jeek-TLAN, Land of the Dead) 
-s room is decorated with a bizarre diorama depicting 
: eland of the dead. Small, brightly painted clay statues 
have been placed about the room to represent the inhab­
itants of this realm and the unfortunate people they have 
taken ,nto their care. 
In the center of the room, the floor rises to form a 
small hill. A group of small figures seem to be struggling 
to roll a boulder up the hill, while a devil drives them on. 
Above the hill in the ceiling is a glowing spot that illumi­
nates the entire chamber with an eerie silver light. 
A cobblestone path leads from the western door to the 
foot of the hill. A similar path runs eastward and then 
veers south. Sections of the diorama around the perime­
ter of the room depict different environments in the land 
of the dead. 
In the western end of the room is a region of burning 
sands. There devils torture those who have been unfortu­
nate enough to fall into their hands. 
Along the southern side is a grassy plain where people 
frolic and hunt antelope and deer. 
North of the grassy plain and south of the hill, the 
floor opens into a model of a canyon. A river of lava flows 
down it while flames lick the walls. 
East of the hill, in a side area of the room, is a counter­
part to this fiery canyon-an icy waste. 
To the north of the hill is a putrid, bubbling marsh 
where figures strive to keep their heads above 
the surface. 
From out of the marsh a black, torpid river wends its 
way past the northern edge of the hill and flows west to 
pour over the lip of a steam-filled chasm in the northwest 
comer of the room. Within this dark chasm, worms pur­
sue the fleeing forms of naked people. 
In the south comer of the room on the eastern wall is a 
barred door. 
The light in the ceiling comes from the walls of a chute 
that glows in the dark. The chimney can be reached by 
someone who climbs on the shoulders of another char­
acter, but to enter it, the character must brace back and 
legs against opposite walls because there are no protu­
berances to hold onto. The steeply inclined passage be­
yond is full of cobwebs and leads eventually to area 48. 
Each section of the diorama in this room has a mag­
ical aspect that affects any creatures that walk into the 
region. If the effect isn't instantaneous and isn't related 
to a spell, it can be dispelled with dispel magic cast as a 
5th-level spell (or at a level stated in the effect). A crea­
ture on which a region's effect is dispelled is immune to 
the effect for 1 minute. 

--- PAGE 90 ---

The two paths are free of magical effect . If cha.-a er 
\·eer off the paths, either unwittingly or wi h · e i ·en of 
exploring, apply the effects described belo \. ace ~ding 
o the areas they enter. Unless otherwis e no ed. crea­
ures can leave an area whenever they de ire. by either 
moving onto one of the paths or into an adjacen area. 
Hill. A magical force pushes those who climb to the 
op of the hill in a random direction. A creature that 
ends its turn on top of the hill must succeed on a DC 15 
trength saving throw or be pushed 5 feet off the top of 
·he hill and knocked prone. If a creature slips. roll a d4 
:o see which direction it rolls off the hill. 
Burning Sands. Any creature that ends its turn in this 
region must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving 
·hrow or start to bleed profusely from the nose. This 
hemorrhaging causes a loss of 1 hit point at the end of 
each of the creature's turns thereafter. If the creature 
.eaves the area, the bleeding stops at the end of its 
next turn. 
Grassy Plain. Any creature that enters this region 
must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or 
:-efuse to leave it. A creature affected by the magic is 
allowed another Wisdom saving throw every 24 hours 
. -bile the magic persists. A creature can repeat the 
saving throw every time it takes damage. If companions 
outside the area try to talk the creature into leaving, you 
can decide to allow the victim another saving throw. In 
any case, each time the saving throw is repeated, the DC 
ncreases by 1. 
Flames. Creatures that enter this section are affected 
a if by a heat metal spell cast at 3rd level (save DC 15). 
Jee. Creatures that enter this area are affected as if by 
3rd-level heat metal spell (save DC 15), but the damage 
-cold instead of fire, and the creature has no chance of 
ropping a chilled object. 
M~arshes. Any creature that enters this area feels a 
:hortness of breath after 3 rounds and begins to suffo­
:ate after 3 more rounds. 
River. Those who enter the river for the first time on a 
· .irn must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw 
r forget how they came to be here and why they are 
ere. A spellcaster also forgets how to cast one level of 
~pells for each point by which the saving throw is failed, 
-·arting with the highest level the character knows. 
Forgotten spells can be prepared again. Dispel magic 
oesn't remove this effect, but remove curse or greater 
--estoration can. 
Pit of the Worms. Any character who enters this re­
;ion must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or 
e affected as if by a fear spell. 
-:-6.TLAZOTEOTL 
:laz-ohl-TAH-oh-tel , mother goddess of the earth) 
Beyond the door is a modest-sized room with a lumpy 
:,1 e of earthy material in the middle of the floor. Across 
'rom the door in the southeast corner, a glazed flask 
,ests on a small shelf. In the northwest and northeast 
corners are two more shelves on which rest a smal urn 
and a thin stone cylinder. Creature. When any character starts into this room 
the pile of earth, which is a gibbering mouther , opens 
one eye, and then another and another, until many 
eyes of different shapes and sizes stare at the party. All 
about the eyes are fanged, drooling mouths that begin 
a cacophony of babbling. The creature attacks until de­
stroyed but doesn't leave the room. 
Treasure. The flask contains a dried potion of hill 
giant strength. The stone cylinder is a +J rod of the 
pact keeper. 
The urn holds the dried heart of a mighty yuan-ti that 
radiates transmutation magic if detect magic is used 
on it. Any character who eats the entire thing gains the 
permanent ability to understand the speech of snakes 
and yuan-ti. 
47. SPIDER IN HIDING 
Creature. In a web-covered opening in the wall of the 
steeply inclined chute, 30 feet above the where the lower 
end meets the ceiling of area 45, lurks a giant spider. 
The spider's lair is 10 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 4 feet 
tall. A character must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom (Per­
ception) check to notice the tunnel or its occupant before 
the spider attacks. If the spider paralyzes its prey, it re­
treats into its lair with the prey to feed. 
In the Chute. The cramped quarters of the tunnel im­
pose disadvantage on weapon attack rolls. 
Also, a creature in the chute struck by the spider must 
succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity or Strength saving throw 
(player's choice). On a failed save, the creature slips 
down the chute 5 feet for every point by which the saving 
throw failed. If a creature falls 30 feet, it plummets out 
of the chute, taking falling damage accordingly and roll-
CHAPTER 3 THE HIDDEN SHRINE OF rAMOACHAN 89 

--- PAGE 91 ---

90 ing in a random direction (roll a d4) after landing prone 
in area 45. The spider pursues prey into the chute, but is 
unlikely to emerge to fight in an open area. 
Upper End. The top of this passage is covered with 
a pewter basin, which requires a successful DC 10 
Strength (Athletics) check to move. 
LOCATIONS ON THE THIRD TIER 
The tunnel that leads up from area 45 opens onto the 
third tier of the temple. The following locations are iden­
tified on map 3.1. 
48. HOUND OF THE BAT 
The description below assumes that the characters 
entered the room by traveling through the chute and 
pushing aside the pewter cover. The tunnel comes out 
at the bottom of a stone ring that, from inside the room, 
resembles a well. (If they entered from the west, the 
pewter cover is still in place.) 
This room is small and plainly decorated. On the north 
and south sides are fountains made of bronze-inlaid 
marble. The southern one is cracked, and only dry limy 
deposits remain in it. The northern one contains about 
two feet of dark water, fed by a trickle that falls from the 
top of the fountain. In the water, the white, gauzy form of 
a crayfish lies on a bed of lime encrustations . 
To the west, stairs lead up out of the room, and to 
either side of the stairs along the west wall are narrow, 
dust covered ledges. 
Creature. The fouled water in the fountain contains a 
neutral evil water weird. It rises up and attacks charac­
ters who disturb the water. 
Treasure. The "crayfish" is nothing more than the 
shed shell of a long-expired resident of the fountain. Be­
neath it is a platinum key and chain (worth 20 gp). The 
key unlocks the portcullis that blocks the exit in area 53. 
49. SACRED CHITZA-ATLAN 
(SHEET-zah AY-tlan) 
In the middle of this chamber is what appears to be the 
withered, preserved form of a centaur mounted on a 
slab of marble. Tinted green and decked out in lacquered 
leather, feathers, and copper wire jewelry, he faces the 
western entrance to this chamber. The centaur holds a 
bronze-hafted pike tipped with a broad, blue-gray, flame­
shaped spearhead. 
Scattered around the room are jewelry and knick­
knacks, made of beaten copper, cut and polished obsid­
ian, shells, quartz, and coral. Much of this treasure is at 
the feet of the centaur, symbolically being trod under­
foot. Two tall urns shaped like wicker baskets stand along 
the north wall, each one filled with river stones. 
CHAPTER 3 I THE HIDDEN SHRINE OF TAMOACHAN Creature. The centaur figure is the mummified re­
main of a sacred offspring of Chitza-Atlan, the guard­
ian of the gateway to the underworld. This guardian has 
two functions: to prevent any but the dead from entering 
the e ruins, and to keep those creatures in the ruins 
confined there. Thus, if any character tries to exit this 
room by any door other than the one entered from, the 
centaur mummy (see appendix B) animates and attacks 
the character s. The mummy will also defend itself if 
attacked. A word or a pass from Zotzilaha will gain 
free passage. 
Treasure. If all thejunkjewelry is taken (eight hun­
dred pieces), the total value of the haul is 80 gp. The real 
treasure is concealed in the bottoms of the two urns. 
Buried beneath the stones are two crushed silver masks 
(worth 25 gp each), an electrum serpent bracelet (worth 
50 gp), a broken marble statue of a monkey (50 gp), and 
four silver hairpins set with jade worth (5 gp each). 
50. JADE WALL 
I Here a wall of green, polished stone blocks the way. 
This wall, which is 7 feet wide and 7 feet tall, is a trap 
for those attempting to break into the ruins. If any tam­
pering is done to the wall, it falls west out into the ante­
room. If the wall falls on a creature, the creature must 
make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, 
the creature takes 9 (2d8) bludgeoning damage and is 
knocked prone under the wall, restrained. A successful 
DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check is needed to lift the 
stone wall off any trapped beneath it. 
51. WIND TUNNEL 
This five-foot-diameter passage is dry and dusty, and it 
shows no sign of having been used for ages. Near the top 
of the corridor walls, about three feet from the ceiling, 
stone lintels run the length of the passage. The corridor 
abruptly widens to a cube fifteen feet on a side with a 
corrugated floor. In the ceiling of this area, a bronze, cir­
cular trapdoor is set. The cover is latched shut. 
In the four corners of this foyer are sets of metal rungs 
forming a ladder that leads up and across the arched 
ceiling to the trapdoor. The rungs are broken in several 
places, leaving rusty spikes. On the other side of this 
area, the corridor continues. 
Hazardous Hatch. Opening the hatch releases a 
whirlwind. The character who climbed up to open the 
hatch is hurled to the floor and takes 3 (ld6) bludgeon­
ing damage as the wind emerges and fills the 15-foot 
chamber. Thereafter , it costs 3 feet of speed to move 1 
foot in the room. The hatch can't be shut, and the wind 
doesn't die down. 
Each creature that starts its turn in this area must 
make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. (A character 
grasping the rungs of one of the ladders has advantage I 

--- PAGE 92 ---

on the saving throw.) On a failed save, the \\i 
the creature 10 feet in a random direction. e c-ea· e 
takes 3 (ld6) bludgeoning damage, and it i · oc ·ed 
prone. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, e crea­
ure strikes one of the rusty spikes, taking an addi ·onal 
3 (ld6) slashing damage. 
If a target thrown by the wind strikes an object. uch 
as a wall, the target takes another 3 (ld6) bludgeoning 
damage. If a target is thrown into another creature. 
hat creature must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity sav­
'ng throw or take 3 (ld6) bludgeoning damage and be 
R11ocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes 
alf the bludgeoning damage and isn't knocked prone. 
A creature that moves only by crawling on the floor, 
ing the corrugated surface to maintain one's grip, is 
safe from the wind. 
52. THE HIDDEN ROOM OF NAHUAL 
. 'AH-wahl, alter ego) 
_-\ character can discover one of the secret doors to this 
:-oom by succeeding on a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) 
-heck. Each door can be opened by reaching up above 
.·. grabbing the lintel or the molding on the wall about 
-feet above the floor, and pulling down. The secret 
oor then swings inward, but it closes 30 seconds later. 
These doors are counterweighted and can't be spiked 
pen. From the inside, either of the doors can be opened 
y pressing down on a stone projection to the right of it. 
When the characters exit one of the antechambers 
and pass into the room beyond, read: 
~he walls of this chamber are painted flat black, while 
·rie floor is inlaid with a colorful mosaic of strange gods 
cavorting and leaping around a sun. An alcove in the 
center of the eastern wall is masked by a curtain of shells 
and beads. 
the characters push aside the curtain, read: 
Behind the curtain is the chalky form of a statue seated 
on a stone throne with its surface carved to depict feath­
ers. The statue is wearing a feathered headdress and a 
reathered robe. Lying across its lap in its open palms is a 
scepter of gold and silver with an eagle's head crafted on 
one end and the talons of a bird holding a blazing sun on 
•rie other. The most remarkable thing about the statue is 
rs face. 
~he statue duplicates the face of the first person who en­
·ers this room. The scepter is worth 200 gp. It is stuck to 
· e palms of the statue, and only the character with the 
same face as the statue can lift the scepter. 
Once that character picks up the scepter, it provides 
· holder with visions of great battles of the past. The 
older is transfixed by the visions; others see the char­
ter lose focus and begin to sweat. After 30 seconds, if till holding the scepter, the holder becomes petrified. At 
the same time, the statue becomes flesh and blood. 
Creature. The figure on the throne is a nahual, or 
alter-ego. It is essentially a doppelganger of chaotic 
evil alignment that is also a fiend (demon). It possesses 
the memories of the petrified character and tries to 
convince the party that it has just merged with the spirit 
of one of the character's earlier incarnations . Given 
a chance, the nahual leads the party to their deaths 
with false information gained from "memories " of its 
former life. 
The nahual must be slain and the scepter touched to 
the nahual's corpse to restore the petrified character. A 
greater restoration spell also works, before or after the 
nahual has been slain. 
53. THE VALVE 
Before you is a foyer, ten feet wide and twenty feet long. 
A narrow hall connects with this area on the south side, 
and on the north end a five-foot-wide staircase leads up. 
A wheel is set horizontally half into the wall in the 
southwest corner. This wheel appears to be a crank. 
Above the wheel, a bronze lever is set in the wall, angled 
downward.

--- PAGE 93 ---

92 Open and Shut. The stairs lead up to a blank wall 
that is the location of a secret door. This door can be 
opened by turning the wheel in the foyer. The wheel 
turns only after the lever is pushed up, and then only in 
one direction. Rotating the wheel opens the secret door, 
but it also opens the floor in front of the wheel to reveal 
a 10-foot-square pit, at the bottom of which can be seen 
a pale shimmer of bones. There is a 1-foot-wide ledge 
along the west edge of the pit for someone to stand on 
while working the wheel, and a 6-inch-wide footbridge 
of polished marble spans the center of the pit from 
west to east. 
Crossing this beam, which is difficult terrain, requires 
a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. On a failed check, 
the character can't move farther during that turn. If the 
check fails by 5 or more, the character falls off the beam 
30 feet to the bottom of the pit. 
If the crank is released once the secret door is open, 
it unwinds quickly, pulling the door shut. To prevent 
this, the lever can be pulled down to lock the wheel in 
place-but doing so causes a portcullis to fall across the 
entrance to the stairs. The portcullis can be lifted by a 
character who succeeds on a DC 20 Strength (Athlet­
ics) check. 
Easy Way Out. If the characters search the walls be­
side the portcullis, a keyhole can be discovered. The key 
from room 48 fits the lock, enabling the portcullis to be 
opened like a gate. 
Hard Way Out. In the ceiling directly above the pit, a 
thin slab that looks like ordinary stonework conceals a 
sloping tunnel that leads upward. The slab can't be de­
tected or manipulated from this side. 
TEMPLE GROUNDS 
The inset on map 3.1 depicts what is left of the shrine at 
ground level. 
54. TEMPLE RUIN 
This was apparently a large temple of some sort. Once 
a major building, all that remains are the back wall and 
enough of the roof to shelter the altar. All else seems 
closed off by fallen debris. Several pillars have fallen and 
they litter the floor. Sunlight filters through holes in the 
roof, thirty-five feet overhead, which is a maze of chips 
and cracks. The back wall is covered by a bas-relief of a 
giant bat-thing, nine feet tall, with a wingspan of twenty 
feet. In front of this wall is an altar stone, carved to rep­
resent a mass of squirming rats, weasels, and worms. 
On the front of the altar is the head of a screaming bat. 
Jutting above the altar on either side are a pair of sharp­
edged, metal bat-wings, eight feet long. The floor in front 
of the altar is worn smooth. 
Field of Rubble. The temple area is filled with debris 
that offers no obvious passage to the interior. In the cen­
ter of the south edge is an area where rubble is heaped 
CHAPTER 3 I THE HIDDEN SHRINE OF TAMOACHAN m-er an opening that seems to lead down deeper into the 
debris. It i haky and can be collapsed easily-any force 
applied to the heap by a creature with Strength 15 or 
higher will bring the rocks down. This rubble can also 
be caused to collapse by hurting a weighty object at it or 
using a spell such as thunderwave to create the needed 
force. Those within 10 feet of the collapse must succeed 
on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or take 5 (2d4) blud­
geoning damage from falling debris. 
Climbing elsewhere on the debris causes a minor 
collapse. dealing 2 (ld4) bludgeoning damage to each 
climber. Each climber must also succeed on a DC 13 
Dexterity saving throw or be buried by the debris, tak­
ing 7 (3d4) more bludgeoning damage. If the saving 
throw fails by 5 or more, the debris engulfs the digger 
completely, and the trapped character can't breathe until 
dug out. Struggling out on one's own requires a success­
ful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check, and doing so takes 
1 minute. Any of these sorts of collapses open no access 
to the inside. 
Fragile Roof. Each time a creature ends its turn on 
the portion of the roof that remains standing, there is 
a 20 percent chance that the roof beneath its feet gives 
way. The creature falls 35 feet, to the rubble below, tak­
ing 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage. 
Trapdoor Entrance. If the characters begin their 
investigations of the hidden shrine by arriving at the 
temple, they need to find a way in. One route is by way of 
a trapdoor in the floor about 10 feet in front of the altar. 
A character can discover the seam of the door with a 
successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. Any crea­
ture that walks across the top of the door has a 1-in-12 
chance of triggering it, for the mechanism is old, and 
long disuse has made it unreliable. Any skilled charac­
ter's reasonable attempt to keep the door from opening 
works. Forcing the door to stay open requires a suc­
cessful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. The trapdoor 
opens onto a slide that emerges above the pit in area 53. 
Anyone who slides down the tunnel to the hidden hatch 
at the other end is dumped into that room. 
Secret Entrance. The second way to enter the tombs 
below is through a secret door hidden behind the left 
wing of the giant bat-thing carved upon the wall. A char­
acter can locate the door with a successful DC 20 Wis­
dom (Perception) check. 
The door can be opened if a character places a limb 
into the mouth of the carving. If this occurs, the mouth 
clamps shut; the teeth puncture the limb, dealing 11 
(2d10) piercing damage; and a giant batwing folds out 
from the wall to reveal the passage. A creature trapped 
in the bat's mouth is grappled (escape DC 12) but 
doesn't take further damage. 
The mechanical nature of the latch becomes appar­
ent to any creature that examines the mouth of the bat 
sculpture and succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (Inves­
tigation) check. If the check succeeds by 10 or more, 
the creature deduces that the function of the mouth can 
be activated by placing any object (not necessarily an 
extremity) into it. This information can also be obtained 
by a creature that examines the mouth further and then 
succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. 

--- PAGE 94 ---

Once the wing has moved to reveal the secret door, 
: ,·eils the lower half of the carving's face and the bat's 
lack eyes start to glow. Any character who looks at 
· em must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw 
-r be paralyzed. A creature can repeat the saving throw 
the end of each minute or whenever it takes damage, 
ending the effect on itself on a successful save. The 
::!feet ends after 1 hour, or earlier if any magical light is 
shone on the altar. 
Development. After the secret door to the shrine is 
pened, a giant hyena moves into this area. It makes a 
.air behind a fallen pillar to the east, waiting to ambush 
ny who emerge back through the door. 
Hinged Altar Trap. Close inspection of the altar re-
eals handholds along the front side and hinges at the 
ack, indicating that the altar can be lifted from the 
·ront and tipped on its side. This can be accomplished 
0• the combined effort of up to three characters with 
total Strength of 30 or higher. If the altar is lifted 
uickly by characters in a standing position, the metal 
·ings whip through an arc from the sides of the altar 
·o the front center about 4 feet off the floor. Each wing's 
ading edge is razor-sharp. Anyone in the path of a 
ing must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw 
-r take 13 (3d8) slashing damage. If a wing misses its 
.::rst target, it sweeps past that creature with the possi­
ility of striking another creature along the same path. If the altar is tilted by characters while they are in a 
kneeling position, the wings whistle harmlessly over­
head. The other way to avoid the trap is by being careful 
in the lifting. 
The mechanism for the trap is inside the altar. Char­
acters who lift the altar slowly and look underneath it 
can easily spot the levers and joints that connect with 
the bladed wings. The characters can prop the altar up, 
enabling someone to crawl under and disable the trap. 
Doing that requires 10 minutes of work and a successful 
DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. 
Treasure. Beneath the altar is an 8-foot-deep pit in 
which are many items of value and two bodies cut in 
half. The treasure is very bulky. Resting on and buried 
in a pile of 20,000 silver pieces are the following items: 
fifty silver chased goblets (worth 5 gp each), twenty 
gold-plated statuettes (10 gp apiece), forty embossed 
silver chalices and servings (5 gp each), eighty pieces 
of jewelry (5 gp apiece), fifty mother-of-pearl pieces 
(1 gp each), a jade placard bearing the image of Zot -
zilaha (100 gp), and a marble statue of a reclining fig. 
ure (50 gp). 
It is very likely that if large portions of this treasure 
are taken, Zotzilaha finds out about it and sends a vam­
pire or a giant bat to seek retribution. 'ft

WHITE PLUME MOUNTAIN 
HITE PLUME MOUNTAIN HAS ALWAYS 
been a subject of superstiti ou awe 
to the neighboring villagers. People 
still travel many miles to gaze upon 
this natural wonder, though few will 
approach it closely, as it is reputed to 
be the haunt of various demons and 
devils. The occasional disappearance 
of those who stray too close to the 
~.ume reinforces this belief. 
Thirteen hundred years ago, the wizard Keraptis was 
;,earching for a suitable haven where he could indulge 
eccentricities without fear of interference. He visited 
"hite Plume Mountain, going closer than most dared 
o. and discovered the system of old lava-tubes that 
:ddle the cone and the underlying strata. With a little 
reration, he thought, these would be perfect for his 
urposes. The area already had a bad reputation, and 
~e could think of a few ways to make it worse. So he dis­
ppeared below White Plume Mountain and vanished 
om the knowledge of the surface world. 
Today, the once-feared name of Keraptis is not widely 
· own even among learned scholars. Or it was not 
idely known, that is, until several weeks ago, when 
-· ee highly valued magic weapons named Wave, 
, helm, and Blackrazor disappeared from the vaults of 
eir owners. Rewards were posted, servants hanged, 
= :en the sanctuary of the thieves' guild was violated in 
· e frantic search for the priceless arms, but not even 
a ingle clue was turned up until the weapons' former 
·ners each received a copy of the following note: 
Search ye far or search ye near 
You'll find no trace of the three 
Unless you follow instructions clear 
For the weapons abide with me. 
. orth past forest, farm and furrow 
You must go to the feathered mound 
Then down away from the sun you'll burrow 
Forget life, forget light, forget sound. 
To rescue Wave, you must do battle 
With the Beast in the Boiling Bubble 
Crost cavern vast, where chain-links rattle 
Lies Whelm, past water-spouts double. 
Blackrazor yet remains to be won 
Underneath inverted ziggurat. 
That garnered, think not that you're done 
For now you'll find you are caught 
I care not, former owners brave 
What heroes you seek to hire. 
Though mighty, I'll make each one my slave 
Or send him to the fire . 
. -\II the notes were signed with the symbol of Kera pt is. White Plume Mountain has tentatively been identi­
fied as the "feathered mound" of the poem. The former 
owners of Wave, Whelm, and Blackrazor are outfitting 
a group of intrepid heroes to take up the challenge. If 
the adventurers can rescue the weapons from this false 
Keraptis (for who can believe it is really the magician 
of legend, after thirteen hundred years?), the wealthy 
collectors have promised to grant them whatever they 
desire, if it is within their power to do so. 
RUNNING THE ADVENTURE 
This version of White Plume Mountain is designed for 
a group of 8th-level player characters. Your players will 
need both brains and brawn to successfully complete 
their mission, as there are situations here which cannot 
be resolved by frontal assault. If your players are unused 
to hack-proof dilemmas, they may find this adventure 
frustrating or even boring. But if your players are used 
to using their wits, they should find this an intriguing 
balance of problems and action. Unless you are used 
to mastering lengthy adventures, it will probably take 
more than one session for a party to investigate all three 
branches of the dungeon. If this is the case, it would be 
best if the party were required to leave the dungeon and 
reenter upon resumption of the game. If they stay in the 
nearest village (several miles away) they will be rela­
tively safe, but if they camp near White Plume Mountain 
it would be a good idea to roll for random encounters. 
ADVENTURE START 
The party has arrived at White Plume Mountain, which 
stands alone in a vast area of dismal moors and tan­
gled thickets. They will probably arrange to leave their 
horses and possessions either at the nearest village 
(about 5 miles from the mountain) or hidden in the Dead 
Gnoll's Eye Socket, a small natural cave in the side of 
a hill about 2 miles from the Plume. There is really no

96 other shelter available. The villagers know about the 
cave and may have mentioned it. If the party leaves no 
guard, they will just have to trust the villagers not to 
steal their belongings. (Dishonest villagers will have to 
weigh their fear of White Plume Mountain against their 
certain belief that the party will never be seen again.) 
The cave is easily barricaded to keep out unintelligent 
wandering monsters. 
White Plume Mountain is an almost perfectly conical 
volcanic hill formed from an ancient slow lava leakage. 
It is about 1,000 yards in diameter at the base, and rises 
about 800 feet above the surrounding land. The white 
plume that gives the mountain its name and fame is a 
continuous geyser that spouts from the very summit of 
the mountain another 300 feet into the air, trailing off 
to the east under the prevailing winds like a great white 
feather. The spray collects in depressions downslope 
and merges into a sizable stream. Steam vents are vis­
ible in various spots on the slopes of the mountain, but 
none of them are large enough to allow entry. 
Map 4.1 depicts a cross-section of the mountain, 
showing the lava pool and the shaft of the geyser. The 
numbers refer to key areas inside the mountain, show­
ing their orientation with respect to one another. 
The only possible entrance into the cone is a cave 
on the south slope known as the Wizard's Mouth. This 
cave actually seems to breathe, exhaling a large cloud of 
steam and then slowly inhaling, like a person breathing 
on a cold day. Each cycle takes about 30 seconds. Ap­
proaching the cave, the party will hear a whistling noise 
coinciding with the wind cycle. If it were not for the 
continuous roaring of the Plume, this whistling could be 
heard for a great distance. 
The cave is about 8 feet in diameter and 40 feet long. 
At the end of the cave, near the roof, is a long, horizontal 
crevice about a foot wide. The air is sucked into this 
crack at great speed, creating the loud whistling noise 
and snuffing out torches. Shortly the rush of air slows 
down, stops for a couple of seconds, and then comes 
back out in a great blast of steam. This steam is not hot 
enough to scald anyone who keeps low and avoids the 
crevice, but it does make the cave very uncomfortable, 
like a hot sauna bath interrupted by blasts of cold air . 
• 
ABOUT THE 0RICINAL The ceiling and walls of the cave are slick with the 
condensed steam that runs down them. The floor is 
covered with several inches of fine muck. Only careful 
probing of the muck near the back of the cave will reveal 
a mall trapdoor with a rusted iron ring set in it. Once 
the muck has been cleared away, a successful DC 20 
trength check is required to pull up the encrusted door. 
:\lagic such as knock or passwall can also help open or 
bypass the door. 
Directly beneath the door is a 20-foot-square verti­
cal shaft and the beginning of a spiral staircase that 
leads down. 
DUNGEON: GENERAL FEATURES 
All corridors in the dungeon are 10 feet in height, and 
have been carved out of and, in some places, seemingly 
melted through solid rock. Unless otherwise noted, 
doors are 8 feet by 8 feet, made of oak and bound in 
iron. Though the doors are swollen by the dampness, 
and thus difficult to open (requiring a successful DC 15 
Strength check), the wood is not by any means rotten. 
The water on the floor is about 1 foot deep, and the 
floor itself is covered with slippery mud. Except where 
flights of steps lead up out of it, this scummy water cov­
ers the floors of all rooms and corridors. The water and 
mud reduce average movement by one-third (speed 30 
becomes 20, speed 20 becomes 15), and will necessitate 
continuous probing of the floor by the party as they ad­
vance. It will be very difficult to keep silent, run (without 
falling), or depend on invisibility (waves and foot-shaped 
holes in the water give one away). 
RANDOM ENCOUNTERS 
Check once every 10 minutes for random encounters 
by rolling a d12; an encounter occurs on a roll of l. 
If an encounter is indicated, roll a d6 and refer to the 
table below. 
These are monsters that Keraptis has released into 
the dungeon specifically for the purpose of giving the 
intruders a hard time. All will attack immediately. The 
ogres and the bugbears are magically controlled and 
cannot be persuaded to betray Keraptis. 
White Plume Mountain, by Lawrence 
Schick, was originally published in 
1979 as an adventure for the first 
edition of the D&D game. Schick related in the 2013 com­
pilation Dungeons of Dread that he 
wrote the adventure as a way of 
persuading Gary Gygax to hire him 
as a game designer .

LOCATIONS IN THE 
DUNGEON 
-:-he following locations are identified on map 4.2. 
1. SPIRAL STAIRCASE 
-he staircase is badly rusted but appears to be sturdy. 
-he air inside the passageway is warm, humid, and rather 
:oul. You reach the bottom of the stairs with a splash­
:rie floor is submerged beneath a foot of water! 
:he spiral staircase descends about 100 feet before 
»nding in area 1. Sensitive characters will feel it thrum­
-ning to a continuous low vibration (this vibration from 
e Plume geyser will be noticeable everywhere in the 
~ ngeon). In the humidity , lamps and torches will burn 
..;·fully and give off a lot of smoke. 
THE LEGEND OF KERAPTIS 
in the original publication of White Plume Mountain, "The 
Legend of Keraptis" was presented on the inside back 
cover. Although these details of the wizard's former life 
don't play a direct part in the adventure, a DM who shares 
this information with the players can deepen the charac­
ters' understanding of the situation and strengthen their 
motivation for delving beneath the mountain. 
Well over a millennium ago, the wizard Keraptis rose to 
power in the valleys of the northern mountains, bring-
ing the local warlords under his thumb with gruesome 
threats-threats that were fulfilled just often enough to 
keep the leaders in line. Under Keraptis's overlordship , 
the influx of rapacious monsters and raids from the wild 
mountains decreased markedly, dwindled, and then almost 
stopped. Seeing this, the populace did not put up much 
resistance to paying the wizard's heavy taxes and tithes, es­
pecially when stories were circulated of what happened to 
those who balked. Any nobles who protested disappeared 
in the night and were replaced by the next in the line of suc­
cession, who was usually inclined to be more tractable than 
the previous lord. 
Gradually, as dissension was stilled, the taxes and levies 
became even more burdensome , until eventually the wiz­
ard was taking a great piece of everything that was grown, 
made, or sold in the valleys, including the newborn young 
of livestock. Around this time, numerous reports arose in 
the land concerning sudden madness, demonic posses­
sions, and sightings of apparitions and undead. Further­
more, monstrous incursions into the settled lands began to Cutaway View 
(viewed from north) 
MAP 4.,: CUTAWAY VIEW 
increase as raiding parties of humanoids assaulted villages, 
and evil and fantastic monsters appeared from nowhere to 
prey upon the harried peasants. At the height of this unrest, 
Keraptis's tax collectors came forth with word of a new levy: 
one-third of all newborn children were henceforth to be 
turned over to the wizard. 
That edict turned out to be the tipping point. As one, 
the people rose up to overwhelm the wizard's lackeys and 
marched on his keep, where, led by a powerful and good 
cleric and his ranger acolytes, they destroyed Keraptis's fi­
nal guardians. The great wizard barely managed to escape, 
accompanied only by his personal bodyguard company of 
deranged and fanatical evil gnomes. 
Keraptis fled to the cities of the south and west, but wher­
ever he went, his reputation preceded him, and he was un­
able to stay anywhere for long. Once again moving north, 
he came to the shores of the Lake of Unknown Depths, 
where he heard tales about haunted White Plume Moun­
tain. After investigating further, he at last found the refuge 
he was looking for in the tangled maze of volcanic tunnels 
beneath the cone. He and his gnomes vanished into the 
shadow of the Plume, and humankind heard no more of 
the evil wizard. 
That was almost thirteen hundred years before the pres­
ent day. Now, seemingly , the hand of Keraptis is once again 
interfering in human affairs. If it is in truth the ancient 
wizard at work here, can he be thwarted before his power 
grows once more? What is his purpose in presenting this 
bizarre challenge to the world's heroes? There is only one 
way to find out. 
CHAPTER 4 I WHITE PLUME MOUNTAIN 97

98 MAP 4,2: WHITE PLUME MOUNTAIN 
Floating on the water are splotches of green and white 
subterranean algae. This algae or algae-like fungus also 
clings in patches to walls and ceilings. It is harmless, 
and can be found almost everywhere in the dungeon 
where there is water. 
2. RIDDLING GUARDIAN 
A rather mangy, bedraggled gynosphinx squats in the 
space where the three corridors converge. A wall of 
force along the south side separates the gynosphinx 
from those who approach from that direction. This wall 
of force is weaker than most, and can be brought down 
by disintegrate, dispel magic, or passwall . 
The sphinx will let the characters pass (by removing 
the wall of force) if they can answer the following riddle: 
Round she is, yet flat as a board 
Altar of the Lupine Lords 
jewel on black velvet, pearl in the sea 
Unchanged but e'erchanging, eternally 
The answer is "the Moon." If the wall of force is de­
stroyed or circumvented , the sphinx will attack. 
3. HIDDEN SLIME 
Midway along the corridor that runs northeast , the floor 
is covered by a large patch of green slime (see "Dungeon 
CHAPTER 4 I WHITE PLUME MOUNTAIN Hazards" in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). 
Because the slime is covered by water, it is not easily 
detectable, and characters might walk through it and not 
even notice they have done so until it has eaten through 
their boots and started on their feet. 
4. GLASS GLOBES 
The door to this room appears normal on the way in: a 
large iron-bound oak door, swollen by dampness and 
difficult to open. When the characters have entered the 
room (or as many of them as are going in), the door will 
slam shut behind them. No tools, weapons , or magic 
available to the adventurers will open the door or pre­
vent it from closing. Only the proper key inserted in the 
keyhole on the inside of the door will unlock it. 
In the room, suspended from the ceiling by unbreak­
able wires, are nine silvered glass spheres, each about 
2 feet in diameter. Unless otherwise noted, magically 
looking inside a sphere, such as with a clairvoyance 
spell or a ring of x-ray vision, will show that it contains 
some apparent treasure and a key. (Each sphere holds 
a key, but only one of the keys opens the door.) A good, 
hard crack with a weapon will shatter any of the spheres 
(each has AC 13 and 3 hit points), dropping its contents 
(if not caught) into the muck below. 

--- PAGE 100 ---

~umber the globes 1 through 9 for your own refer-
~nce. The globes contain the following items: 
phere 1. Three folded-up shadows, 300 worthless 
lead pieces, and a false key. (The shadows aren't visi­
ble to magical inspection.) 
phere 2. A spell scroll of fear and a false key. 
phere 3.Jewelry worth 12,000 gp, a false key, and an 
angry air elemental. 
phere 4. A potion of flying and a false key. 
phere 5. Eleven worthless glass gems and a false key. 
phere 6. Phony glass jewelry, a false key, and a gray 
ooze. (The ooze fills the entire globe and isn't visible 
o magical inspection.) 
phere 7. A spell scroll of hold person and a false key. 
phere 8. The actual key and a silver ring. When the 
ring is released from the sphere, it speaks to the char­
acters telepathically: 
Stop before you put me on. I confer the following 
:,ewers upon my wearer: invisibility, haste, immunity to 
c'larms,jly once per day, detect magic, and one wish. I 
a so provide the benefits of protection and spell turning. 
-ne only drawback is that once a year I permanently eat a 
small part of your life. I must be worn before I can leave 
;n s room; merely carrying me away is not possible. If 
e,er I am removed from my wearer's finger, however, all 
,.,y powers are lost. So you must decide right now who 
II wear me forever." 
This situation is a basic loyalty and intelligence test. 
Will the party members cut each others' throats over 
he ring? Will they be suspicious enough to simply 
eave it alone? If they take time to think about it, they'll 
likely realize that the ring must be a hoax. 
Someone who puts it on can cause it to exhibit any 
of the powers mentioned above, except for the wish 
pell, as long as it remains in the room. While it is lo­
cated here, the ring enables the wearer to produce the 
indicated spell effects at will (except for fly), and it also 
acts as a ring of spell turning and a ring of protection. 
Once the ring leaves the area, however, it has no 
abilities and can't talk. 
phere 9. Gems worth 600 gp and a false key. 
5. NUMBERED GOLEMS 
;: ve flesh golems are clustered against the north wall. 
Each has a number on its chest: 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13. Num­
:,er 5 says, "One of us does not belong with the others. 
'you can pick it out, it will serve you, and the others will 
a low you passage. If you pick the wrong one, we will kill 
.ou. You have sixty seconds." 
-he correct choice is 9, because it is not a prime 
umber. Give the players an actual 60 seconds to fig­
~e it out. MAP 4.3: GEYSERS AND CHAINS 
If the characters give the wrong answer, roll initiative. 
The golems lumber forward to confront the intruders, 
trying to prevent anyone from moving through the door 
to the north. The monsters will pursue enemies that 
flee to the south, but they won't climb the stairs that led 
to area 6. 
If the characters answer the riddle correctly, events 
unfold as promised: the golem numbered 9 becomes an 
ally of the party, accompanying the characters if they so 
desire, and the other four golems become inert again. 
6. TURNSTILE 
l A short flight of stairs leads up to a dry corridor. Just 
around the corner is a turnstile. 
The characters will discover that the turnstile rotates 
in only one direction (counterclockwise). They can pass 
through it easily when moving to the east, but it will 
probably have to be destroyed on the way back. A golem 
or a strong character could rip it out with a successful 
DC 24 Strength (Athletics) check. l

7.GEYSERS AND CHAINS 
The door opens onto a stone platform in a large natural 
ca e Opposite the entrance in the distance is another 
stoneplatform. Between them, a series of wooden 
disksis suspended from the ceiling by massive steel 
cha ns. The cave floor seems to be covered by a pool of 
001 ing mud. 
The ceiling is 50 feet above the level of the platforms. 
The cave floor is 50 feet below. Two spots in the mud are 
the locations of geysers. The northern one erupts once 
every 5 minutes, the southern one every 3 minutes. The 
stone platform opposite the entrance is approximately 
90 feet away. 
The disks are about 4 feet in diameter and 3 feet 
apart. Each disk is attached to its chain by a giant staple 
fixed in its center. The disks swing freely and will tilt 
when weight is placed upon them. 
The disks and the chains, as well as the walls of the 
cavern, are covered with a wet, slippery algal scum. 
This coating gives off a feeble phosphorescent glow. 
Climbing the chains or the walls requires a successful 
DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. 
When the geysers erupt, they reach nearly to the roof 
of the cavern, and creatures holding onto the disks or 
the chains might be washed off to fall into the boiling 
mud. The damage a creature takes from a geyser de­
pends on how close a creature is to the geyser when it 
erupts (see the table below). Creatures that succeed on a 
DC 15 Dexterity saving throw take half damage. 
In addition, a creature that is on a disk or holding 
onto a chain when a geyser erupts must succeed on 
a Strength saving throw (see the table for DCs) or be 
knocked off and fall into the boiling mud. 
Location Damage DC 
Adjacent to geyser 27 (SdlO) fire damage 14 
One disk away 22 (4dl0) fire damage 13 
Two disks away 16 (3dl0) fire damage 12 
Three disks away 11 (2dl0) fire damage 11 
Four disks away 5 (ldlO) fire damage 10 
Anywhere else in the area 3 (ld6) fire damage 
Any creature that falls into the boiling mud takes 44 
(8d10) fire damage at the start of each of its turns for as 
long as it remains in the mud.

8. COFFIN 
Thedoor opens into an area of utter blackness. 
Theroom beyond the door is the lair of a vampire 
named Ctenmiir. He is compelled by a curse to remain 
hre in a trance except when roused to defend his trea-sure. which lies in a niche in the floor under his coffin. 
Te vampire automatically awakes at the approach of 
•ruders. 
The room is affected by a darkness spell, which the I 
vampire is not hindered by because he has truesight. If 
e vampire needs to leave this area to pursue intruders, 
hedoor to the room is littered with tiny holes through 
hich he can pass in mist form. If the magical darkness 
sdispelled, it renews again automatically at dawn. 
Treasure. The space beneath the coffin contains 
Whelm,a sentient warhammer (see "Sample Sentient 
·ems" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide), 
.000 sp and 9,000 gp in six leather sacks, a potion of 
ind reading, and three spell scrolls (conjure minor ele­
mentals, dispel magic,and magicmouth) . 
. POOL AND DRAIN 
sthe characters move along the water-covered corri­
or,they can see that the water is deeper in a small cir­
ulararea to the east. This space is a 10-foot-deep pit. At 
e bottom is a wheel connected to a valve. Turning the 
eel requires a successful DC 20 Strength check. 
\ \'hen the wheel is turned, a channel will open, and all 
e water in the wet corridors will drain out in 1 hour. 
oat the bottom of the pit is a secret door that is con-
ealed by illusion magic. The door cannot be detected 
_ ight, but can be discovered through the use of magic 
rby someone who examines the area by touch and suc­
eeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. The 
doorway leads to Keraptis's Indoctrination Center (see 
E caping the Dungeon" at the end of the adventure). 
0. DECEPTIVELY DEEP ROOM 
Aheadis what appears to be a water-covered room, with 
s;eps rising out of the muck on the far side. I 
ost of the area is actually a 15-foot-deep pool. The only 
sallow spaces are those that run mostly around the pe­
meter of the room, where the water is only 1 foot deep. 
The deep area that makes up most of the room is 
nhabited by two kelpies (see appendix B). As the char-
cers move into the room, the kelpies will rise to the 
s· rface, and each will attempt to charm a character. 
In the eastern wing of the pool are two partly enclosed 
reaswith entrances that are accessible only from be­
eath the surface of the water. These areas are partially 
overedby a roof along the east edge, where the water 
sonly 1 foot deep. The southern chamber is the kelpies' 
ir. which contains their treasure. The northern cham­
r is empty. Treasure. Scattered about the kelpies' lair are 600 gp, 
a piece of jewelry worth 2,000 gp, and a suit of +l chain 
mail armor. 
11. SPINNING CYLINDER 
The stone corridor changes abruptly to a spinning cylin­
der, apparently made of some light-colored metal. The 
inner surface rotates rapidly. It is painted in a dizzying 
black-and-white spiral pattern, and it glistens as if coated 
with some substance . 
The 30-foot-long cylinder is 10 feet in diameter and 
spins counterclockwise at about 10 feet per second. The 
inner surface is covered with slippery oil. It is possible 
to slide through the cylinder by propelling oneself along 
the floor, but walking through this area without being 
knocked prone requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity 
(Acrobatics) check. 
12. BURKET'S GUARDPOST 
Watching through the arrow slit at the end of the pas­
sage is an alert guard named Burket (LE male human 
veteran). If he sees intruders approaching , he will wait 
until they are halfway through the spinning cylinder and 
then ignite the slippery oil with a flaming arrow. 
CHAPTER 4 I WHITE Plume MOUNTAIN 
101 

--- PAGE 103 ---

102 MAP 4.4: Boiling Lake
The oil burns for 2d4 rounds if the fire is not extin­
guished. On the first round, the burning oil deals 9 (2d8) 
fire damage to any creature that enters the spinning 
cylinder or starts its turn inside the cylinder. On later 
rounds, it deals 2 (ld4) fire damage to such creatures. 
Development. After Burket shoots, he then warns his 
lover, the wizard Snarla, to close and lock the shutter 
over the arrow slit and move to defend the door that 
adjoins the corridor. They stand ready to engage anyone 
that enters. 
Snarla is a werewolf , her Intelligence is 16 (+3), 
and she has the following additional feature, which in­
creases her challenge rating to 5 (1,800 XP): 
Spellcasting. Snarla is a 6th-level spellcaster . Her spellcasting 
ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell at­
tacks). She has the following wizard spells prepared: 
Cantrips (at will):.fire bolt, light, mage hand, shocking grasp 
1st level (4 slots): magic missile, shield, thunderwave 
2nd level (3 slots): mirror image, web 
3rd level (3 slots): dispel magic.fear, haste, stinking cloud 
If Burket is killed or if Snarla finds herself in a bad 
situation , she changes into werewolf form and attacks 
with desperate savagery , giving her advantage on all her 
attack rolls. 
If she is captured alive and made to talk, she will tell 
the party only that she is charged with keeping the kel­
pies and other denizens of the dungeon fed. There are 
CHAPTER 4 I WHITE PLUME MOUNTAIN trange gaps in her memory concerning her employer or 
 anyection of the dungeon other than her own. She has 
neverbeen past the doors at area 14. Burket knows even 
le than she does. 
Treasure. The room has a couple of benches and a 
table. upon which are a large candlestick (worth 10 gp) 
and Snarla's spellbook. The book contains the spells 
that she has prepared and no others. It is protected 
byan explosive runes glyph of warding that deals 5d6 
fire damage. 
13. Snarla's SANCTUM 
Unlike the room you just left, this place is beautifully 
decorated. The floor is covered by fine rugs, the walls by 
erotic tapestries and shimmering curtains, the ceiling 
by an intricate mosaic depicting a summer sky dotted 
with fleecy clouds. In the northeast corner is a large and 
lavishly covered bed, strewn with cushions . Next to it on 
a low table is a buffet of sweetmeats, cakes, and other 
delicious-looking comestibles . In the northwest corner of 
the room is a brass-bound oak chest. 
Anyone who tries out the bed will find that it feels quite 
uncomfortable, and anybody who samples the food will 
be disappointed in the extreme, finding it tough and not 
very tasty. 
In fact, the room is covered in illusions; a true seeing 
spell or similar illusion-piercing magic reveals that the 
opulent bed is only an old straw mattress , and the deli­
cious treats are just ordinary rations. The walls, floor, 
and ceiling of the room are quite bare. A dispel magic 
spell will automatically remove the illusion. 
Treasure. Only the brass-bound chest appears as it 
actually is. The chest must be opened while uttering a 
command word known only to Snarla, or it will emit 
a stinking cloud spell that lasts for 1 minute. Inside 
are 400 ep, 300 gp, and seven gems worth a total 
of 1,300 gp. 
14. FLOOD DOORS 
The three doors along the corridor are made of thick 
metal, their edges flanged so that they overlap the door 
jamb on the north side and thus can be opened only by 
pivoting them to the north. The north side of each door 
has a handle so that it can be pulled open from that 
direction . 
These barriers are emergency doors, whose purpose 
is to prevent the dungeon from being flooded by the boil­
ing lake at area 15, in case of an "accident." 
15. BOILING LAKE 
This boiling lake is several hundred feet deep, extending 
down to the red-hot rock below, and reaching nearly to 
the ceiling of the cavern it occupies , 50 feet above the 
level of the sunken ledge described in area 17. It is fed 
by an underground stream that enters from the north­
west at a depth 100 feet below that of the ledge. Its run-

--- PAGE 104 ---

ff flows through a channel to the east, above the ledge, 
ear the ceiling of the cavern. 
Any creature that enters the boiling lake takes 44 
dlO) fire damage immediately and again at the start of 
each of its turns for as long as it remains in the lake. 
16. BLOW HOLE 
The run-off from the boiling lake cascades down 
;hrough a series of near-vertical lava-tubes to the base 
of the blow hole, 800 feet below the level of the dungeon. 
There the water strikes molten rock and is instantly 
converted to steam. It is ejected up the blow hole and out 
the top of the volcanic cone, forming the continuous gey­
-er of White Plume Mountain. The boiling water here is 
Just as dangerous as the water in area 15. 
17. THE BOILING BUBBLE 
A sunken stone ledge projects out into the boiling lake. 
The corridor from the dungeon continues out into the 
· ake under a magical force field that keeps out the water 
by forming a sort of elastic skin. The shape of the corri­
dor is not square in cross-section, but rather semicircu­
.ar, as if a series of hoops were supporting the ceiling. 
The protective skin is soft, resilient, and uncomfort­
ably warm to the touch. Under any pressure it immedi­
ately becomes taut, and any character unwise enough to 
puncture it with a piercing weapon will cause a stream 
of scalding water to rush into the corridor, hopefully 
burning the idiot who made the hole for 2 ld4) fire damage). Thereafter, any creature that enters the space 
with this stream of scalding water or that starts its turn 
there takes that damage. The skin will not "heal" once 
it is compromised. Major damage to the skin, as from a 
slash with a sword or an axe, will collapse the field like 
a deflating balloon in ld6 rounds. 
After 30 feet the corridor gives way to an oval-shaped, 
domed area enclosed by the protective skin. Here lives 
the guardian of the treasure, a Huge giant crab that has 
the following changes, which increase its challenge rat­
ing to 8 (3,900 XP): 
It has 161 (14d12 + 70) hit points. 
Its Strength and Constitution are 20 (+5). 
• On one of its claws it wears a rune-covered copper 
band that makes it immune to being charmed, fright­
ened, and paralyzed. (The copper band is worthless as 
a treasure, for the magic is keyed to this crab.) 
• It has an improved claw attack: 
Claw. Me/ee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. 
Hit: 27 (4dl0 + 5) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grap­
pled (escape DC 14). The crab has two claws, each of which 
can grapple only one target. 
The crab will intelligently attack intruders, being care­
ful not to bump the protective skin walls. The crab is 
experienced in fighting in this manner, as is evidenced 
by the bones scattered about, but the characters are 
not. You will have to watch for characters whose actions 
might rip the water skin, especially any foolish enough 
to use two-handed weapons or a violent spell such as 
fireball or lightning bolt. Such people are likely to get the 
whole party boiled. 
Treasure. At the north end of the domed area is a 
heavy chest firmly attached to the floor. In it is Wave, a 
sentient trident (see "Sample Sentient Items" in chapter 
7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide), 1,000 gp in small 
sacks, twenty gems (two big ones worth 1,000 gp each, 
one big one worth 5,000 gp, and seventeen others worth 
a total of 3,935 gp), goggles of night, and a stone of 
good luck. 
Development. A character who grabs Wave while the 
protective skin is collapsing can save the lives of those 
nearby by using the trident as a cube of force. Wave will 
instantly make its bearer aware of this property and 
allow the bearer to instantly become attuned to it if that 
person worships a god of the sea or is willing to convert 
on the spot. 
Characters protected by the cube will probably end up 
being blown out the geyser at the top of the mountain. 
The air-filled cube will float, drain down the cascade, 
and be ejected from the Plume-a rocky ride. 
Characters could also survive the boiling lake with a 
combination of immunity to fire damage and the ability 
to breathe water. 
18. HALL PIT 
Halfway down the corridor that leads to the northwest 
is a 10-foot-long , 10-foot-deep open pit, filled with and 
hidden by water. If the characters aren't testing the 
floor ahead of them, those in the first rank must suc­
ceed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw to avoid falling 
into the pit. 
CHAPTER 4 I WHITE PLUME MOUNTAIN 

--- PAGE 105 ---

19. METAL-HEATING CORRIDOR 
I A series of copper-colored metal plates lines the walls of 
the path before you. I 
The plates are 6 feet high and 6 feet wide, and cannot 
be damaged or removed. They produce an invisible elec­
trical field that extends from floor to ceiling throughout 
the 70-foot-long corridor. The field isn't directly harmful, 
but metal objects that pass between the plates become 
heated. Metal will become uncomfortably warm after 
moving 20 feet into the field, painfully hot after 30 feet, 
and hot enough to deal fire damage at 40 feet and be­
yond. The field affects armor, weapons, equipment, and 
even treasure made of metal. 
A character in metal armor who tries to move through 
this corridor would take damage as follows: 4 (ld8) fire 
damage at 40 feet, another 9 (2d8) fire damage at 50 
feet, an additional 16 (3d10) fire damage at 60 feet, and 
another 22 (4d10) fire damage at 70 feet. 
Characters not wearing metal armor but carrying 
metal weapons or equipment will feel only slight 
discomfort when passing between the plates. Metal 
carried in wrappings of cloth will burn through by the 
SO-foot mark, and it will similarly burn through leather 
by the 60-foot mark. Armored characters might have 
no recourse other than to remove their armor, then 
drag, push, or use magic to get their metal armor and 
weapons through the corridor, and then suit up again. 
Armor pulled through the corridor by ropes will heat up 
enough to burn through the ropes at 60 feet, leaving a 
pile of hot metal lying in the water. 
The only sovereign remedies for this dilemma are 
area effects that deal cold damage, such as ice storm or 
cone of cold, which will nullify the effect long enough for 
the party to dash through. 
20. GHOUL AMBUSHERS 
Behind the secret door, eight ghouls wait in ambush for 
intruders to come through the heat-induction corridor. 
These ghouls wear amulets that make them immune to 
the Turn Undead ability. 
21. STAIRS UP 
These stairs lead up out of the water to the dry corri­
dor beyond. 
22. FRICTIONLESS TRAP 
When the characters pass through the door from area 
21, describe the features of the room beyond depending 
on how much of the chamber they can see. 
CHAPTER 4 I WHITE PLUME MOUNTAIN • 
T e path to the west is broken by a sizable gap, and you 
can see the glint of metal at the bottom of the opening. 
The floor beyond this area has a silvery sheen. 
In the distance you can see another hole, beyond 
which is a patch of floor that adjoins the western wall. 
The openings in the floor are pits, each 5 feet wide 
and 10 feet deep. Their bottoms are lined with rusty, 
razor-like blades. Anyone who falls in takes 6 (ld12) 
damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution 
saving throw or contract a disease called super-tetanus 
(see below). 
The walls, ceiling, and floor of the area between the 
pits are covered with a substance that is totally friction­
less. This silvery stuff is inert and utterly unaffected by 
any force, magical or otherwise. Anything that alights 
on the surface will move in the direction of its last hori­
zontai impetus, bouncing off the walls (if it strikes them) 
like a billiard ball, until it slides into a razor-pit. It is im­
possible for a creature even to stand still on the surface, 
for the slightest movement in any direction would unbal­
ance it enough to send it moving in that direction. 
Magic that augments movement (such as fly.jump, 
and levitate) and teleportation effects do not work in 
this room. 
The line near the west edge of the room is the illusion 
of a wall-the actual wall is 10 feet farther away. Ob­
jects that make contact with the illusory wall will pass 
through it and seemingly disappear. This fact tends to 
frustrate (at least initially) any scheme for attaching a 
rope to the west wall from afar. 
In fact, however, one way to get safely across is to get 
a rope strung through the room and fastened securely 
at both ends. Once this is done, characters can pull 
themselves across the floor and are able to control their 
speed. A clever party might be able to come up with 
other methods. Ingenuity is required. 
Super-Tetanus. A creature that contracts the disease 
of super-tetanus is wracked with pain as its heart races 
and its muscles spasm hard enough to break its bones. 
The creature takes 11 (2d10) damage at the start of each 
of its turns. If a victim is not cured by other means, it 
can repeat the saving throw at the end of every minute 
after becoming exposed, ending the effect on itself with 
a successful save. 
23. FLOATING STREAM 
Water not only flows through this room, it floats. 
Entering a hole in the western wall, two feet off the 
floor, is a stream seemingly suspended in mid-air. It 
flows out of another hole near the northeast corner. The 
water is about three feet deep. You can see a few blind 
cave fish being carried along in the brisk current. 

--- PAGE 106 ---

On either side of the door are a total of s 
each able to carry two riders, but there are o :::a:::.:: es o 
be found. 
• • 
The stream is hemispherical in cross-section where it 
ows through the room. The entrance and exit hole are 
6 feet in diameter; they are the ends of a tunnel that con­
nects this room with area 24. 
The water is lukewarm. Objects can be thrust through 
tlle sides of the stream, but no water other than a few 
·rops will escape. It would even be possible to walk 
right through the stream, but only a very strong creature 
-ould do so without being swept off its feet (requiring a 
DC 15 Strength saving throw). The stream flows quite 
uickly from west to east. 
If characters choose to go boating into the unknown 
-unnel, they will have to figure out how to get in the 
kayaks once the kayaks are placed in the stream, the 
surface of which is 5 feet off the floor. These vessels 
p over easily. If they successfully board the kayaks, 
;he characters will bump along through a twisting 
:unnel 6 feet across. They can regulate their speed by 
pushing against the walls. Eventually they will emerge 
mo area 24. 
24. SIR BLuTo's GuARDPOST 
fallen knight named Sir Bluto Sans Pite (a NE cham­
pion; see appendix B) and his eight minions (NE human 
knights) wait here to ambush any who come through 
tlle tunnel. They will be alerted by disturbances in the 
-ow of water as the party tampers with it upstream. The 
-cream that flows through this room is suspended in 
;he same manner as in area 23. It continues from north 
-o south out of area 24 and back to area 23, completing 
tlle circuit. 
Sir Bluto's knights work in two teams of four, with 
rwo team members on each side of the stream. When 
a kayak comes out, a team will throw a large net over 
_ and attempt to drag it and its occupants out of the 
:tream and down onto the floor. When it falls, they move 
in to finish off the occupants with swords. To escape 
·rom a net, a creature can use its action to make a DC 
0 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature 
. ·ithin its reach on a successful check. Dealing 5 slash­
illg damage to the net (AC 10) also frees a creature with­
out harming it; any other creature in the same net can 
then use its action to free itself through that opening. 
Sir Bluto was a respected Knight of the Realm before 
· is indictment in the River of Blood mass-murder case. 
His mysterious disappearance from prison left even 
tlle Royal Magician-Detectives baffled, and a reward of 
0,000 gp was posted for his capture. Someone in the 
party is sure to recognize his one-of-a-kind face. 
Treasure. In addition to his weapons and armor, 
ir Bluto wears boots of striding and springing. In ad­
dition, he carries the key that opens the secret doors 
at area 25. M/\P 4.5: AQ.U/\RIUM /\ND PRISON 
25. MAGICAL SECRET DOORS 
The secret doors at either end of the narrow corridor 
will reveal themselves and open only to the bearer of Sir 
Bluto's magic key. 
You are looking out and down into an enormous cham­
ber defined by terraced steps that ring the entire area and 
descend toward a central enclosure . 
A few feet south of the door, water laps at the edge of 
the stone floor. Looking to the side, you can see that the 
ring of the terrace that lies beyond is a ten-foot-deep ring 
of water held in by a nearly transparent wall. Another of 
these watery steps in the terrace is somewhat lower than 
the first; at the level in between these aquariums, the 
terrace steps are dry, but the area is still enclosed by a 
glassy wall like the others. 
CHAPTER 4 I WHITE PLUME MOUNTAIN 
I05 

--- PAGE 107 ---

106 Each tier in the room is 10 feet in depth and width. The 
three middle levels are enclosed by 10-foot-tall glass 
walls that keep the inhabitants of those tiers confined. 
The two on either side are filled with water. All the crea­
tures in this room have been charmed and ordered to 
stay in their areas as long as their glass walls are intact. 
A IO-foot-square area of glass wall has AC 15, and 20 
hit points. The glass can also be broken with a success­
ful DC 15 Strength check. 
The only exit from the room is the door that leads 
south out of the bottom tier. It opens into a corridor that 
passes under the higher tiers of the room. 
Breaking Glass. If any of the glass walls are broken, 
a weak wall of force will activate immediately in front 
of the door on the bottom tier (preventing water from 
forcing the door open and escaping into the corridor 
beyond). If the glass is broken on both of the aquariums , 
the volume of water is sufficient to fill the two lower tiers 
and cover the floor of the middle tier to a depth of about 
2 feet. The water will slowly drain out of four small 
drains in the corners of the bottom tier, but it will take 
a good three hours to do so. Of course, characters who 
CHAPTER 4 I WHITE PLUME MOUNTAIN choose to wait will be subject to the possibility of ran­
dom encounters. Once the water is finally gone, the wall 
of force will disappear. 
If the characters destroy the wall of force, the pres­
sure of the water will push open the door and the water 
will rush into the corridor beyond, pulling along any 
swimming characters and miscellaneous debris nearby. 
The water will collide with another wall of force that 
covers the door to area 27, and then begin draining out 
through a grating in the floor in the last 10 feet of the 
passage. The water will take only 20 minutes to drain 
out through this grating. (The water drains straight 
down through an old lava tube to a large cave with no 
other exits.) When the water is gone, the wall of force 
barring entry to area 27 dissipates. 
Creatures. The occupants of each level will be ran­
domly distributed when the party enters, but as the in­
truders come near, the monsters will move to follow, ex­
pecting to be fed. They are accustomed to live food, and 
will ignore dead meat or other nonliving sustenance. 
They consider any living creature that enters their do­
main as food, and will attempt to eat it.

"re their spikes at any they recognize as intruders. 
Treasure. A safe is set in the north wall opposite the 
oor on the bottom tier. If it is opened incorrectly that 
s. the trap not removed), a vibration device in the wall is 
·ggered that will shatter the glass walls in this area in 
d6 rounds. The safe contains 6,000 sp and one piece of 
·velry worth 3,000 gp. 
27. LUXURIOUS PRISON 
~avish furnishings and decorations are everywhere in this 
arge room. The floor is strewn with rugs and cushions, 
and tapestries cover the walls. A hookah as tall as an 
adult human stands in one corner. The largest piece of 
'urniture is a sumptuous divan. 
-he room is the residence of Qesnef, an oni who lost a 
:>et with Keraptis and as a result must confine himself 
:1 these luxurious surroundings, guarding his treasure, 
·or 1,001 years. A magic mouth spell warns him of the 
approach of trespassers, so he will disguise himself 
y using his Change Shape ability to take the form of a 
oughty halfling warrior, claiming to be someone who 
as been trapped by the evil wizard. 
Treasure. Qesnef's valuables have been casually 
shoved beneath the divan. The hoard includes Blackra­
zor. a sentient greatsword (see "Sample Sentient Items" 
m chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide), 1,000 ep, 
_QQ pp, four pieces of jewelry worth a total of 11,000 gp, 
a potion of greater healing, a scroll of protection (fiends), 
and armor of vulnerability (slashing). 
In addition, Qesnef wears a ring of protection on his 
eft hand and a ring of spell storing (with two mirror im­
age spells in it) on his right. 
ESCAPING THE DUNGEON 
_·the characters obtain two or even all three of the 
;nagic weapons and are finally leaving for good, they 
might be stopped at area 2 by the return of the wall of 
orce. A voice will speak to them out of the air: 
"Not thinking of leaving, are you? You've been so very 
entertaining. I just couldn't think of letting you go, es· 
pecially with those little items of mine. And since you've 
eliminated all of their guardians, why, you'll simply have 
to stay ... to take their places. I'll have to ask you to leave all of your ridiculous weapons behind and let Nix 
and Nox escort you to the Indoctrination Center. I'll be 
most disappointed if you cause me any trouble and Nix 
and Nox have to eliminate you. Don't worry-you'll like 
it here." 
Creatures. The wall of force disappears, but coming 
up the south passage are Nix and Nox, two efreet. If the 
party can get past them, they're home free. 
Of course, this whole episode can be omitted if the 
party has already taken too much damage. Conversely , 
if the characters have had too easy a time of it, this final 
challenge can be made tougher by the addition of one or 
two more efreet (called Box and Cox). 
If, for some foolish reason, the party decides to comply 
with Keraptis's request and go with Nix and Nox to the 
Indoctrination Center, you will have to play it by ear. It's 
not too difficult-use your imagination and make it up as 
you go. Just make sure that the characters are extremely 
sorry they ever decided to submit to Keraptis's demands. 
They probably will end up as the brainwashed new 
guards in Keraptis's renewed version of White Plume 
Mountain 's dungeon. W

DEAD IN THAY 
EAR THE VILLAGE OF DAGGERF ORD o:,.; 
the Sword Coast, the Red Wizards of 
Thay plotted to extend the evil reach of 
their land and its master, the lich lord 
Szass Tam. At a site called Bloodgate 
Keep they built a powerful portal. 
fueled by elemental nodes, that could 
allow Thayans to instantly transport 
hole armies into the very heart of the Sword Coast. 
-"ith this power, the Red Wizards would surely over­
. row and take control of the North. 
However, groups of heroes recently assaulted Blood­
=ate Keep and its master, the lich Tarul Var. With the 
~e1p of a renegade Red Wizard named Mennek Ariz, this 
ault was successful. Bloodgate Keep fell, and Szass 
Tam's plans of invasion were crushed. 
What no one expected, though, was that despite the 
.. all of the keep itself, parts of the Bloodgate Nexus (an 
nrerconnected series of teleportation circles) survived, 
nd a Thayan Resurrection cell leader named Syranna 
e\'ised a way to use it against Szass Tam. Syranna 
ad been part of the team that originally assembled the 
3loodgate Nexus, and knew that remaining nodes al­
_owed direct access to a secret Thayan training ground 
-:nown as the Doomvault. 
This adventure takes place in the Doomvault. It is de­
s.gned for 9th-level characters. By the end of the story, 
ey are likely to advance to 11th level or perhaps higher 
_ if they don't end up dead in Thay. 
SYNOPSIS 
·· azit Gui, a Thayan archmage, built the Doomvault to 
·iphon the souls of those who perished within it for use 
.n his dark experiments. One of these was the creation 
of an extradimensional vault in which he stored his 
phylactery. Eventually, Szass Tam and his followers de­
'eated and enslaved Gui. They changed the Doomvault 
.mo a monstrous menagerie and arcane laboratory. 
_.\.!though the space is still called the Phylactery Vault 
f Ka zit Gui, it now also holds the phylacteries of Szass 
-:'am and all his elite lich servants. 
Syranna knows that if the characters can make their 
•. ·ay through the Doomvault and find the entrance to the 
phylactery vault, they could strike a deathblow to Szass 
Tam's hold on power. She can provide them access and 
a little bit of guidance, but the bulk of the work is in their 
hands. They must assault the Doomvault quickly-the 
more word gets out about their activities , the more the 
site's guards will be on alert. 
Eventually, the characters will discover that Szass 
:-am is siphoning the power of members of the Chosen, 
mortals who have been invested with the power of the 
gods so as to help shape the Realms to match the will of 
their divine benefactors. The lich is using that pm.•.:er to keep the vault hidden, warp the magic fueling the Doom­
vault, and power his pursuit of godhood. 
CHARACTERS' GOALS 
Over the course of the adventure , the characters try to 
accomplish the following tasks: 
Explore the Doomvault and deal as much damage to 
the Thayans as possible. 
Learn how to access the Phylactery Vault, and destroy 
the phylacteries within it. 
The villains' goals are straightforward: defend the 
Doomvault and kill the intruders. Not all of the charac­
ters' potential foes share these goals, so the opportunity 
exists to turn enemies into allies, or at least useful tools. 
THE DOOMVAULT 
After the fall of Bloodgate Keep, a Red Wizard named 
Syranna , a leader in the Thayan Resurrection resis­
tance movement, saw an unusual opportunity. Her 
knowledge of the secret portal network of which the 
Bloodgate was a part gave her the ability to open portals 
directly into the Doomvault. 
PLACING THE ADVENTURE 
This adventure takes place in the Forgotten Realms, but it 
can easily be transplanted-the site and the story alike­
into another setting. 
Dragon/ance. On Krynn, the Doomvault is likely to be the 
work of renegade wizards, perhaps of more than one color, 
with magic as their only alliance and moral compass. The 
dungeon might exist underneath a ruined Tower of High 
Sorcery, or it could be a haunt of Fistandantilus before his 
failed attempt at godhood. If it is part of ruins, it could 
even be the Tower of I star, which Nuitari took at the end of 
the Chaos War. Or it might be the same tower, after Mina 
raised it and the black-robed wizards took it for their own. 
Eberron. The Doomvault, lying beneath the Mournland, 
might be the secret project of King Kaius of Karrnath. 
Kaius I hid in the dungeon from the time the lich Vol made 
him a vampire until he returned to take the throne from 
his grandson . He's trying to become powerful enough 
to thwart Vol's influence on him and become the preem­
inent monarch of Khorvaire. Kai us is draining powerful 
dragonmarked scions instead of Chosen. Alternatively, the 
Doomvault could be the Blood of Vol's headquarters in 
Khorvaire. Vol uses the dungeon to harvest the power of 
dragon marks so she can become an undead god. 
Greyhawk. Perhaps Rary the Traitor found the Doom­
vault-yet another vestige of ancient Sulm-under the 
Bright Desert. Rary takes any chance to increase his power, 
even as he claims the desire to destroy the accursed Scor­
pion Crown and return Sulm to its fertile state. Since his 
betrayal of the Circle of Eight and the subjugation of the 
people of the Bright Desert, Rary has made countless en­
emies who want him to fail even at noble aims. If he suc­
ceeds at destroying the crown, his tyranny will still remain.

IIO The following sections contain details on the logistics 
of running an adventure set there. When you're familiar 
with these, continue with the characters' introduction to 
Syranna and their mission in Into The Doomvault. 
DUNGEON CHARACTERISTICS 
Locations in the Doomvault are identified on map 5.1. 
The following characteristics are common to all the ar­
eas, unless otherwise noted in a specific description. 
Because of Szass Tam's suspicious nature, and the 
existential threat that discovery of the Phylactery Vault 
would pose, movement within the Doomvault is regu­
lated with what one might call excessive precautions. 
SECTORS, ZONES, AND AREAS 
The Doomvault is divided into nine sectors that each fo­
cus on a different theme. A sector is split into four zones, 
that each explore one facet of that theme with a number 
of areas detailing a particular example. Magic gates sep­
arate zones from one another. 
Sectors are labeled on the map: Abyssal Prisons, 
Blood Pens, Masters' Domain, Far Realm Cysts, For­
ests of Slaughter , Ooze Grottos, Predator Pools, Golem 
Laboratories , and Temples of Extraction . Zones are also 
labeled on the map. Areas are identified by numbers. 
DIMENSIONAL BARRIERS 
Magic secures the dungeon . No spell or trait allows 
anyone to evade the dungeon's security. For instance , 
a wizard might use a dimension door spell to teleport 
from one part of a zone to another, but no spell permits 
teleportation out of the zone in which the spell was cast. 
Similarly , a wizard might cast a passwall spell to bur­
row from one area to another. If the tunnel would pass 
from one zone to another, circumventing security, then 
the tunnel ends halfway between the origin point and 
the possible exit point. In any case, the caster knows 
why the spell didn't work as intended. Further, an incor­
poreal or ethereal creature can't pass between zones. 
A detect magic spell can't penetrate the structure of 
the Doomvault to sense the dimensional barriers. 
MAGIC GATES 
Two types of magic gates, white and black, secure the 
Doomvault. Magic keys allow the manipulation of them. 
ABOUT THE 0RICINAL Gate Features. Each gate is a 10-foot-wide circle of 
runes, drawn on the floor. This circle creates a magical 
energy field in its space from floor to ceiling. Someone 
who touches the edge of a gate's field can assess its 
nature with a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) 
check. The field can be disabled by the use of a glyph 
key , see below). 
A creature that enters an active gate's energy field 
while not holding a properly attuned glyph key is pushed 
back 10 feet. The first time a creature does so on a turn, 
the creature takes 5 (2d4) force damage. 
White Gates. White gates are placed in the dungeon 
to block passage between zones. When the characters 
see a white gate for the first time, read: 
A ten-foot·diameter circle of runes and clear quartz frag­
ments is set into the floor. Within the circle, a luminous 
white mist shimmers, obscuring what lies beyond. 
Thereafter, you can shorten the description of the gates 
they encounter to avoid repetition. 
A white gate's misty energy field, when active, gives 
off dim light and renders its area heavily obscured. This 
field is also an impenetrable magical force that blocks 
passage (material and ethereal), sound, and scent. 
If a glyph key attuned to the zone on either side of the 
gate is applied to the gate's field, the mist dissipates and 
the energy field becomes inactive while the key remains 
within the gate. Therefore, a creature that has a properly 
attuned glyph key can hold a white gate open for others. 
Black Gates. The black gates were part of the Doom­
vault's original construction . They connect different 
areas of the complex. When the characters see a black 
gate for the first time, read: 
A ten-foot-diameter circle of runes and black onyx frag­
ments is set into the floor. It exudes wisps of shadowy 
energy that look like curling black smoke. 
Thereafter , you can shorten the description of the gates 
they encounter to avoid repetition . 
Dead in Thay, by Scott Fitzgerald 
Gray, was originally produced in 
2014 as an adventure for the D&D 
Encounters organized play pro­
gram. At that time, it also served as 
a playtest for the rules that eventu­
ally became the fifth edition of the game. This version of the adventure 
has been modified for home play. 
• 
CHAPTER 5 I DEAD IN THAY Featuring an immense and le­
thal dungeon, the adventure is a 
tribute to Tomb of Horrors, Ruins 
of Undermountain , and other killer 
dungeons from the game's history . 

--- PAGE 112 ---

CHAPTER 5 I DEAD IN THAY 
111 

--- PAGE 113 ---

112 When a black gate's magical field is active, it gives off 
shadowy energy that lightly obscures the field's area. 
A creature can render a black gate's field inactive by 
holding any glyph key to the field, whereupon the smoky 
energy dissipates . If the key is attuned to a zone con­
taining a different black gate, then the creature holding 
the key can also open a magical portal that leads to the 
other black gate's area. While the portal is open, the des­
tination gate's field also becomes inactive. A black gate's 
field remains inactive until no glyph key is applied to it. 
A portal created within a black gate remains open until 
the creature that opened the portal leaves the area of 
either connected black gate. 
As the adventure progresses , the characters learn that 
disrupting a number of black gates is essential to reach­
ing the Phylactery Vault, where the party can upset 
Szass Tam's plans and loosen his grip on power in Thay. 
Szass Tam's channeling of Chosen life force has created 
instability in the black gates' magic. To reach the Phylac­
tery Vault, six black gates must be disrupted. Once those 
gates are disrupted, any black gate can be forced to con­
nect the Temples of Extraction to the Phylactery Vault, 
which is otherwise accessible only to Szass Tam. 
Once the characters learn that they need to disrupt the 
gates, anyone who understands the nature of the gates 
knows how to perform the disruption. As an action, a 
character who has the glyph key attuned to a black gate's 
zone can disrupt the gate. To do so, the character must 
touch the edge of the gate's energy field and succeed 
on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check. A dispel magic 
spell cast on the gate up to 1 minute beforehand grants 
advantage on this check. On a failure, the character per­
forming the check takes 7 (2d6) force damage. 
Creatures patrolling the Doomvault don't notice the 
disruption , since a disrupted black gate continues to 
function normally. However , the gate's active field deals 
10 (3d6) force damage (instead of 2d6). 
Gatehou se. Thanks to Syranna , the Red Wizard reb­
els maintain control of an unmapped magic gatehouse , 
which is how the characters first arrive in Thay and 
enter the Doomvault. The gatehouse contains several 
permanent teleportation circles. Syranna can key these 
circles to any entry point (listed below). Further, any 
creature that possesses a glyph key can use a black gate 
to teleport from the Doomvault to a permanent telepor­
tation circle in the gatehouse. 
The gatehouse also has a huge physical gate, facing 
east into Thay just west of Lake Thaylambar. This gate 
is built into a cliff about 30 miles northwest of Eltabbar 
and about 30 miles south of Keluthar. Syranna usually 
keeps this gate sealed, opening it only for emergencies. 
She raises this gate to allow characters out of the gate­
house and into Thay only if you decide she does so. 
Entry Points. Choose a starting location for the party 
from among the seven entry points in the Doomvault. 
Black gates in the following areas have entry points 
labeled on the map: area 1 (Abyssal Prisons), area 23 
(Blood Pens), area 33 (Masters' Domain), area 38 (Far 
Realm Cysts), area 49 (Forests of Slaughter) , area 61 
(Ooze Grottos), and area 77 (Predator Pools). 
Glyph Keys. A magic crystal pendant on a bronze 
chain, a glyph key allows creatures to manipulate a 
CHAPTER 5 I DEAD IN THAY handful of specific magic gates within the Doomvault. A 
glyph key is attuned to a zone or zones, allowing manip­
ulation of gates within the attuned areas. For example, 
a glyph key attuned to the Temple of Chaos (areas 4 
through 7) allows its user to use a functional black gate 
to open a portal to the black gate in area 7, as well as to 
pass through the white gates between area 4 and area 2, 
between area 6 and area 8 or area 16, and between area 
7 and area 12. 
Touching a glyph key provides a telepathic sense of 
the name of its attuned zone or zones. Thus, when the 
characte rs find glyph keys, they know which zones the 
keys are for. 
A glyph key can hold multiple attunements , and at­
tunements can be passed from one key to another. Only 
one attunement can be passed at a time. To pass an 
attunement, one creature must hold the originating key 
and another creature must hold the target key. The keys 
must touch. Then, as an action, the creature holding 
the originating key must make a DC 15 Intelligence (Ar­
cana) check. If the check succeeds , each key shares the 
chosen attunement. If the check fails, the attunement 
remains in the originating key and each key's holder 
takes 2 (ld4) force damage. Also, if the check fails by 5 
or more, the originating key is destroyed. 
Temples of Extraction Glyph Keys. The Temples of 
Extraction are the site of Szass Tam's dark experiments 
with the Chosen of the gods, and security there is tighter 
than anywhere else in the Doomvault. Only four glyph 
keys to this sector, one for each zone, are outside the 
Temples of Extraction sector. They are in area 10, area 
25, area 31, and area 63. The characters need to find 
these glyph keys to gain access to the temples. 
COMMON FEATURES 
This section details further generalities about the 
Doomvault. Descriptions in specific areas take prece­
dence over this overview. 
Atmosphere. Abjuration magic keeps the dungeon 
dry and at a comfortab le temperature. A detect magic 
spell reveals this magic as a faint aura on all the Doom­
vault's surfaces. 
Construction. Regular rooms and their features are 
of worked and finished stone, mostly marble. Caverns 
are rough-hewn stone. 
Ceilings rise from 20 feet to vaults of 30 feet. Caverns 
have natural ceilings roughly 30 feet high. Corridor ceil­
ings are 20 feet high. 
Contact Stones. Each zone contains a circle of mag­
ical glyphs displayed on a wall or an object. These lo­
cations serve as contact stones, allowing someone who 
has a glyph key to contact the gatehouse. The characters 
can use any contact stone to contact Syranna and have 
her attune glyph keys to the zone where the contact 
stone is located. 
When the characters see a contact stone on a wall for 
the first time, use the following description. 
l Glowing glyphs form a circle on the wall about three feet ] 
off the floor. 

--- PAGE 114 ---

Thereafter, you can shorten the description o · e con­
tact stones they encounter to avoid repeti ion. 
Normal Doors. The Doomvault' s door are ,uod rein­
forced with steel, and they open easily. Mo t door lack 
latches, bars, or locks. Those that are locked require a 
·uccessful DC 15 Dexterity check to pick or a ucce sful 
DC 20 Strength check to force open. 
Secret Doors. A successful DC 20 Wisdom (Percep­
tion) check is required to find a typical secret door. 
False Doors. A character must succeed on a DC 20 
Intelligence (Investigation) check to determine that a 
door is real or false without opening it. 
Light. Insubstantial magic orbs provide bright light 
in areas that indicate no other illumination conditions. 
Boxed text meant to be communicated to the players as­
·umes that someone can see the described area. 
Pit Traps. A typical pit trap is under a 5-foot-square 
section of floor, which forms a lid hinged on the inner 
side and lined with lead. A character within 5 feet of 
he lid might notice it with a successful DC 20 passive 
Perception check. A character who searches the area 
notices the lid with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Per­
-eption) check. A lid can be jammed so that it remains 
dosed by a character who makes a successful DC 15 
Dexterity check. Otherwise, the lid falls open when a 
mall or larger creature places weight on it. 
A creature that triggers the lid must succeed on a DC 
15 Dexterity saving throw or fall 20 feet onto a bed of 
·tone spikes, taking 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage and 13 
2dl2) piercing damage. The pit walls are smooth stone. 
The lid closes magically 5 minutes after being triggered. 
The lead on the lid prevents the magic of a closed trap 
from being detected. 
DUNGEON DENIZENS 
The Red Wizards, aided and abetted by their Thayan 
servants, hold sway over the Doomvault. In addition to 
battling the monstrous residents of the dungeon, the 
characters will need to contend with these humanoids. 
Thayans as Foes. Thayan humanoids in the dungeon, 
especially Red Wizards, prefer to survive encounters 
""·ith the characters. (All Thayans in the dungeon are 
non-good in alignment, and most of them are lawful.) 
·\'hen hard pressed, a few might be convinced to surren­
der, by the use of Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) 
checks. Under interrogation, however, most of these 
•.·illains lie or otherwise mislead the characters, aiming 
:o kill them with misinformation. Thayans who escape 
me characters' assault and have no other purpose either 
eave the Doomvault through the gatehouse or join pa­
trols that attempt to hunt down the characters . 
Prisoners. Most humanoid prisoners are terrified and 
have only enough strength to avoid battle. Prisoners do 
hard labor or end up as food for the dungeon 's monsters. 
They have no glyph keys and can't leave their zone with­
out help. If able, freed prisoners beg for aid in escaping. 
If given glyph keys, they head to the gatehouse. Use the 
commoner for prisoners if needed. 
REDUCED-THREAT MONSTERS 
A reduced-threat monster uses a normal monster·s sta­
jstics, but it has half the normal hit point maximum and takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, ability checks, saving 
throws, and saving throw DCs. 
A reduced threat creature that is based on a creature 
bigger than Large is instead Large. Some specific re­
duced-threat creatures also make changes to the abil­
ities they can use. A reduced-threat creature is worth 
half the normal XP earned for defeating it. 
DUNGEON STATE 
This adventure describes each area as it exists when the 
characters first arrive in the Doomvault. As they explore, 
they change the dungeon's state. Record the state each 
area is in when the characters leave. You need to track 
which rooms have been explored, which monsters have 
been defeated, which secrets remain undiscovered, what 
treasure has been taken, and so on. If the characters 
return to an area, your notes can remind you what is dif­
ferent from the original text. 
RESTING 
The incursion into the Doomvault is intended to be a 
fast-paced assault in which the characters have little 
time for typical rests. A few areas of the dungeon offer 
access to special magic that allows characters to gain 
the benefit of a rest. 
The adventure assumes the characters stay in or close 
to the dungeon for the duration of their exploration. If 
you want the characters to be able to leave and return 
to the Doomvault, Syranna can use the circles in the 
gatehouse to send the party just about anywhere (except 
the Temples of Extraction or the Phylactery Vault). She 
can also allow the characters to return by giving them 
spell scrolls of teleportation circle keyed to the circles 
in the gatehouse. If you allow the characters to leave the 
Doomvault through the gatehouse , the characters can 
take normal rests outside the dungeon. Doing so has an 
effect on the alert level. 
Resting within the Doomvault is risky, because of ran­
dom encounters and the rising alert level (see below). 
ALERT LEVEL 
The Doomvault is an active complex. As effects of the 
characters ' assault grow more widespread or easily 
detected, the alert level of the dungeon's inhabitants 
rises. This level starts at O and can go no lower than 0. It 
increases by 1 every 4 hours the characters spend inside 
the dungeon, including resting. The alert level affects 
the frequency and difficulty of random encounters . 
For each 24 hours the characters spend outside the 
dungeon, the alert level decreases by 1. During this 
time, the Doomvault returns to a state more stable than 
when the characters left. Monsters might be recaptured 
or replaced, and new challenges could be set up to foil 
incursions. Alter the dungeon's contents as you see fit to 
account for the returning party's previous actions and 
the reactions of their foes. 
A few other events specified in the adventure can raise 
or lower the alert level. 
DREAD WARRIORS 
Szass Tam devised the ritual that enables the creation 
of dread warriors (described in appendix B). The lich 
CHAPTER 5 DEAD IN THAY l13 

--- PAGE 115 ---

ll4 has since altered the process to make it possible for 
a Red Wizard to take control of a dread warrior. The 
effect creates a psychic link between the dread warrior 
and a Red Wizard, who can, for a time, experience the 
world through the dread warrior's senses, speak with 
its mouth, and cast spells through it. A powerful wizard 
can control more than one dread warrior at a time. 
When a party in the Doomvault encounters a dread 
warrior that isn't in the company of a Red Wizard or 
Tarul Var, a special interaction may occur. If the dread 
warrior survives until end of the third round (or for 
more than 20 seconds), Tarul Var (see area 10) becomes 
aware of the group's presence. Var's attention raises 
the overall alert level by 1. In addition, Tarul Var takes 
control of the dread warrior by the start of its next turn. 
Instead of allowing the warrior to attack, Var uses the 
warrior's actions to cast his spells through it. 
When Var becomes aware of the group through a 
dread warrior, the warrior's eyes glow with pale light. 
If someone casts counterspell or dispel magic on the 
dread warrior during this time, and successfully dispels 
a 5th-level spell, Var's connection is suppressed for 1 
minute. Preemptively casting dispel magic on a dread 
warrior can have the same effect. 
RANDOM ENCOUNTERS 
Random encounters help determine if characters meet 
other creatures moving through the Doomvault. Con­
sider rolling for an encounter in these circumstances: 
• The party enters a zone within which they've previ­
ously defeated most of the monsters. 
• The party moves between zones while the Doomvault 
has an alert level of 6 or higher. 
, The alert level rises. 
These encounters are more for atmosphere than chal­
lenge. Any random encounter should be foreshadowed 
with noise or other cues. If a result you roll makes no 
sense for a given area, select a different result that does. 
At least one creature in a random encounter has a 
glyph key attuned to the zone it is in or an adjacent zone. 
In cases where foes have no way to enter an area, they 
instead follow the party into that area. 
ENCOUNTER TYPE 
If a random encounter is indicated, roll on the Encoun­
ter Type table, adding the current alert level to the roll. 
Then roll on the indicated table to determine the en­
counter specifics. Statistics for entries marked with (B) 
on the tables are found in appendix B of this book.

PECIAL ENCOUNTERS 
If creatures leave their normal areas to roam the dun­
geon, add them to your notes as possible special encoun­
ters. If necessary, Syranna covertly helps such creatures 
move about the dungeon to add to the confusion and to 
aid the overall mission. When you roll a special encoun­
ter, you can choose from among the creatures in your 
notes or roll randomly. If a creature is eliminated , delete 
it from your list of possible special encounters. If you 
roll this result while no special encounters exist, then 
the group has an encounter of your choice. 
TREASURE 
The adventure has some treasure built in, but the char­
acters might be able to find more. 
Changing Treasure. Feel free to change the treasure 
in the Doomvault or add more. It's especially appropri­
ate to change treasure to something characters in the 
party can use, and it's satisfying to let them claim it from 
a defeated monster or Thayan. For instance. if you'd like 
co give a character a magic weapon, you can change a 
weapon-using monster to account for the treasure. Thayans' Potions. Each group ofThayans has among 
chem ld4 -2 potions (minimum 0), each one deter­
mined by rolling on the following table. 
2d4 Potion 
2 Flying 
3-4 Climbing 
5-7 Healing (1-3), greater healing (4-5), superior healing (6) 
8 Invisibility 
Red Wizards. Each Red Wizard encountered in the 
adventure carries 4d10 gp. A Red Wizard also carries 
ld4-2 (minimum 0) spell scrolls, each containing a ran­
dom arcane spell of 1st or 2nd level, most often darkvi­
sion, daylight, detect magic, identify, invisibility, or thun­
derwave. Twenty-five percent of Red Wizards (determine 
randomly using a d4) instead have one 3rd-level spell 
scroll, either of dispel magic or remove curse. 
Dread Warriors. A dread warrior carries no gold, but 
some of them have weapons or armor, determined by 
rolling on the following table. 
2d4 Item 
2-6 None 
7 +1 weapon (usually a battleaxe or a javelin) 
8 +7 chain mail 
CHARACTER DEATH 
When a character dies, the player has a few options. 
SOUL BINDING 
The rebel Red Wizards can use the mighty magic of the 
Doomvault , which traps souls, to raise fallen adventur­
ers as soul-bound dead. If a player chooses this option, 
the dead character returns to play with no changes. 
Syranna warns such characters that a soul-bound 
creature created in this way will die permanently upon 
leaving the Doomvault. Furthermore, over the course of 
many weeks, a character who remains in this state loses 
any identity and becomes a wight under the control of 
the Red Wizards. To have any hope of exiting the dun­
geon, the character must end the soul-bound condition. 
Syranna conveys that the undying laboratory (area 
31) allows soul-bound characters to transform back to 
normal, but she lacks the knowledge of how this feat is 
accomplished. 
NEW CHARACTER 
The player selects or creates a new character who joins 
the group. Syranna coordinates uniting newcomers 
with a group in the dungeon. Such characters might be 
Thayan Resurrection members anxious to join the fight 
against Szass Tam. The new character could have been 
a prisoner in the Doomvault, released to help the rebels. 
Regardless of origin, the character arrives with the nec­
essary resources and information to join the party. 
DOOMVAULT LORE 
Some creatures that the characters encounter can 
divulge important information about the Doomvault. 
When you give out lore, reveal information appropriate 
to the creature being questioned based on its location 
and circumstance. You can make information more 
CHAPTER 5 I DEAD lN THAY ll5

1!6 specific and useful, but the basics of the lore should 
be conveyed. 
SECTORS 
Some pieces of lore are threats and rumors known to 
those without firsthand experience of a sector. Crea­
tures inside a sector are likely to know more specific de­
tails, especially about their neighboring zones; the DM 
is encouraged to provide appropriate details wherever 
creatures are noted to have lore to offer. 
• In the Abyssal Prisons, the maze of undoing (area 15) 
has no easy exit, but fiends that can climb are said to 
have somehow escaped the magic there. 
, In the Far Realm Cysts, the creatures of chaos keep 
intruders away from a powerful shrine. 
In the Forests of Slaughter, the most cunning hunters 
seek to steal glyph keys. 
In the Forests of Slaughter, magic pools can heal crea­
tures that drink from them. 
, In the Golem Laboratories, no Red Wizard will enter 
the glowing green archways. 
, In the Masters' Domain, the Temples of Despair are 
used for the torture and execution of those who op­
pose Szass Tam. 
, In the Masters' Domain, necromancy can be reshaped 
to restore life. 
, In the Ooze Grottos, the power of the white pillar can 
heal or harm. 
, In the Predator Pools, the hag seeks allies in her plot 
against the naga. 
, In the Predator Pools, vats hold power over life. 
TEMPLES OF EXTRACTION 
Pieces of lore about the Temples of Extraction are pre­
sented in the order in which they should be revealed: 
, The Temples of Extraction aren't temples at all but re­
search facilities where Szass Tam's followers conduct 
profane magical experiments. Few know the specifics 
of what happens there. 
Only black gates allow access to the Temples of Ex­
traction. Only Szass Tam's most trusted servants have 
the glyph keys attuned to that sector. 
, Szass Tam's latest plan to become a god is his most 
ambitious. He intends to feed the souls of the Chosen 
into his phylactery through the Temples of Extraction. 
Szass Tam is making sure that his plan will work by 
channeling the souls of the Chosen into the phylacter­
ies of his underlings, which are stored in the Phylac­
tery Vault beneath the Doomvault. 
, Disrupting the flow of soul energy into the phylacter­
ies should destroy them, dealing an incalculable blow 
to Szass Tam's power. 
PHYLACTERY VAULT 
Pieces of lore about the Phylactery Vault are presented 
in the order in which they should be revealed: 
, Beneath the Doomvault, the demilich Kazit Gui slum­
bers in his Phylactery Vault. 
Szass Tam repurposed the Phylactery Vault for his 
own magical experiments. 
CHAPTER 5 I DEAD IN THAY The phylacter ies of the highest-ranking liches in 
Szass Tam's service rest in the Phylactery Vault, pro­
tected by powerful magic. Szass Tam holds the phylac­
teries there to keep his lackeys in check. 
If enough black gates across the Doomvault are dis­
rupted, the black gates in the Temples of Extraction 
can be forced to connect to the Phylactery Vault. 
INTO THE DOOMVAULT 
The characters arrive in the Doomvault through the 
Bloodgate Nexus or a similar magic portal. How and 
why they come is up to you. Perhaps the Thayan rebels 
call for help, alerting forces on the Sword Coast that 
some of those who assaulted the Bloodgate are alive but 
captive in the Doomvault. Maybe Syranna snatches he­
roes from somewhere in the world near another magic 
gateway. In any case, the characters arrive in the dun­
geon's gatehouse by teleportation. 
To start the adventure, read: 
You arrive in a shadowy hall with glowing teleportation 
circles etched into the floor. Before you have time to con· 
sider your situation, the image of a female Red Wizard 
suddenly appears and speaks. 
"I am Syranna," she says. "It was I who brought you 
here. Welcome to Thay." 
Syranna is present only as an image through which she 
can sense and communicate. She goes on as follows. 
"Many Red Wizards chafe under the rule of Szass Tam. 
Once, Thay was a land of learning and power. Now, 
death scours Thay while the lich lord ignores all concerns 
other than his quest to become a god. If his mad plans 
are left to run their course, none will be left alive here to 
worship him. 
"This is a magic gatehouse, from which I can send you 
to the Doomvault-the heart of the lich lord's domain 
deep beneath the Thaymount. The Doomvault is a secret 
laboratory and containment structure, beneath which 
lies a hidden storehouse where the phylacteries of Szass 
Tam's elite liches are held. There, the lich lord's power 
can be broken ... with your aid. 
"I offer you an opportunity to take the fight to the lich 
lord. I offer you the chance to help me see to it that Szass 
Tam's power is broken. The Phylactery Vault is where you 
can make that happen. 
"What say you?" 
Syranna is a rebellion leader who knows that her life 
could end at any time. She means to make every mo­
ment count. She doesn't rest while the characters as­
sault the Doomvault. 
Syranna is lawful neutral. She has a sense of righ­
teousness colored by fatalism. Her belief is that death

118 is better than being raised as another of Sza Tam 
undead servants. With the characters , she i hone_ and 
forthright, as well as cynical. 
Unfortunately for the characters, Syranna isn·t famil­
iar with the inside of the Doomvault. Her position a 
overseer of the gatehouse has given her only general 
knowledge of the dungeon . She explains that her igno­
rance is an intentional part of the dungeon 's security 
structure . If given time, however, she can confirm 
Doomvault lore that the characters learn. 
Syranna can relate the following information to the 
characters: 
• For centuries , the Doomvault was a legend. Kazit Gui, 
a Red Wizard who spent his life studying the deadliest 
dungeons on many worlds, planned it. As a living hu­
man and a lich, Gui fashioned the vast complex based 
on his research. The purpose of the dungeon was to 
lure explorers to their deaths and harvest their souls 
to fuel Gui's phylactery. 
• As Thay became more hostile to outsiders, fewer peo­
ple sought the Doomvault. Eventually , unable to fuel 
his phylactery , Gui became a demilich. Szass Tam 
discovered the Doomvault and saw the opportunity to 
rebuild and repurpose it. 
• The Doomvault is a vast, active complex of labo­
ratories and menageries dedicated to creating the 
monstrous armies with which the Red Wizards plan 
to conquer first the North, then all of Faerun. The dun­
geon is divided into sectors dedicated to the creation 
and control of specific types of monsters. 
Each sector is subdivided into protected zones for 
security, defending against attack from outside and 
betrayal from within, as well as the escape of con­
fined creatures. Magical white gates block corridors , 
preventing physical access between zones. Magical 
black gates are teleportation circles that connect dif­
ferent parts of the dungeon. Syranna describes each 
gate type's appearance so the characters know the 
gates by sight. 
Magic crystals called glyph keys, when attuned to a 
zone, allow access to that zone's gates. Syranna de­
scribes the use of glyph keys, including how to trans­
fer attunements. She also describes contact stones 
and how the characters can use them to contact her 
directly. Through contact stones, the characters can 
also gain glyph key attunements for the zone in which 
the contact stone is situated. Syranna initially provides 
the party with one glyph key. 
• The characters have three goals: (1) Destroy the Red 
Wizards' monstrous creations and experiments to end 
the threat to Faerun. (2) Gain access to the Phylactery 
Vault deep beneath the dungeon. (3) Destroy the phy­
lacteries within the vault. 
Tami Var's quarters lie in the Doomvault . Although 
the lich was defeated, he might have already remateri­
alized thanks to the power of his phylactery . Protected 
by his dread warriors, he is a deadly threat. 
• Syranna provides information on dread warriors and 
how Tami Var uses them. 
• Szass Tam controls entry to the Phylactery Vault. 
Syranna knows the vault connects to the greater 
Doomvault, but hasn't discovered how to access it. 
CHAPTER 5 I DEAD IN THAY MAP 5,3: ABYSSAL PRISONS 
• The rebels will use their power to stop magical com­
munications to the outside and contain any enemies 
who escape from the Doomvault. They'll make sure 
that no one outside the dungeon knows of or reacts to 
what's happening until the characters succeed. 
• Thayans have taken two adventurers , Shalendra 
Floshin and Kelson Darktreader , prisoner. They are 
likely dead or within the Doomvault. 
Once the characters are finished talking, Syranna tele­
ports in a map of the dungeon for the party (give the 
players map 5.2) and a glyph key attuned to the zone you 
chose as an entry point. She wishes the party well. 
ABYSSAL PRISONS 
Originally an area containing summoning traps, this 
sector has been changed into a place for confining de­
mons. Thayans break the will of imprisoned fiends and 
bind them into service. 
Locations in the Abyssal Prisons are identified 
on map 5.3. 
Light. Dim light radiates from the walls, floors, and 
ceilings in this sector, a manifestation of strengthened 
dimensional barriers that prevent fiends from teleport­
ing or summoning other demons within the sector. 
FIENDISH ARENA 
In this zone, a vampire named Issem culls the weakest 
demons using arena combat. When the demons fight, 
the battle can be heard in every chamber in this zone 
(see "Pit Battle" in area 2 to aid in narrating the noise).

Negotiation. Prisoners regularly move through the

~ough by talking to Eldrath, a female human vampire 
:pawn that challenges them. If the characters fail to talk 
eir way through or make it obvious in any way that 
ey don't belong here, the monsters attack.

of past bloodshed. 
Creatures. Issem, a pale human vampire in lavish 
othes, is normally in this area, watching battles . 
. Vegotiation. An old curse binds Issem to the Doom­
ult and to the service of the Thayans, but he hates the 
_ ed Wizards, so he is willing to talk. He can offer two 
eces of lore (see "Doomvault Lore," page 115), and 
allows prisoners and the characters to leave the area. 
-=e is willing to lie to any Thayans who seek the charac­
and help them cover their tracks. 
I sem warns anyone who tries to enter area 3 against 
ing so. If someone does anyway, the vampire attacks. 
Fighting Pit. This rough-hewn arena is 15 feet lower 
:ian the floor around it and imbued with magic. Any 
n-undead creature that approaches within 10 feet 
: the edge must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving 
ow or be compelled to leap into the pit (a creature 
:::nores this effect if immune to being charmed). Such a 
-eature can't leave the pit until all the demons within it 
:-e destroyed. The pit is otherwise easy to climb. 
Pit Battle. In the pit, a reduced-threat vrock (see 
educed-Threat Monsters," page 113) is fighting ten 
-oners, nine of whom are human commoners. The 
h is a gold elf knight named Shalendra Floshin. 
-= alf the humans each deal 1 slashing damage to the 
k each round, and Shalendra deals 10 damage to 
,. vrock every round. The demon focuses on one target

Development. If the characters succeed in getting 
Issem to cover for them, the Doomvault's alert level de­
creases by 1. 
Shalendra. Thayans captured Shalendra during the 
assault on the Bloodgate. She has managed to survive 
and help other prisoners stay alive. While doing so, she 
has learned one piece of lore. Shalendra asks for a glyph 
key; if given one, she goes to the gatehouse to recuper­
ate. If not, she goes looking for a key on her own. Either 
way, before she leaves, she can help the party for a time 
if they (and you) wish. 
White Gates. The corridor to the east contains a 
white gate that connects with the Temple of Chaos. An­
other white gate stands in the corridor that leads south 
to the Pools of Devotion. 
3. lSSEM1S VAULT 
Deadly traps, which Issem avoids while in mist form, 
protect the vampire's sarcophagus. 
This chamber has walls draped in black silk. Gleaming 
prisms float in midair, spinning slowly. At the center of 
the area, a great sarcophagus with its lid pushed ajar 
stands atop a stone dais. Along the upper edge of the 
sarcophagus, a series of arcane glyphs pulses with pale 
white light. 
CHAPTER 5 I DEAD TN THAY Il9

Cursed Prisms. Unless Issem is in the room, each 
character who is in the room and can see the prisms 
must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw at the start 
each of his or her turns. The first time each character 
fails the save, a wraith that looks like a shadowy dupli­
cate of that character erupts from a prism and attacks. 
Pit Traps. As shown on the map, the floor has many 
pit traps. 
Contact Stone. The glyphs on the sarcophagus cause 
it to serve as a contact stone. 
Treasure. Inside the sarcophagus are six spell scrolls 
(three of detect magic, two of comprehend languages, 
and one of greater restoration). Also inside is a bottle of 
ink and an ink pen with fifteen sheets of parchment. 
Glyph Key. In addition to its treasure, the sarcopha­
gus holds a glyph key attuned to this zone. 
CHAPTER 5 I DEAD IN THAY LlPLE OF CHAOS

-r. _,!YSTIC CIRCLES 
-e ood-paneled walls of this long hall are scorched. 
Crac s in the panels reveal bare stone. Three mystic 
c1rc es have been scribed in the floor, each edged with 
rough runes. 
Locked Doors. These steel double doors are locked. 
Tarul Var (area 10) has a key in his possession. 
Steel Orb. A magic steel orb is hidden in a recess in 
the ceiling 20 feet up. Spotting it requires a successful 
DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. The steel orb is part 
of the mystic circle trap. 
Mystic Circle Trap. The circles are magical but mis­
leadingly so. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) 
check reveals that hidden among gibberish runes are 
warding glyphs that discharge lightning. If the check 
fails, the character discerns the false runes but doesn't 
notice the glyphs. 
The trap activates 3 rounds after a creature enters 
the room. (Tarul Var's steel key disables the trap for 1 
minute when it is used to open the door to area 5.) At the 
start of the fourth round, and every 2 rounds thereafter , 
one circle (chosen randomly) glows white. At the end of 
the same round, lightning discharges through the room 
from the steel orb in the ceiling. When the lightning 
discharges , any creature in the room must make a DC 
10 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature 
takes 7 (2d6) lightning damage. 
A character who touches the steel orb and succeeds 
on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check can suppress 
the orb's magic, disabling the trap for ld4 rounds. A dis­
pel magic spell cast on the orb suppresses the magic for 
1 hour. In both cases, the character doesn't know how 
long the suppression might last. The circles continue to 
glow at random. 
White Gate. The corridor that separates this area 
from the Fiendish Arena contains a white gate. 
5. SUCCUBUS VAULT 
The sweet scent of incense hangs in the hot air of this 
opulent chamber. The walls are covered with silk tap­
estries in green and yellow, and the floors are spread 
with cushions. To the south, two sets of sliding double 
wooden doors are set in the walls. 
Creatures. Pencheska, a succubus , resides here with 
four Thayan warriors (see appendix B), who are in her 
thrall. Pencheska is an unwilling servant of Tarul Var.

directly oppose the characters unless they anac · er. 
:he is willing to provide a piece of lore about the Phylac­
:ery Vault in the hope that the characters might de troy 
:arul Var for good, freeing her to escape the Doomrnult. 
Closets. The sliding wooden doors open to reveal 
~ osets that contain fine female clothing in numerous 
s:yles and sizes. The easternmost closet contains a 
emispherical stone in the middle of its back wall. The 
;,·one serves as a contact stone in this zone. 
Heat. This chamber is uncomfortably hot due to the 
:::-e elemental in area 6. The heat grows more intense to 
· he east and in the eastern secret passage. 
Treasure. Pencheska's adornments include a gold gor­
;et set with yellow topazes (500 gp), matching earrings 
_SQ gp), a ruby ring (300 gp), an intricate jade necklace 
~oo gp) and two matching jade rings (200 gp each). 
In the westernmost closet, hooks hold several items 
. jewelry, including a simple gold necklace and bracelet 
_ -0 gp each), a silver necklace with a garnet pendant 
_ -o gp), and an ivory necklace (100 gp). 
Glyph Key. Pencheska has a glyph key attuned to this 
::: ne, which hangs in the closet among her jewelry. 
. ELEMENTAL FURNACE 
-. character who listens at either doorway feels heat and 
ars a crackling roar. 
A blast of heat escapes as the door opens. A howling 
creature of flame roils at the center of a soot-streaked 
stone chamber whose walls are lined with glowing runes. 
Creature. The fire elemental here flares out toward 
ny creature it can see, but the runes on the wall glow 
ore brightly when it does, and it stops short of making 
~ontact with any intruder. The elemental can't attack or 
~ave the room. Instead, it babbles in Ignan (a dialect of 
?:-imordial), often using the word "home." Even though 
e elemental doesn't attack, any creature that ends its 
urn in the room takes 3 (ld6) fire damage as long as the 
emental is present. 
The runes on the wall are a set of arcane bonds that 
· ep the elemental confined here. A character who 
:nakes a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check 
~ · cerns the connection. If a character who can cast 
;,pells then succeeds on three consecutive DC 15 In­
·elligence (Arcana) checks while continually touching 
:he wall, the bonds are suppressed long enough for the 
e.emental to leave the room. A dispel magic spell cast on 
e runes suppresses the bonds for 1 minute. 
The elemental follows its rescuer, fighting alongside 
· at person. If the elemental sees the rift in area 7, it 
· es the rift to leave the Doomvault and return to the 
::.lemental Plane of Fire. 
White Gate. A white gate is located east of this area 
· rhe junction of the corridors that lead to the Abyssal 
ate and to the Vermin Halls. 7. CHAOS RIFT 
Characters approaching this area can hear the roar of 
the elemental rift, which also generates bright light in 
the entire chamber. 
This enormous hall is set with rows of pillars carved 
in the shapes of elemental and demonic creatures. A 
great rift has been torn in the center of the stone floor. 
Through it, a stream of chaotic energy blasts upward, 
flowing into a similar rift in the vaulted ceiling forty feet 
above. Tendrils split off from the pulsing column of en­
ergy, lashing out to strike the nearest pillars. 
In the southwest corner is a black gate. 
A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (Ar­
cana) check can tell that the rift is channeling elemental 
forces. If the check succeeds by 5 or more, the character 
knows that the rift is dangerous and is channeling ex­
traplanar elemental forces . 
If a non-elemental creature ends its turn inside the 
room, it takes 5 (2d4) damage of a random type (roll 
a dlO: 1-2, acid; 3-4, cold; 5-6, fire; 7-8, lightning; 
9-10, thunder). 
Any creature that enters the rift can choose to remain 
here or go to an elemental plane. Characters who go to 
an elemental plane must use the rift to return on their 
next turn or they become trapped. 
ABYSSAL GATE 
Tarul Var oversees this zone, in which the Thayans have 
tapped Abyssal power. 
8. SUMMONING CHAMBER 
A character listening at the doors can hear the shrieks 
of any demons bound here. 
This area might once have been a great banquet hall, but 
its furnishings now lie in rotting piles along the walls. 
Between rows of pillars, six great magic circles glow 
brightly, illuminating the whole chamber. 
Creatures. One dread warrior (see appendix B), two 
wights, and six zombies patrol the area. 
Summoning Circles. Two summoning circles are 
empty. The other four contain creatures: 
Circle A. One reduced-threat hezrou (see 
"Reduced-Threat Monsters," page 113) 
Circle B. Four quasits 
Circle C. One reduced-threat vrock (see 
"Reduced-Threat Monsters," page 113) 
Circle D. Ten manes 
A bound demon can't escape from its circle without 
assistance, and aside from attempts to communicate, 
nothing it does can affect anything outside the circle. 
All demons except for the manes ask to be released, 
promising to attack the Thayan forces if they are freed. 
CHAPTER 5 DEAD IN THAY 
121 

--- PAGE 123 ---

I22 TARUL VAR, LICH 
With a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check, 
a character knows that, as an action, they can scuff the 
boundary of a circle to disrupt the circle's magic for 1 
minute. During that time, a demon within the circle can 
break free with a successful DC 15 Wisdom check. 
A freed demon attacks the nearest creature that 
isn't a demon. 
Development. If any demon other than the manes 
remains free in this area, all the demons are eventually 
freed from their circles by the others. They spill out into 
the zone and attack any creature they find. That fact 
should be noted as part of the dungeon state. 
White Gates. A white gate is located north of this area 
at the junction of the corridors that lead to the Temple of 
Chaos and to the Vermin Halls. Another gate lies in the 
passage to the east that connects with the Swine Run.

pa age in a long time. 
If examined with a detect magic spell, the area dis­
plays an aura of necromancy. 
Stunning Shadow Trap. If the doors are opened, roll 
initiative . Darkness immediately fills the corridor out to 
20 feet from the doors. Any non-undead creature that 
starts its turn in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Cha­
risma saving throw or take 7 (2d6) necrotic damage and 
become paralyzed until the start of its next turn. The 
darkness remains as long as the doors are open. 
10. TARUL VAR1S QUARTERS 
Tapestries line the walls of these well-appointed living 
quarters. Standing screens divide the space into smaller 
sections containing couches, tables, and desks. 
Creatures. Here resides the lich Tarul Var with his 
guards, four dread warriors (see appendix B for both 
stat blocks). Having lost the Bloodgate, Var is confined 
to this area because of his fear of Szass Tam, while he 
awaits his master's final judgment. 
The lich attacks immediately. His guards emerge 
from various positions to screen him from direct attack. 
Tarul Var can cast any of his spells from one of the 
dread warriors. 
The dread warriors attempt to drag any helpless char­
acters to the pit in the intersection near this room or to 
area 9, where they throw open the doors. 
Devious and arrogant , Tarul Var thinks all other crea­
tures are beneath him. He berates the characters at ev­
ery opportunity , and he drives his underlings to cruelty. 
If reduced to 30 hit points or fewer, Var offers the 
party access to his glyph key's attunements and his 
steel key (see "Treasure " below), as well as two pieces of 
lore, in exchange for his freedom and his silence. If the 
characters let Var go, he flees the Doomvault, reasoning 
that the characters' disruptions will draw Szass Tam's 
attention away from him. If the lich is destroyed here, he 
might later be destroyed permanently if the party suc­
ceeds in collapsing the Phylactery Vault. 
Contact Stone. A circle of glowing glyphs above Var's 
desk in the western section of the room serves as a con­
tact stone. 
Treasure. A search of the desk reveals several drafts 
of a letter to Szass Tam in which Var begs for another 
chance to bring the Sword Coast under Thayan domi­
nation. Inside the desk's several drawers are a potion 
of mind reading and a duplicate of the steel key that 
Var carries. 
The largest drawer of the desk is held closed with 
an arcane lock spell (requiring a successful DC 25 
Strength check to break). Inside is a flat box of black 
wood (see the next subsection) and a gold coffer 
wrought to look like a sleeping dragon with violet garnet 
eyes (worth 1,000 gp). The coffer holds 200 pp and a 
dark, smooth river rock (a Joadstone; see appendix A). 

--- PAGE 124 ---

True Name Box. If detect magic is used on_,, · ack 
box, the contents give off an aura of evoca ·on ::na5ic. 
The box contains several pieces of parchmen·. A porJon 
of the top page stored in the box has runes on i· rha . 
when read by anyone other than Tarul Var. cause the 
page to explode. 
The runes can be neutralized by using dispel magic 
on the box or the page. Alternatively , a character who 
;nakes a successful DC 10 Intelligence check can re­
::nove the page from the box without inadvertently read­
..ng the runes. If the check fails, the character reads the 
:-tmes accidentally , triggering the explosion . 
If the page explodes, everyone within 10 feet of the 
:>OX must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, which 
:he reader makes with disadvantage. A creature takes 
21 (6d6) force damage on a failed saving throw and half 
much damage on a successful one. The box and its 
contents are destroyed if the runes go off. 
The box contains records of true names of minor dev-
and describes plans to use them in the attack on the 
-word Coast. It also contains historical documents that 
iidicate that Var was searching for the true name of a 
pit fiend called Baazka. 
Keys. Tarul Var carries a glyph key attuned to this 
zone and to the Temples of Anguish (in the Temples 
f Extraction sector). He also has an ornate steel key 
·orth 5 gp) that opens the locked doors on the east wall 
f area 4. 
.1. TORTURE CHAMBER 
_.\ character who listens at the doors can hear the howls 
: the glabrezu if it's bound here. 
The walls of this torture chamber are hung with chains 
and spears encrusted with black ichor. In a few places, 
heavy black chains are fastened to the floor. In the north· 
east corner is a black gate. 
Creatures. A wight and seven skeletons are tor­
;:;ienting a prone, reduced-threat glabrezu (see "Re­
:iuced-Threat Monsters," page 113) that is shackled 
and chained to the floor in four places. The undead at­
::ack interlopers, using pikes as weapons (ldlO piercing 
.:iamage). The undead have magic weapons (see "Trea­
sure" below). 
Shackled Glabrezu. The bound glabrezu can't free 
_. elf. It can't cast spells or summon demons. It can at­
:ack only if a creature comes within 5 feet of it, which is 
hy the undead are using pikes. When a battle starts, 
:....e demon demands to be freed, promising to "lay waste 
-o these undead and their masters." If the characters 
:-efuse to aid it, the demon attacks them if it can. 
To free the demon, a character must pick the locks 
fall four iron shackles (requiring a successful DC 15 
=::>exterity check for each). If it is freed, the glabrezu ram­
;>ages, randomly attacking anyone in reach. Once free, it 
can cast spells, but it still can't summon demons. 
Shackles. The ten sets of shackles and their chains 
are made of rune-scribed iron. A demon held in them 
::an't escape them while the shackles are closed. The magic on the chains renders them unbreakable, so they 
can't be removed from this room. 
Dungeon State. If the glabrezu is left free in this 
area, it eventually frees the demons in area 8 from their 
circles. That fact should be noted as part of the dun­
geon state. 
Treasure. The skeletons' pikes are enchanted with 
magic weapon (+l) for 1 more hour. The wight wields 
a +1 pike. 
HALLS OF CONDITIONING 
After their initial subjugation, captured demons are held 
in the Halls of Conditioning, where they are properly 
broken to service. 
12. FALSE PIT GAUNTLET 
Communicate the boxed text before any character 
crosses the threshold into this room. 
The walls here consist of worked stone, but the thirty­
foot-high ceiling of this broad chamber features rough 
rock hung with jagged stalactites. Seams in the floor tiles 
divide the space into squares five feet on a side. An open 
pit extends halfway across each of the four entryways, 
just inside the room. 
Aura. A detect magic spell cast on this area reveals 
that magic permeates the entire room, focused most 
strongly at the open mouth of each pit. 
False Pits. The pits appear normal, but an invisible 
force field extends across the apparently open space 
atop each pit. The horizontal field can hold the weight of 
any number of characters. 
Gravity Trap. Any creature that enters the room and 
walks across the invisible field covering one of the open 
pits deactivates the gravity trap for 1 minute. Once deac­
tivated, characters can move freely across the room for 
1 minute before the trap reactivates. If the trap is active, 
any creature that enters the room without stepping onto 
the invisible field over one of the false pits is hurled to­
ward the ceiling, taking 10 (3d6) piercing damage from 
the stalactites and remaining restrained on the ceiling 
for 1 minute. Then the creature is released and drops 
to the floor, taking 10 (3d6) falling damage and landing 
prone in a random square near the center of the cham­
ber. Moving onto or over the floor triggers the gravity 
trap again, but the creature can remain safe if it stays 
in the space where it fell until another character deacti­
vates the trap. 
13. SORLAN 'S HAUNT 
The lock plainly visible on each of the double doors is 
false. The real locks and keyholes are hidden in the base 
of each door and detectable with a successful DC 15 
Wisdom (Perception) check. If any attempt is made to 
pick a false lock or force the doors, any creature within 
10 feet of the doors must succeed on a DC 14 Constitu­
tion saving throw (with disadvantage, if trying to pick a 
lock or force the doors) or take 5 (2d4) force damage and 
be knocked prone. 
CHAPTER 5 I DEAD IN THAY

--- PAGE 125 ---

r24 This ruined chamber has tapestries and paintings that 
have been slashed and are shot through with black mold. 
The fine furnishings and cushions are rotted through and 
crumbling, and the air is heavy with the scent of decay. 
Creature. Sorlan, a former adventurer who was im­
prisoned by the Red Wizards and subjected to horrible 
experiments , lives on as a ghost that is bound to this 
room. He hates the Red Wizards, and he immediately 
tries to attack all who enter his chamber , screaming that 
allies of the Red Wizards must die. If the characters 
convince Sorlan that they are opposed to the Red Wiz­
ards by making a successful DC 15 Charisma (Persua­
sion) check, the ghost stops attacking and can provide 
two pieces of lore, which he has overheard from passing 
Red Wizards. 
Sorlan also tells the characters to avoid the maze 
of undoing (area 15), which is where he was captured 
while trying to escape the dungeon. He doesn't know the 
trick to overcoming the teleportation trap. If he is slain, 
Sorlan reappears in this area 24 hours later. 
White Gate. The secret door on the west wall opens 
into a narrow corridor that leads to a white gate. Beyond 
the gate (and another secret door) is a corridor that con­
nects with the Pools of Devotion. 
14. DEMON CELLS 
Several cages line this chamber from floor to ceiling. 
Three of them hold various demons, which are raging 
futilely and silently against their confinement. The wall in 
the southwest corner contains a contact stone. 
Creatures. One Red Wizard conjurer oversees one 
deathlock wight and one Thayan apprentice (see ap­
pendix B for all three stat blocks). The conjurer knows 
the pass phrase for the maze of undoing (area 15) and 
might provide it to the characters in exchange for mercy, 
knowing that freed demons will attack their "rescuers." 
Cells. Cells that confine demons hold the following 
creatures: 
Cell A. One hezrou 
Cell B. Eight quasits 
Cell C. Two vrocks 
Each cell has iron, rune-scribed bars (warded against 
demons). Transmutation magic on the bars renders 
them unbreakable , so a demon can't escape the cell and, 
indeed, can't pass any part of its body between the bars. 
Further, no sound can pass out of a cell into the larger 
room. To free a demon, a character must pick the lock 
on the cage door (requiring a successful DC 20 Dexter­
ity check). A freed demon attacks everyone in the room. 
Keys. The Red Wizard has a glyph key attuned to this 
zone, as well as a ring of keys to the cells. 
Dungeon State. If any demon remains free in this 
area, all the demons are eventually freed from their 
cells. That fact should be noted as part of the dun­
geon state. 
CHAPTER 5 I DEAD IN THAY 15. MAZE OF UNDOING 
A snort hall of gray granite runs perpendicular to this ar­
ea's entrance, with six openings across from the entrance 
t at lead deeper into the darkness. The cold stone ceiling 
looms thirty feet overhead. 
Teleportation Maze. Conjuration magic infuses the 
area. emanating most strongly at the trigger points 
numbered 1 through 20, and at the two entry/exit 
trigger points labeled E on the map. In addition to the 
teleportation trigger points, the magic aligns gravity 
to the nearest surface. Therefore, creatures standing 
on the floor consider "down" to be beneath their feet, 
while creatures on the ceiling consider that surface to 
be "down" and are situated accordingly. The entire area 
was created to capture and hold demons. 
.f\ny creature that enters a trigger point on the floor 
teleports immediately to the ceiling above another trig­
ger point (determined by a d20 roll). The creature must 
then succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 
5 (2d4) psychic damage and fall to the floor, taking 10 
(3d6) falling damage and triggering another teleporta­
tion point. On a successful save, the creature takes no 
damage and can utilize the weird gravity until the end 
of its next turn, walking along the ceiling and walls as 
though they were the floor, and bypassing the teleporta­
tion triggers. If the creature is still above the floor at the 
end of its next turn, it falls the appropriate distance to 
the floor and triggers another teleportation point. l 
1 
In addition to conjuration magic , the entry/exit points 
also radiate abjuration magic. Until someone utters the 
proper pass phrase (see area 14), a demon caught in the 
maze can't pass through either of the entry/exit points. 
For non-demons , leaving the maze can be accomplished 
by moving along the walls or ceiling and out of the area 
through either entry/exit point. 
Creature. When the characters arrive, a glabrezu 
is trapped in the maze. The demon has learned how to 
navigate the maze, even though it can't escape the area. 
Place the demon on the ceiling above a random telepor­
tation trigger point in the maze (roll a d20). Once the 
demon notices the characters, it moves toward charac­
ters it can see and in its rage and madness attacks any 
creatures it manages to reach. 
Black Gate. A black gate is set into the southern al­
cove, not immediately visible from the entrance. 
BLOOD PENS 
The Red Wizards are breeding and raising monsters in 
their own foul nurseries. 
Locations in the Blood Pens are identified on map 5.4. 
VERMIN HALLS 
The vermin-summoning magic of these halls now 
serves the Thayans. 
16. GALLERY OF SWARMS 
The Red Wizards no longer use this chamber. 

--- PAGE 126 ---

Sounds. A character who listens at the doo­
-ucceeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception c 
distant chittering. 
Light. None. 
The sunken floor of this huge hall is covered I ceac 
sects, their dried shells shifting and whispering I a 'a -
breeze. Dozens of demonic faces are carved ·n t e 
marble walls of the chamber, slight gusts whistling from 
each of their open mouths. Down the center of the cham­
ber, toward the doors at the far end, a series of black 
stone platforms are set like oversized stepping stones. 
Demonic Faces. The mouths of these relief carvings 
are the source of the magical breeze. 
Insect Floor. The floor is 2 feet below the level of the 
doors and filled completely with dead insects along with 
occasional bones, making it difficult terrain. 
Pit Traps. Scattered through the room, hidden be­
neath the blanket of insect bodies, are several pit traps. 
• is impossible to notice a pit passively; finding one re­
quires a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. 
Sach pit is filled with dead insects, so falling into one 
deals only half damage. Someone buried in a pit full of 
these husks can't breathe or see. 
Trapped Platforms. Whenever a creature steps onto 
a platform, it must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution sav­
~og throw or be engulfed by a swarm of biting, stinging 
~sects that emerge from the demonic faces. The crea­
·ure takes 5 (2d4) piercing damage and 5 (2d4) poison 
amage, and must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving 
:brow or fall off the platform in a random direction. 
:he insects die and fall to the ground immediately after 
dieir attack. 
White Gates. A white gate is located west of this area 
at the junction of the corridors that lead to the Temple of 
Chaos and to the Abyssal Gate. 
--. CRAWLING HALL 
Two enormous pillars on the far side of this chamber 
emit brilliant white light that holds the attention of doz­
ens of giant vermin crawling on and around them. The 
vermin occasionally fight among themselves, but most 
of these creatures move sluggishly, as if the light has 
subdued them. 
Glowing Pillars. The pillars emit magical light, which 
?acifies the vermin and keeps their handlers safe. 
Creatures. Two Thayan apprentices (see appendix 
B are feeding the vermin scraps and pig excrement 
:rom buckets. Six Thayan warriors (see appendix B) 
;;,uard the apprentices. All the Thayans attack as soon as 
:hey notice intruders. Each round of combat. the Thay­
ans direct one giant spider and one giant centipede to 
join the fight. 'Gl)C ~ 
D001nvautr 
MAP 5.4: BLOOD PENS 
Development. Vermin left in this chamber grow hun­
gry, feeding on any dead creatures. Within a few hours, 
they begin killing and feeding on each other. 
Glyph Key. One Thayan has a glyph key attuned to 
this zone. 
White Gate. A white gate is located in the south 
branch of the corridor that leads east from this area to­
ward the Swine Run. 
18. BARRACKS 
Rough cots scattered across the floor contrast with the 
decor in the east end of the room, which contains a 
great seat of white marble. Some of the magic lights are 
shrouded, so that side of the room is dimly lit. 
In the northeast corner is a black gate. West of it is a 
contact stone. 
Creatures. Six Thayan apprentices and eight 
Thayan warriors (see appendix B for both stat blocks) 
are resting here, watched over by a wight. Half the war­
riors and apprentices are asleep in the eastern side of 
the chamber. When the other creatures notice the char­
acters, they attack. The sleeping Thayans awaken and 
join the fight over the course of 2 or 3 rounds. 
Throne Swarm Trap. The 20-foot-tall white throne 
is a magic trap that the Thayans might use if desperate. 
When any non-undead creature climbs onto it, a swarm 
of stinging insects pours out of the back of the throne 
and quickly fills the chamber. Each creature in the room 
takes 9 (2d8) piercing damage and 9 (2d8) poison dam-
CHAPTER 5 I DEAD IN THAY 125 

--- PAGE 127 ---

126 age. For 1 minute thereafter, each creature that ends its 
turn in the room takes 4 (ld8) piercing damage and 4 
(ld8) poison damage. The insects disappear after 1 min­
ute, and the trap resets. 
Glyph Keys. One Thayan has a glyph key attuned to 
this zone and the Swine Run. Another has a glyph key 
attuned to this zone and the Hatchery. 
White Gate. A white gate is located in the south 
branch of the corridor that leads west from this area to­
ward the Swine Run. 
SWINE RUN 
These adjoining halls have been converted into a pig 
farm to feed carnivorous monsters. 
19. WALKWAY PEN 
Sounds. The unmistakable squealing and grunting of 
pigs can be heard from outside any of the entrances. 
Blocked Stairs. Slabs of stone, each 5 feet high, block 
the staiiS that descend into this hall along the north 
and east sides. Climbing over a slab costs 10 feet of 
movement. Once over a slab, a character can step onto a 
plank bridge (see below). 
Knocking a slab down requires a successful DC 20 
Strength check. If a slab is knocked down, the bridge 
collapses and packs of pigs rush into the open area (see 
"Pigpens" below). 
What once must have been a great hall is now a great 
swine pen. Three rows of thick pillars support the ceiling. 
Each pillar is marked with a large X in red paint. Pigs, 
perhaps hundreds of them, are packed in here, shoulder 
to shoulder, on the floor. Ten feet above them, skeletal 
undead stand on a crude bridge of wooden planks, 
dumping food into the pigpen. 
Creatures. Three deathlock wights (see appendix B) 
oversee six skeletons. They attack intruders. 
Aura. A detect magic spell reveals a transmutation 
aura on the whole area, which is a simple magical effect 
to control the pigs' odor. 
Bridges. A series of unsteady plank bridges runs 10 
feet above the floor, lashed to the pillars and to the slabs 
of rock that block the eastern stairs. Any creature that 
falls unconscious while on a bridge has a 50 percent 
chance to fall into the pigpen. 
Enchanted PiJJars. A detect magic spell reveals that 
each pillar radiates an aura of enchantment magic. Any 
humanoid that touches a pillar must succeed on a DC 
13 Wisdom saving throw or fall unconscious for 1 min­
ute. (The Thayans marked the pillars as a reminder for 
themselves.) A dispel magic spell suppresses the magic 
of the pillars for 1 minute. 
Floating Disk. An opaque, slightly concave, circular 
plane of magical force, 5 feet in diameter, floats on the 
northern side of the northern bridge to area 20. The 
CHAPTER 5 I DEAD TN THAY di-can hold up to 1,000 pounds. It is stationary and 
leYe1 with the bridge, but it can be mentally directed by 
anyone who can see it (DC 10 Intelligence) to float to the 
blocked stairway that leads up to the Vermin Halls (ar­
eas 16-18). 
Pigpens. The pigs are maltreated, hungry, and irri­
tated. They swarm any creature that enters the pen. 
uch a creature must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity 
saving throw at the start of each of its turns or take 3 
(ld6) bludgeoning damage and 3 (ld6) piercing dam­
age. Characters who take 12 damage also are knocked 
prone. Single-target attacks against the pigs have little 
effect, but an area spell clears its area of pigs until the 
end of the caster's next turn. 
The enclosed area beneath the bridge is filled with 
sows and piglets. The DC for the Dexterity saving throw 
here is only 8. 
Drevin. One pig is much smaller than the others, and 
looks especially malnourished. A detect magic spell 
reveals that the creature radiates transmutation magic. 
The pig is in fact a lightfoot halfling named Drevin. He 
was a minstrel (use the spy statistics) who ran afoul of a 
Red Wizard transmuter. If freed of the true polymorph 
spell he is under, Drevin accompanies the characters 
until he is permitted to escape the Doomvault, at which 
point he departs amid promises to write great ballads 
about the characters' exploits. 
Glyph Keys. Each wight has a glyph key attuned to 
this zone. 
20. ABATTOIR 
Empty wall niches might once have held works of art, but 
this broad gallery has now been converted to an abattoir, 
its floor slick with filth and gore. 
In the southeast corner is a black gate. North of the 
gate is a contact stone. 
If the pigs from area 19 rush into this room, they move 
unwittingly toward the skeletons, knocking half of them 
prone before retreating back into the pigpen. 
Aura. A detect magic spell reveals a faint aura of 
transmutation magic on the whole area, which is a sim­
ple magical effect to control the odor of the butchery. 
Creatures. Twelve skeletons are here, with a wight 
and a deathlock wight (see appendix B) overseeing 
them. Eight work to the east, stacking butchered pigs 
along the wall. To the west, four more work at a sluice 
that carries offal to the black gate, where it disappears 
(transported to area 41). Occasionally they toss some of 
the foul slop toward an otyugh chained to the floor. 
The otyugh can move 40 feet from the northeast cor­
ner, anywhere within the area described by the dashed 
line on the map. It attacks any creature it can reach. If it 
can't attack, the otyugh uses its turn to attempt a DC 20 
Strength check to break its chain while its captors are 
distracted. 

--- PAGE 128 ---

With its childlike intellect and telepathy, · e 
_,oadcasts its desire for more food. The charac e -are 
able to communicate with the creature. and if· ey o=er 
·o feed it, the otyugh ceases attacking for 1 round. Then 
· · e characters must periodically placate it with ucce s­
ul DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) checks. A character 
. ho frees the otyugh learns that more of its kind are in 
· e dungeon and receives a general impressi on of area 
.:.], where more otyughs live. All these otyughs hate 
· e Thayans. 
Niches. The shallow niches are 3 feet off the floor 
and 5 feet high. Climbing into a niche costs 10 feet 
-: movement. 
Dungeon State. If the otyugh is given a glyph key to 
· e Prison of Filth and told how to use a black gate, it 
eleports to area 41 and reaches area 42. Its presence 
· ere will change the characters' encounter with the 
tller otyughs (see area 42). 
Glyph Key. The wight has a glyph key attuned to this 
zone and the Prison of Filth. 
White Gates. The corridor that leads east to area 22 
the Hatchery contains a white gate. Another white 
,,ace is situated in the southern passage that connects 
"tb area 21 in the Hatchery. 
HATCHERY 
:-hayans tend and hatch the eggs of exotic monsters in 
-ese areas, rearing the young to serve Thay. 
_ l. EGG CHAMBER 
-he two approaches to this area are warm and humid. 
rleat wafts from this chamber, and steam obscures parts 
of the room. Stone braziers built into the walls burn with 
orange flame, as do braziers in various places across the 
•oom. The floor is covered with sand, on which rest doz­
ens of large eggs of various colors and textures. 
Creatures. A Red Wizard enchanter (see appendix 
3 . one dread warrior (see appendix B), and six skele­
tons oversee the eggs. If combat breaks out, the wizard 
sends the undead forward as a screen and uses targeted 
5pells that won't harm the eggs. 
Braziers. The magic stone braziers are built into the 
::-oom and can't be moved. A creature that touches a bra­
zier for the first time on a turn takes 3 (ld6) fire damage. 
Eggs. Clusters of eggs make this area difficult terrain. 
. ·one of the eggs is close to hatching. One person with 
a weapon could destroy all the eggs in about 5 minutes. 
Leaving the eggs untended also renders them lifeless. 
-rhe eggs are those of an assortment of creatures, in-
luding hook horrors, remorhazes, wyverns , and basi­
ks, with ld6 + 1 of each kind. Identifying a particular 
-·nd of egg requires a successful DC 20 Intelligen ce 
. ·ature) check. 
Steam. Steam renders this chamber lightly obscured. 
Glyph Key. The Red Wizard has a glyph key attuned 
:o this zone. White Gate. In the corridor beyond the western exit is 
a white gate that separates area 21 from the Swine Run. 
22. HATCHLING PENS 
Anyone near the doors hears the shrieking and howling 
of the caged creatures. 
Relief carvings of angelic figures along the walls of this 
huge hall contrast with the crowded iron cages here. Half 
of these cells are packed with miniature, shrieking ver­
sions of deadly monsters. 
In the southeast corner is a black gate. North of the 
gate is a contact stone. 
Aura. A detect magic spell reveals a transmutation 
aura on the whole area, which is a simple magical effect 
to control the odor of the hatchlings and their food. 
Creatures. A Red Wizard transmuter oversees two 
Thayan apprentices in caring for the imprisoned hatch­
lings, while four Thayan warriors stand guard (see 
appendix B for all three stat blocks). They attack intrud­
ers. In a desperate battle, the Red Wizard might take 
the time to release hatchlings to add to the characters' 
opposition. 
If the battle goes badly for the Thayans, the Red Wiz­
ard surrenders. Her name is Myrja, and her allegiance 
to Szass Tam is less than resolute. If the characters 
spare her, she offers the pass phrase to get by the trap 
and creatures in area 23 ("That which is dead, stay so") 
and one piece of lore. 
Cages. Half the cages here are empty. The others hold 
the following young monsters, which are reduced-threat 
creatures (see "Reduced-Threat Monsters ," page 113): 
Cage A. One remorhaz 
Cage B. Two basilisks 
Cage C. Five darkmantles 
Cage D. Five ettercaps 
Cage E. Two carrion crawlers 
Cage F. One behir (no Constrict or Swallow traits) 
Cage G. Two hook horrors 
Cage H. One wyvern 
Each cage has rune-scribed bars of steel. Transmutation 
magic on the bars renders them unbreakable, so a crea­
ture inside can't physically or magically attack through 
the bars. To free the occupants of a cage, a character 
can pick the lock on the cage door, which requires a suc­
cessful DC 15 Dexterity check . 
If freed from their cages, the young attack the nearest 
creatures. If a Thayan and a character are equally close 
to a young creature, it targets the character. 
Keys. Myrja has a glyph key attuned to this zone. 
She also carries a key to each of the cages in a ring 
on her belt. 
White Gates. Area 22 is bordered by three white 
gates. One connects to the Swine Run, another to the 
Dark Gardens, and a third to the Temples of Despair. 
CHAPTER 5 I DEAD IN THAY 127

128 DARK GARDENS 
Once an area of deadly gardens, these chambers have 
been altered to support the Blood Pens. 
23. DEAD GARDEN 
Dead and blackened thorny vines cover the walls and 
floor, which are peppered with small, circular holes the 
size of a human fist. 
In the northeast corner is a black gate. 
Creatures. Seven zombies and two wights are 
focused on the doors to areas 22 and 24. Those who 
appear by way of the black gate can gain surprise if they 
attack immediately. 
Unless the creatures are attacked, they grant free 
passage to anyone who appears to be a Thayan and 
knows the room's pass phrase (see area 22). The wights 
challenge those who know the phrase but look like 
intruders. It takes a successful DC 15 Charisma (Decep­
tion, Intimidation, or Persuasion) check to convince the 
wights to stand down. 
Aura. A detect magic spell cast on this area reveals an 
aura of transmutation magic around each hole, hinting 
at the presence of a magical effect. 
Blood Vines Trap. If a non-undead creature moves 
10 feet or farther into the room without uttering the 
pass phrase, animated vines shoot out of the holes and 
into every part of the room. Each creature must say the 
phrase; it's not good enough for one character to say it 
for the whole group. 
The vines ignore the undead. Any non-undead crea­
ture in the room when the vines emerge must succeed 
on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or become re­
strained by a vine. A creature takes 11 (2d10) piercing 
damage each time it starts its turn restrained in this 
way. As an action, a restrained creature can free itself 
or another creature with a successful DC 13 Strength 
(Athletics) check, or free only itself with a successful DC 
13 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. A vine that's restraining 
a creature can also be cut and killed; each vine has AC 
15 and 8 hit points. 
While the vines are present, the area is lightly ob­
scured and difficult terrain. A creature takes 2 (ld4) 
piercing damage for every 5 feet it moves through the 
room. A creature that moves more than 15 feet on its 
turn must immediately make a DC 13 Dexterity saving 
throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes restrained 
as described above. 
If no creature is restrained at the end of a round after 
the trap has been triggered, all the vines immediately 
die. The trap then goes dormant for 1 hour. 
Glyph Keys. Each of the wights has a glyph key at­
tuned to this zone. 
White Gate. A white gate is located in the corridor to 
the west between this area and the Hatchery. 
24. PALE GARDEN 
The Red Wizards use this magical garden for food. 
Light. The room is filled with dim light. 
CHAPTER 5 I DEAD IN THAY -e scent of decaying plants hangs over an underground 
ga den. White vines, trembling as if touched by an un-
e t oreeze, twine around cracked pillars that glow with 
oa'e light. Between the pillars, ashen flowers, sickly gray 
s rubs, and giant mushrooms stand in dense groves 
around a couple of gravel paths. 
Many baskets full of plant matter are stacked on 
shelves carved into the walls near the doors. 
Creatures. Twelve unarmed humanoid skeletons 
wander the area, harvesting plant material in large bas­
kets. As they tear off growths, a crackling sound accom­
panies an increase in the glow of a nearby pillar, and the 
harvested plant starts to rapidly regrow. 
The skeletons ignore intruders unless they are at­
tacked or damaged, in which case they all attack tres­
passers in the room. 
Two shambling mounds hide in the groves, ignoring 
the skeletons. These creatures are trained to disregard 
anyone who remains within 15 feet of any doorway, 
where the baskets are stored on the shelves. They wait 
to ambush any non-undead creature that ventures any 
farther into the room. 
Dense Garden. Any area within 5 feet of a pillar 
and not shown on the map as part of the path is diffi­
cult terrain. 
Pillars. The chamber's pillars respond when plant 
matter in the chamber is damaged. At the end of each 
round during which a shambling mound took damage, 
a discharge of energy ripples over the pillars, and each 
creature within 5 feet of a pillar takes 5 (ldlO) light­
ning damage. 
White Gate. The passage that leads west contains a 
white gate that connects with the Temples of Despair. 
25. DREAMING GARDEN 
A garden courtyard fit for a palace features walls of dark 
marble veined with gray. The ceiling of brass is supported 
on black marble pillars. Between the pillars, raised stone 
garden beds are filled with flowers and creeping vines 
in every color of the rainbow, their sweet scent hanging 
in the air. 
Creatures. Thuria, a Red Wizard enchanter (see 
appendix B), lives here and oversees the Blood Pens. 
Two dread warriors (see appendix B) and eight robed 
zombies guard him, and a black dragon wyrmling is 
his personal pet. When the characters first arrive, the 
dragon has just killed a commoner. 
Thuria spends much of his time in seclusion, and 
relishes the opportunity to fight intruders. If reduced 
to 20 hit points or fewer, he surrenders and offers two 
pieces of lore in exchange for his life. He is also willing 
to give up his treasure and share the attunements of 
his glyph key, turning over the actual key only under se­
vere threat. 

--- PAGE 130 ---

Dungeon State. IfThuria survive an m11a encoun­
er with the player characters , he and any: ~ ~ng 
allies go on patrol, attacking any intruder int e 
Doomvault. 
Garden Beds. Enchantment magic imbue- e ;;,arden 
beds. Any living humanoid that spends more than 1 min­
ute here must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom a\;ng throw 
or fall unconscious. The creature can repeat the a\·ing 
hrow at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on 
.t elf on a successful save. On any successfu l a\·e. the 
creature is immune to the effect for 24 hours. The crea-
ures here are already immune to this effect. 
Thuria's Repose. The middle garden bed among the 
three southernmost beds is full of plants shaped like 
pieces of furniture. A circular shrub is a resting couch. 
an angular one is solid enough to use as a desk. and oth­
ers nearby serve as small chairs. 
Contact Stone. On the southern wall near Thuria's 
place of repose is a circle of glowing glyphs that serves 
a a contact stone. 
Treasure. Thuria wears a gold circlet set with rubies 
worth 1,000 gp) and a gold cuff (100 gp). He carries a 
-pell scroll of fly and a potion of greater healing. 
One dread warrior has a +J longsword, and each has a 
gold cuff that matches Thuria's. 
In Thuria's "desk" are mundane records of important 
:·unctions in the Blood Pens. Also within are oil of ethe­
:-ealness and a potion of poison disguised as a potion 
of healing. A bundle of entwined branches opens like a 
coffer to reveal 100 pp and a diamond (worth 1,000 gp). 
Glyph Key. Thuria has a glyph key attuned to this 
zone, the Vermin Halls, the Swine Run, the Hatchery, 
and the Temples of Turmoil (in the Temples of Ex­
·raction sector). 
White Gate. Beyond the exit to the south, a white gate 
.ies in the corridor that leads to the Hall of Necromancy. 
11:ASTERS' DOMAIN 
'!'his sector is the central sanctum of the Red Wizards in 
charge of the Doomvault. 
Locations in the Masters' Domain are identified 
on map 5.5. 
TEMPLES OF DESPAIR 
Although the chambers in this zone are referred to as 
-temples," they are essentially security rooms designed 
·o destroy the unwary. 
Doors. All the doors in this zone are locked. 
Aura. Divine Sense and detect evil and good reveal 
that this zone is thoroughly desecrated. 
26. TEMPLE OF LIGHT 
Glowing pillars brightly light this chamber of white 
marble. Each pillar is carved in the likeness of a sm1 ,ng 
figure with its hands held out, as if ready to accept an 
offering. 
In contrast to the beatific pillars, alcoves around t e 
room contain statues of four-armed gargoyles MAP 5.5: MASTERS' DOMAIN 
Advance Notice. Characters who enter this area feel 
tranquility despite the gargoyles. If a player expresses 
doubt about the impression , that player's character can 
make a DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check. On a successful 
check, the character realizes that the emotion is artifi­
cial and illusory. 
Creatures. When the characters first enter this area, 
the eight four-armed gargoyles are true statues. After 
a door other than a secret door is opened in this area, 
four four-armed gargoyles (as normal gargoyles with 63 
hit points and one extra claw attack, for a total of three 
attacks, with Multiattack) animate and attack. Another 
four-armed gargoyle animates whenever another such 
door is opened. This process continues for as long as 
any gargoyles remain in the alcoves. The gargoyles don't 
leave the room. 
Pillars of Light. Seeming to offer a measure of 
protective power, the pillars have magic designed to 
CHAPTER 5 DEAD IN THAY 
129 

--- PAGE 131 ---

prolong the torment of those trapped here. When a 
creature touches a pillar, the room pulses with light, and 
that creature gains 5 temporary hit points. Any slain 
gargoyle disappears when the light pulses, and a new 
statue appears in an empty alcove. This light pulses 
spontaneously once an hour, replenishing the gargoyles 
even if no one is present. 
Body. Sprawled in front of one alcove, in a location 
where the characters see it only after entering the 
room, is the red-robed form of a male human. Vorja, a 
Red Wizard sent here to face execution, fell to the gar­
goyles but became stabilized after being left for dead. 
It takes healing magic or a successful DC 15 Wisdom 
(Medicine) check to bring him back to consciousness. 
He has only 1 hit point unless healing magic was used. 
Vorja is in no condition to fight, and his loyalty to Thay 
is tenuous. 
If assisted, Vorja can reveal one piece of lore along 
with descriptions of the Hall of Obedience and the Hall 
of NPr.rnm:inr.y. HP knows nothing :iho11t thi.s zonP.. Tf 
he is given a glyph key and taken to the black gate, he 
escapes the Doomvault and joins Syranna 's forces. 
Dungeon State. The nature of this area means the 
gargoyles can't be permanently slain. 
White Gates. A white gate lies in the corridor to the 
north that connects with the Hatchery. Another white 
gate is in the eastern passage between this area and the 
Dark Gardens . 
27. TEMPLE OF SHADOW 
A creature near the doors into this area hears a faint 
moaning that rises in intensity as the creature moves 
closer to the doors. 
A wailing howl erupts from the shadows of this dim 
chamber, echoing from black marble walls. Dark pillars 
rise to the ceiling, each exuding shadow that twists in the 
air like smoke. Alcoves around the room hold statues of 
four-armed gargoyles shrouded in darkness. 
Light. Dim light radiates from the pillars and fills the 
area. Any light source brought into or created in the 
room radiates only dim light unless it is a spell of 3rd 
level or higher. 
Wailing. Pervading the chamber is a horrid wailing 
that has unnerving effects on non-undead creatures 
that hear it. Such creatures have disadvantage on melee 
attack rolls, Strength checks, and Dexterity checks. A 
character can take an action to make a DC 14 Wisdom 
check or Charisma check. On a successful check, the 
character can ignore the effect for 10 minutes. 
Creatures. Shadows swirling around a pillar coalesce 
into a wraith after a door other than a secret door is 
opened in this area. Another wraith emerges from an­
other pillar each round thereafter, until eight undead 
have appeared . The undead don't leave the room. 
PiJJars of Shadow. The pillars here are imbued with 
necromancy magic. An undead creature that touches (or 
passes through) the pillar gains 5 temporary hit points. 
A non-undead creature that touches a pillar takes 5 
CHAPTER 5 I DEAD IN THAY (ldlO) necrotic damage and 5 (ldlO) cold damage. A 
creature can take this damage only once per turn. 
Black Gate. The space beyond the western false door 
contains a black gate. 
Contact Stone. A contact stone is on the wall near the 
black gate. 
28. TEMPLE OF BLOOD 
The coppery scent of blood hangs heavy in the air in 
this chamber of dark red marble. Pools of blood are 
spread across the floor around several dimly glowing red 
pillars that give off wispy vapors. Statues of four-armed 
gargoyles, each with mouths and claws dripping blood, 
stand in alcoves around the chamber. 
Light. Dim, blood-red light radiates from the pillars 
and fills the area. 
Blood. Due to the slick blood on the floor, a creature 
that moves across the ground at greater than half its 
normal speed must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity sav­
ing throw or fall prone. 
Creatures. The vapor swirling around two of the 
pillars coalesces into a pair of vampiric mists (see ap­
pendix B) after a door other than a secret door is opened 
in this area. Another vampiric mist appears whenever 
another such door is opened. This process continues 
until eight of the creatures have manifested . 
PilJars of Blood. If a living humanoid creature 
touches a pillar, the part of its body that touched the 
pillar becomes stuck, and the creature is restrained. At 
the start of each of its turns, the restrained creature is 
drained of blood and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitu­
tion saving throw or take 5 (ldlO) necrotic damage and 
have its hit point maximum reduced by the amount of 
the damage until the creature finishes a long rest. With 
a successful DC 15 Strength check, a creature can use 
an action to escape the pillar's hold, or another creature 
can use an action to pull a victim free. 
White Gates. Two white gates adjoin area 28. One is 
in the south passage that leads to the Hall of Obedience , 
and the other is in the eastern corridor that connects 
with the Hall of Necromancy. 
HALL OF OBEDIENCE 
The Red Wizards use the magic of the Hall of Obedi­
ence to create zealous followers. 
29. CONDITIONING COURT 
Doors surround a central courtyard here, creating the 
sense of a monastic sanctuary. Each of the glowing silver 
pillars that support the ceiling has a set of chains and 
manacles fastened to it. Thayans hang from four of the 
pillars, their seemingly dead eyes open wide as if in a 
state of intense focus. l 

--- PAGE 132 ---

Silver PiJJars. Exuding enchantment ma~· 
·.\·ill and perception, the silver pillars cause an_ c ea-
ure in the courtyard to have disadvanta<' e o _ om 
checks and saving throws. Being chained o he pillar 
causes hypnotic dreams that, after a period o.-wee: or 
months, improve combat skill and imbue mo crearure 
.vith strong devotion to the Red Wizard . 
Four Thayan warriors chained to the pillar are in an 
advanced state of entrancement. They can be treated 
a unconscious. If they are slain, a gong sound in the 
chamber, alerting the inhabitants of the cells. 
Cells. Several of the cells are quarters for Thayans 
,·ho train and work here. Unless otherwise noted. each 
ell contains rough cots and footlockers that hold worth­
less personal possessions. 
Any commotion in the area, or the sounding of the 
~ong, alerts those in the cells. The Red Wizard emerges 
• round later, and the Thayan apprentice comes out 
during the following round. The residents of the other 
ells take ld4 + 1 rounds to respond (roll separately 
for each). 
The occupants of the cells are as follows: 
Cell A. A Red Wizard illusionist dwells in this fine 
chamber with one Thayan apprentice (see appendix 
B for both stat blocks). The wizard is half asleep. Both 
have glyph keys attuned to the zone, as well as keys to 
the C cells. In combat, the apprentice uses an action 
to open the occupied C cell if able to do so without 
significant risk. 
Cell B. Two Thayan warriors (see appendix B) sleep in 
each of four small rooms. The B cells marked with an 
asterisk are empty. 
Cell C. The doors to these two cells are locked. Four 
Thayan warriors (see appendix B) are held in one of 
them when it's not their turn to be shackled to the sil­
ver pillars. The other C cell is empty. 
Cell D. This cell contains bunks but is empty. 
Black Gate. The space beyond the secret door in the 
-outheast corner contains a black gate. 
White Gates. The corridors that exit this area to the 
north and the east have white gates that connect with 
the Temples of Despair and the Hall of Necromancy. 
30. TRAINING FLOOR 
An arsenal of weapons and armor hangs from the walls 
n this broad chamber, the floor of which is stained with 
blood and black ichor. On the wall between two weapon 
racks to the east is a contact stone. 
Creatures. Lahnis, a Red Wizard evoker (see ap­
pendix B), directs the brutal combat training here. Six 
Thayan warriors engage a dread warrior (see appen­
dix B for both stat blocks) and seven skeletons. Lahnis 
orders the whole lot to attack intruders . Because they 
have been engaged in combat, each creature aside from 
Lahnis starts with current hit points equal to half its hit 
point maximum. 
Lahnis initially stays back in combat. u ing lower-level 
pells and trying to assess the character · motivations. LAHN IS, RED Wi"IARO 
His allegiance to Szass Tam has been flagging. He leans 
toward supporting the Thayan rebels, but he has not 
formally joined their ranks. He worries that some of his 
peers who are loyal to Szass Tam might suspect him. 
Aware of Szass Tam's cunning, Lahnis first assumes 
the characters are testing his allegiance. Around the 
second round of combat, or if reduced to half his hit 
points or fewer, Lahnis directly asks the characters their 
purpose and admits a willingness to join the rebels. The 
characters can sway him with convincing talk and proof 
that they have overcome other parts of the dungeon. 
If the characters earn his trust, Lahnis turns against 
Szass Tam, having become convinced that the regent's 
plots will be the undoing of Thay. 
He then turns on the Thayans here, whom he knows 
won't stand down, and helps the characters fight. After­
ward, Lahnis provides two pieces of lore and the attune­
ments on his glyph key, as well as his physical keys. He 
goes to the gatehouse through the black gate in area 29. 
Treasure. Among the weapons here are a +l bat­
tleaxe, a +l greatsword, and a +1 shortbow. A heavily 
scarred suit of plate armor here is armor of vulnerability 
(your choice of type). In addition, Lahnis wears a ring of 
protection. 
Keys. Lahnis carries a glyph key attuned to this zone, 
the Hall of Necromancy, and the Temples of Despair. He 
also carries a key that safely opens all the doors in the 
Temples of Despair, as well as a key to open the C cells 
in area 29. 
Development. If Lahn is joins the rebels, he pro­
vides information that decreases the Doomvault's alert 
level by 1. 
CHAPTER 5 DEAD 11' THAY 

--- PAGE 133 ---

PHAIA, Reo Wn.ARD NECROMANCER 
HALL OF NECROMANCY 
Red Wizards practice and refine their darkest magic in 
the Hall of Necromancy. 
31. UNDYING LABORATORY 
If Phaia and Kelson are here (see "Creatures" below), 
anyone who listens at the doors can hear screaming 
coming from the other side. 
The walls of this black marble mausoleum are lined with 
hundreds of niches, each holding an ivory urn set with 
gold, silver, and precious gems. A dozen gray marble 
tables arrayed across the floor are encrusted with blood 
and ichor. 
In the north side of the room is a black gate. 
Creatures. Phaia, a Red Wizard necromancer (see 
appendix B), is drawing the soul from Kelson Dark­
treader, a male half-elf lying on a stone table farthest 
from the door the characters use to enter. Kelson is 
unconscious and stable at O hit points. Phaia's magic is 
drawing forth from his body a wispy shape that resem­
bles him, and this shape screams in an echoing voice. 
Strands of energy flow from the shape into the table and 
from there into other forms in the room. 
A deathlock wight (see appendix B) on a nearby ta­
ble is a Red Wizard in the process of being raised as 
undead. Also nearby, two reduced-threat wights (see 
CHAPTER 5 I DEAD IN THAY -Reduced-Threat Monsters," page 113) are being 
rai d as warrior undead. These wights are only par­
ially animated, so they respond only to Phaia when she 
order an attack. One of them tries to throw an urn at 
a character each round (+4 to hit, range 10 feet/20 feet; 
one creature). A hit deals 3 (ld6) bludgeoning damage, 
and the target must make saving throws as noted in the 
-urns-section. Phaia stays for a round or two to assess 
the party's capabilities and then moves to area 32 or 
u e the black gate in the room. 
As a faithful servant of Szass Tam, Phaia follows the 
lich lord's philosophy that no magic is too dangerous 
and no experiment too dark if it promises power. Lawful 
evil, Phaia is as opportunistic as she is wicked. 
She does anything she can to save herself from death, 
including using Szass Tam's secrets. She can reveal 
two pieces of lore and is willing to share her glyph key's 
attunements. Further, she can teach the characters the 
ritual that uses this area's magic to return soul-bound 
undead characters to life. 
If she is allowed to do so, Phaia flees the Doomvault. 
Aura. A detect magic spell reveals an aura of nec­
romancy on the whole area, signifying the magic that 
helps in the creation of undead. Divine Sense and detect 
evil and good reveal that this area is desecrated. 
Stone Tables. These 3-foot-high carved slabs channel 
the energy of life and undeath. They aid in rituals and 
spells to create undead. 
With the proper knowledge, a creature can use the 
stone tables to transform a soul-bound character back 
into a normal creature. Doing so requires the aid of a 
Red Wizard or explicit written instruction, such as the 
scroll in Lahnis's room in area 32. The ritual takes 20 
minutes and requires a spellcaster to make a DC 15 
Intelligence (Arcana) check. The spellcaster must also 
expend a 3rd-level spell slot. On a successful check, the 
soul-bound creature returns to normal with all of its Hit 
Dice expended. On a failed check, the spell slot is ex­
pended but the creature remains soul bound. 
Urns. The urns are magic and worthless but clever 
fakes that appear valuable, requiring a successful DC 20 
Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern the truth. 
Any non-undead creature that touches an urn must suc­
ceed on a DC 17 Constitution or Wisdom saving throw 
(creature's choice) or take 10 (3d6) necrotic damage and 
become paralyzed for 1 minute. The creature can repeat 
the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending 
the effect on itself on a successful save. If this damage 
reduces a creature to O hit points, the creature dies and 
turns to dust. 
Kelson. Despite his ordeal, Kelson Darktreader can 
be restored to health through normal means, although 
he is in no condition to help. He thanks the characters 
for saving him and offers two pieces of lore. He asks for 
a glyph key and goes to the gatehouse to recuperate. 
Treasure. Phaia carries a +l dagger, a spell scroll of 
darkvision, and a potion of water breathing. 
Glyph Key. Phaia has a glyph key attuned to this zone 
and the Temples of Oppression (in the Temples of Ex­
traction sector). 
White Gates. The corridor that leads west has a white 
gate that connects with the Temples of Despair. In the 

--- PAGE 134 ---

northern leg of the corridor to the east 1s a 
gate that leads to the Dark Gardens . 
32. WIZARDS ' COURT 
A stepped monument of gray marble shot 
red dominates an open courtyard surroundea D c osec 
doors. Blue light shines from the top of the mon er:t. 
The air around it hums with power, its vibration o er­
whelming other sensations. Red Wizards and other 
Thayans kneel on the lower two tiers, eyes fixed on the 
monument. He 
Stepped Monument. The monument amplifies magic 
· n the courtyard, but those in the area have trouble with 
physical sensations and tasks, and they have disad­
;antage on Strength and Dexterity checks and saving 
·hrows. Meditating on the monument causes hypnotic 
dreams that, after a period of weeks or months, improve 
spellcasting capabilities and imbue most creatures with 
strong devotion to the Red Wizards. 
Each tier of the monument is 5 feet high, and clamber­
ng onto it requires 5 extra feet of movement. 
Creatures. Three Thayan apprentices (see appendix 
B) kneel on the lower tier of the monument. The Thay­
ans attack intruders. 
CeJJs. The cells around the perimeter of the court 
rooms labeled A through D on the map) are quarters 
·or Thayans who train and work here. Unless otherwise 
noted, each cell contains rough cots and footlockers 
olding worthless personal possessions. Cells marked 
~·ith an asterisk on the map are empty. 
Combat in the courtyard alerts the inhabitants of 
'he cells. They take ld4 + 1 rounds to respond (roll for 
each one): 
Cell A. Lahnis (see area 30) uses these quarters, which 
contain a fine bed, a footlocker , and a desk. Searching 
the area uncovers one written piece of lore, as well 
as a tome of the stilled tongue and six spell scrolls 
(two each of detect magic, identify, and remove curse). 
Lahnis also has a scroll describing the ritual used to 
turn soul-bound undead back into non-undead crea­
tures in area 31. 
Cell B. One Red Wizard evoker (see appendix B) 
sleeps here. 
Cell C. One Thayan apprentice (see appendix B) 
sleeps here. 
Cell D. Each of these two rooms is a library. An hour 
spent examining a library's contents turns up two 
pieces of lore. 
Contact Stone. Atop the monument is a circle of glow­
ing glyphs that serves as a contact stone. 
Glyph Key. The Red Wizard in cell B has a glyph key 
attuned to this zone. 
White Gates. Two white gates separate area 32 from 
other zones. The gate in the corridor to the west leads to 
the Hall of Obedience. Beyond the doors to the outh is 
a gate that connects with the Dread Legion Outpo t. KELSON 0ARKTREADER 
DREAD LEGION OUTPOST 
The Dread Legion, Thay's army, maintains a full com­
pany in the Doomvault. 
33. CAVERN GUARD POST 
l Glowing crystals set into the walls and floors light a ] 
rough stone cavern. To the south is a black gate. 
Blue Crystals. The blue crystals brightly 
light the area. 
Creatures. One Thayan warrior (see appendix B), 
five gnolls, and five ores attack intruders on sight. 
Glyph Key. The Thayan warrior has a glyph key at­
tuned to this zone. 
34. SHARD CAVERN 
This cavern has no light. 
The walls and ceiling of this rough cavern are a mass of 
rock spines, the floor covered with rock dust and shards. 
A path has been worn through the rubble, winding be­
tween double doors to the west and a rough flight of 
stairs rising to the larger and lit open space to the east. 
CHAPTER r. I 9EA.D IN THAY 
133 

--- PAGE 135 ---

134 Path. Except on the path, the ground in the room is 
difficult terrain. 
Shard Storm Trap. Transmutation magic infuses the 
room. Any creature that spends more than 1 round in 
this area triggers the trap. When the trap triggers, each 
creature in the room who isn't wearing a Thayan uni­
form must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 
14 (4d6) piercing damage from flying shards on a failed 
save, or only half as much damage on a successful one. 
This effect repeats every round until the room is empty, 
when the trap resets. 
The path becomes difficult terrain, and if the crea­
tures in areas 33 and 35 can hear the trap go off, the 
guards have warning that intruders are in the area. 
Stone Wall. A rough stone wall separates the lower 
cavern of area 34 from the higher finished chamber of 
area 35. The wall is 15 feet high. 
35. DREAD LEGION BARRACKS 
The light in this room can be seen from area 34. Unless 
the creatures here have a reason to be quiet, they are 
talking loudly. 
Three bonfires light this vast chamber, their smoke rising 
to vent through cracks in the ceiling. Scattered bedding 
and the stench of unwashed humanoids suggest that 
many creatures might dwell here. 
In the east, on the wall between two oversized bed­
rolls, is a contact stone. 
Bonfires. Large fires brightly light this area. A crea­
ture that enters a bonfire for the first time on a turn, or 
starts its turn in a fire, takes 3 (ld6) fire damage. 
Creatures. Resting in this chamber are a Thayan 
warrior (see appendix B) and a Dread Legion squad 
made up of five ores and five gnolls. A troll is on post 
here to keep the other legionnaires in line. 
Stone Wall. See area 34. 
Dungeon State. The Dread Legion patrols through­
out the Doomvault. If a squad resting in the barracks is 
slain, an identical squad arrives here within 1 hour. 
Glyph Keys. The Thayan warrior has a glyph key at­
tuned to every zone in this sector. The troll has a glyph 
key attuned to this zone. 
White Gates. A white gate is located in the corridor to 
the south, leading to the Warren of Eyes. Another white 
gate is in the passage to the north that connects with the 
Hall of Necromancy. 
FAR REALM CYSTS 
The influence of the Far Realm has warped a portion 
of the Doomvault, where several star-shaped chambers 
have been turned into a weird mix of worked stone and 
glistening walls. Unless otherwise noted, these cav­
erns are dark. 
Locations in the Far Realm Cysts are identified 
on map 5.6. 
CHAPTER 5 I DEAD IN THAY LAKE OF MADNESS 
.-\n aboleth dwells in a watery crevasse, seething at its 
imprisonment and hungry to enslave the living. 
36. DARK WATER 
Water can be heard rippling in this dark area before the 
characters arrive. 
The walls of this cavern are the same dark shade of 
blue as the pool of water that fills the center of the area. 
Ripples spread across the surface as if the water has 
been recently disturbed . Around the cavern, narrow al­
coves hold enormous globes of blue liquid suspended 
in the air. 
In the west side of the room is a black gate, and on the 
wall near it is a contact stone. 
Creatures. One reduced-threat aboleth (see "Re­
duced-Threat Monsters," page 113) dwells deep in the 
pool. Within this room, the aboleth can use the water 
globes (see "Water Globes" below) to move around. 
The aboleth's ordeal in the Doomvault has weakened 
it, making it a reduced threat. In addition, its hatred 
of the Red Wizards makes the aboleth a potential ally. 
With a successful DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) check, 
or another successful and appropriate check, a charac­
ter can convince the aboleth to stand down and negoti­
ate. In exchange for sparing the characters, the aboleth 
demands to be freed and given a glyph key. 
Pool. Over 350 feet deep, this pool has sheer sides 
that drop to its bottom. The water within 10 feet of the 
surface is a lightly obscured area, and deeper water is 
heavily obscured. 1 
Water Globes. Floating 5 feet above the floor, these 
magic water globes are 15 feet in diameter. Red Wizards 
use them to hold aquatic creatures for transport through 
the black gates. 
As an action, a creature that is within 5 feet of a 
globe and has an Intelligence score of 10 or higher can 
take control of the globe by succeeding on a DC 10 
Intelligence check. As part of its movement and with a 
successful DC 10 Intelligence check, the controller can 
direct the globe to move with it, remaining within 5 feet 
of the controller. A globe's controller can enter and leave 
the globe at will. The controller can maintain control of 
the globe while within 100 feet of it. Another creature 
that qualifies as a controller can gain control of a globe 
by winning a contest of Intelligence checks against the 
current controller. 
A creature that touches a globe but isn't its controller 
must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be 
drawn into the globe and unable to pass back through 
its boundary. As an action, a trapped creature can free 
itself with a successful DC 15 Intelligence check. Also 
as an action, a globe's controller can release a trapped 
creature with a successful DC 10 Intelligence check. 
A creature inside a globe has half cover against effects 
that originate outside the globe. While inside a globe, a 
trapped creature can't contest for control of the globe.

White Gate. A white gate lies in the ea -
dor between this area and the Warren of E_ es. 
37. COMPELLING LIGHT 
Light. The dim light that fills the chamber can be een 
before the room can . 
• 
• Dim light dances in the air, shimmering through t ecol­
ors of the rainbow, gently lighting the walls of th s ca ern. 
A few piles of bones and scraps of gear litter the floor . 
Creatures. The shimmering light here has affected 
two wights, two dread warriors (see appendix B), 
and six zombies. They attack if the trap's effect on 
them ends. 
CompeJJing Light Trap. Any creature that sees the 
magical light while within this area must succeed on 
a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or enter the cavern and 
rand there while ignoring all other stimuli. When an 
affected creature takes damage, the creature can repeat 
he saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a suc­
cessful save. Any non-undead creature that ends its turn 
in the lighted room takes 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. 
A dispel magic spell suppresses the light's effect for 10 
minutes. Any spell that overwhelms or blocks the light 
also suppresses it in the spell's area for the duration of 
he spell. 
Glyph Key. One of the dread warriors has a glyph key 
attuned to the Forest of Death. 
White Gate. A white gate lies at the foot of the stairs 
leading west toward the Forest of Death. 
\VARREN OF EYES 
Thaxalia, a beholder, has been summoned and im­
prisoned here. 
Light. This zone is bathed in a weird green glow that 
provides dim illumination. 
38. SINKHOLE CAVERN 
This rough cavern has an uneven floor with open holes in 
·t. In the east, on a spar of rock, is a contact stone. I 
If the characters come from the north, add the following. 
Southwest of the doors is an alcove that contains a 
black gate. 
Creatures. Eight zombies and two ogre zombies 
attack any intruders. Any combat warns Thaxalia (area 
39) of the approach of intruders. 
Sinkholes. These open sinkholes are 5 feet across 
and 10 feet deep. A creature that falls into a sinkhole is 
restrained in the narrow bottom. It takes a successful 
DC 13 Strength check or Dexterity check to work free, I MAP 5.G: FAR REALM CYSTS 
and a Small creature has advantage on this check. It's 
then an easy matter to climb out of the sinkhole. 
White Gate. The passage that leads west has a white 
gate that connects with the Lake of Madness. 
39. BEHOLDER 'S DOMAIN 
Hundreds of unblinking eyes stare into this room from 
long walls of glistening green stone. The floor of this 
chamber is covered with viscous slime that drips from 
four stalagmites. 
Beholder. Thaxalia, a reduced-threat beholder (see 
"Reduced-Threat Monsters," page 113) crippled by 
Thayan magic, floats near the ceiling, trying to remain 
unnoticed while intruders enter. Thaxalia's central eye 
and two of its eyestalks have been maimed by the Red 
CHAPTER 5 DEAD IN THAY 
135 

--- PAGE 137 ---

Wizards, rendering those eye rays (death ray and disin­
tegration) powerless. If it has warning or is reduced to 
50 hit points or fewer, it withdraws to area 40, leaving 
its spawn to deal with the threat. 
After only 2 rounds, Thaxalia's hatred for the Red 
Wizards inspires the beholder to question the charac­
ters' purpose in the dungeon. If they reveal their goals, 
the beholder suggests an alliance, extolling its plans 
for revenge. 
Fearing Thaxalia's ability to wreak havoc if it escapes 
this zone, the Red Wizards cursed the beholder with 
the inability to use glyph keys. Thaxalia doesn't know 
the solution, but a remove curse spell can eliminate the 
prohibition. The beholder then takes a glyph key from 
the wight in area 40 and asks the characters to provide 
it with more attunements. If refused, it becomes hostile 
and uses its powers to compel the characters to give it 
more attunements. 
Beholder Spawn. Clinging to the cavern walls by the

the manifestations of beholder spawn. These spawn 
aren't independent creatures, but they can project weak 
eye rays that function as an area hazard. At the start of 
each of its turns, any creature other than Thaxalia in the 
cavern must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw 
or suffer one of the following effects, rolled randomly. 
2d4 Eye Ray 
2-3 Charm. For its turn, the target moves toward its near­
est ally and attacks with a weapon or a cantrip. The 
target can't check for danger as it moves. 
4-5 Telekinesis. The target is pushed 5 feet in a random 
direction and falls prone. 
6-7 Slow. Until the start of its next turn, the target's 
speed is reduced by 15 feet, and others make attack 
rolls against the target with advantage. 
8 Sleep. The target falls unconscious until the start of 
its next turn. 
Slime. Covering the rough floor is 1 foot of thick 
slime, which is difficult terrain and covers several hid­
den sinkholes. Any creature that starts its turn prone in 
or submerged in the slime takes 4 (ld8) poison damage. 
Sinkholes. These open sinkholes are 5 feet across 
and 10 feet deep, and they are filled with slime. While 
moving near a sinkhole , a character who succeeds on a 
DC 20 Perception check notices the hazard due to the 
flow of slime in and around it. A creature that falls into 
a sinkhole is restrained in the narrow bottom and sub­
merged in slime, unable to breathe. It takes a successful 
DC 15 Strength check or Dexterity check to work free, 
and a Small creature has advantage on this check. It 
then takes a successful DC 10 Strength check to climb 
out of the sinkhole. 
Stalagmites. These 10-foot-diameter spires of 
rock rise 20 feet above the floor and exude the other­
worldly slime. Their sides are slick and smooth, diffi­
cult to climb. 
Dungeon State. If freed and given a glyph key, 
Thaxalia allows the characters free passage through 
this area. While Thaxalia is free in the Doomvault, it 
CHAPTER 5 I DEAD IN THAY pre -ers to attack Thayans. If encountered again, the be­
holder might help the characters, given incentives. 
The beholder spawn in this area are no longer a threat 
to those who freed Thaxalia. If Thaxalia is destroyed, 
the beholder spawn here disappear. 
-!O. SLIME SLAVES 
Viscous slime covers this chamber. Rough stone steps 
lead up and out. 
If Thaxalia left area 39, the beholder is in this loca­
tion. It has been picking off Thayan patrols here. Amid 
the slime are five bodies: two of wights and three of 
Thayan warriors. 
Slime. Covering the rough floor is 1 foot of thick 
slime. Any creature that starts its turn prone in the 
slime takes 4 (ld8) poison damage. 
Giyph Key. One wight corpse has a giyph key attuned 
to this zone. 
White Gate. A white gate lies in the corridor to the 
west, leading into the Prison of Filth. 
PRISON OF FILTH 
A pack of otyughs has been imprisoned here to repro­
duce in the filth. 
Light. None. 
Necrotic Essence. Viewed with detect magic, the 
area has an aura of necromancy . When non-undead 
creatures regain hit points in this zone, they regain only 
half as many. 
41. GARBAGE TRANSFER 
This rough-walled cavern contains nothing that should 
make it stink of filth and rot as it does. 
Shadows curl like smoke from the walls. To the north­
east, similar shadows whirl around a black gate. East of it 
is a contact stone. 
Creatures. Twenty unarmed skeletons stand here, 
waiting to cart refuse that arrives from other areas 
through the black gate. They attack only if attacked. 
If a character drops any moderate-sized object in 
front of the skeletons, as many of them as needed 
quickly seize the object and carry it into area 42. 
The otyughs are distracted while the skeletons move 
through area 42. 
Doors. Abjuration magic on these locked doors 
causes them to open if an animate skeleton 
touches them. 
Dungeon State. Unless destroyed with radiant dam­
age, the skeletons here reassemble within 1 minute of 
being destroyed. Restored skeletons have no memory of 
their previous fate, so they attack only if attacked or if 
they witness other skeletons under attack. 

--- PAGE 138 ---

42. 0TYUGH LAIR 
• 
• Pools and piles of rotting garbage, offal, a"C = 
the rough stone floor of this cavern. The a·r s 
an unbearable stench. Four stalagmites t 
the floor. 
Creatures. Two otyughs and two reduced-threat 
otyugh young (see "Reduced-Threat Monsters ... page 
113) hide in the trash here. The reduced-threat mon-
ters can't restrain with tentacles or use Tentacle Slam. 
The otyughs attack right away unless the otyugh from 
area 20 is here, in which case it may convince them to 
delay or even negotiate with the characters (depending 
on how the previous encounter went). 
The otyughs use their telepathy to demand food like 
peevish children. If the characters offer to feed them, 
he otyughs stop fighting to see if the party is telling the 
ruth (unless the party has slain one of the young). If the 
haracters have killed one of the young, it takes a suc-
cessful DC 20 Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) 
check to get the otyughs to stand down. 
Stench. At the start of each of its turns in this area, 
any non-undead creature that isn't an otyugh must suc-
eed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be over­
powered by the stench. On a failed save, a creature is 
poisoned until the start of its next turn. On a successful 
-ave, the creature is immune to this stench for 1 hour. 
Trash. The waste in the area is difficult terrain. 
Stalagmites. These IO-foot-diameter spires of rock 
rise 20 feet above the floor. 
Dungeon State. If the otyughs are freed and given a 
glyph key, they go rampaging through the dungeon , de­
·.·ouring anything in their path, including Red Wizards. 
White Gates. The open passages that lead away from 
area 42 both contain white gates. The northern route 
leads to the Warren of Eyes, and the southern path goes 
o the Caverns of Chaos. 
-l-3. SUMMONING CHAMBER 
• 
A blood-red circle is scribed on the floor of this cavern, 
the twisted runes around its edge pulsing with sickly 
purple light. 
.-\ successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check al-
_ows a character to recognize the runes as symbols of 
dangerous magic that can be manipulated to call forth 
creatures of the Far Realm. The character further 
·nows that using the summoning circle is impossible 
without the proper rituals, and that it can be disabled by 
defacing particular runes. The character is also aware 
•hat the process could unleash weird forces. Defacing 
·he runes requires the use of a weapon or tools. such as 
hieves' tools, and a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Ar-
cana) check. 
Each time a character tries to disable the circle and 
fails, the circle unleashes a pulse of magical power that 
~orces each creature in the area to succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or suffer a severe break with 
reality. On a failed save, a creature has disadvantage on 
all Intelligence checks, Wisdom checks, and Charisma 
checks. In addition, the creature has disadvantage when 
rolling initiative and can't maintain concentration. Re­
move curse, greater restoration, or equivalent magic 
restores the creature to normal, as does finishing a 
long rest. 
White Gate. A white gate stands in the passage that 
leads to the Forest of Weakness. 
CAVERNS OF CHAOS 
The creatures and forces of the Far Realm are held in 
these unlit caverns. 
44. CHAOS LAIR 
Twisting ledges divide this chamber into multiple sec­
tions, creating a series of increasingly deep tiers. Stalag­
mites dot the floor. 
Advance Notice. Those entering this area can hear 
the babble of the gibbering mouthers. A successful DC 
10 Intelligence check confirms that the speech is gibber­
ish in various languages. 
Ceiling. Although the cavern floor steps down to the 
east as shown on the map, the ceiling stays level. 
Creatures. Four gricks climb and wander on the 
top two steps, while two gibbering mouthers lurk on 
the third. One grell starts out flying above area 45. Six 
prisoners hide among the ledges, trying to avoid the ab­
errant monsters. 
Aberrant Magic Field. Weird transmutation magic 
radiates from the entire cavern. Whenever a character 
gets a failure on an attack roll, a saving throw, or a 
check in this area, all the character's ongoing spells and 
magic items are suppressed until the end of the charac­
ter's next turn. During this time, spells provide no effect 
and items don't impart their properties or powers. 
Ledges. Each rough ledge is 10 feet high and 
easy to scale . 
Stalagmites. These IO-foot-diameter spires of rock 
rise 20 feet above the floor. 
Black Gate. A black gate is set into the western al­
cove, not immediately visible from the entrance. 
White Gate. The exit from this area contains a white 
gate that connects with the Prison of Filth . 
45. ELDRITCH ALTAR 
A slab of jet-black stone sits at the center of this cavern 
alcove. Its sides show relief carvings of familiar human­
oid faces-your own. 
On the wall east of the altar is a contact stone. 
Altar. This ancient altar to chaos is imbued with 
transmutation magic that reshapes its sides to show 
the faces of the most recent sentient humanoids to en­
ter area 44. 
CHAPTER 5 I DEAD IN THAY 137 

--- PAGE 139 ---

The top of the altar slab shows the shadowy outlines 
of a dozen weapons, pendants , and other objects. An 
identify spell reveals that the altar imparts additional 
power into magic items placed on its surface. The caster 
must succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check 
to further discern that when an item is empowered, the 
altar also draws in the life force of creatures near it. 
When any magic item is placed on the altar for 1 min­
ute, it takes on the following features: 
The item glows with dim purple light out to a radius 
of 5 feet. 
, The item periodically and randomly alters its appear­
ance in slight ways. The bearer has no control over 
these minor transformations, which don't affect the 
item's use or magical properties . 
• The owner can communicate telepathically with the 
creature whose soul was consumed (see below). 
When a magic item is transformed , randomly select 
one character within 50 feet of the altar. That person's 
soul is drawn into the item, and he or she drops into a 
deathlike coma, requiring a successful DC 15 Wisdom 
(Medicine) check to realize that the victim is still alive. 
An identify spell can be used to discern the whereabouts 
of the soul and how to cure the condition, temporarily or 
permanently. 
Placing the transformed magic item in the victim's 
hand temporarily ends the coma. Thereafter, the char­
acter must continue to hold the object in hand or fall 
into a coma again. If the character breaks contact with 
the object for 1 hour, or if the object is destroyed, the 
character dies. Remove curse, greater restoration, or 
equivalent magic breaks the bond, returning the soul to 
its rightful place. 
FORESTS OF SLAUGHTER 
These caverns house a Thayan menagerie. 
Locations in the Forests of Slaughter are identified 
on map 5.7. 
Light. The cavern ceilings glow with magical light that 
varies in 12-hour cycles to simulate day and night. When 
the characters arrive, it is the start of the night cycle, 
and all areas of this sector are in dim light. 
Magic Trees. Isolated stands of gnarled and vine­
choked trees rise 15 to 20 feet high in the caverns. 
The trees are magic, having different powers in each 
zone, and targeting any intruders -creatures that aren't 
normally housed in the area. An area of trees is diffi­
cult terrain. 
Magic Turf. The rocky cavern floors in this sector are 
covered in a layer of magic turf that uses transmutation 
magic to slowly absorb the waste of the creatures that 
dwell here. 
Pools. Each of the rocky pools in these caverns is 1 
foot deep and magically filled with cool , clean water. A 
pool is difficult terrain. 
CHAPTER 5 I DEAD IN THAY FOREST OF ILLUSION 
Powerful illusion magic suffuses the trees in this zone. 
\\.hen an intruder ends its turn in an area of trees, the 
creature must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On 
a failed save, the creature becomes unable for 1 minute 
to see creatures hostile to itself. The creature repeats 
the sa\'ing throw at the end of each of its turns, ending 
the effect on itself on a successful save. 
46. HOOK HORROR NEST 
I The turf here is full of deep, enormous gouges. 
Advance Warning. A character who succeeds on a 
DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check can identify the gouges 
and tracks in the area as belonging to Large bipedal 
predators that use oversized clawed forelimbs to move 
like a gorilla might. A character who succeeds on a DC 
15 Intelligence (Nature) check recognizes the traits of 
hook horrors. 
Creatures. Four hook horrors hang from the walls 
here. They have grown lazy and distracted by their 
imprisonment, so characters have advantage on Dex­
terity (Stealth) checks made against the horrors until 
any character is spotted. The horrors hesitate to attack 
those dressed like Thayans but do so if no food is 
quickly offered. 
The horrors fight mostly to defend a mound in the 
northwest section of the cavern, which contains their 
eggs. A character who can speak Undercommon and 
deal with the hook horrors' unsophisticated intellect can 
get them to stand down by guaranteeing the eggs' safety 
and making a successful DC 20 Charisma (Deception, 
Intimidation, or Persuasion) check. If the check fails, the 
horrors try to kill and eat the interlopers, but the negoti­
ations can be renewed if two or more horrors are slain. 
Black Gate. A black gate is set into the northeast­
ern edge of the area, not immediately visible from 
the entrance. 
Contact Stone. A contact stone is on the wall just 
north of the black gate. 
Dungeon State. The hook horrors recognize a truce 
for only about 10 minutes. At that point, intruders have 
to renegotiate. 
White Gate. The passage to the northeast contains a 
white gate that offers access to the Immortal Caverns. 
47. COCKATRICE ROOST 
I This treeless section of the cavern is set with natural I 
ledges and indentations ten feet from the floor. 
Creatures. Eight cockatrices roost on the ledges. 
They make no attempt to hide, and they attack as soon 
as they realize the characters have no food for them. 
Ledges. Rough handholds make it easy to climb the 
walls in this area. A search of the ledges reveals sixteen 
cockatrice eggs. 

--- PAGE 140 ---

MAI' 5.7: FORESTS OF SLAUGHTER 
-1-8. GORGON LAIR 
At the pool's edge is a lifelike statue of a hook horror. I 
Creatures. Two adult gorgons attack intruders on 
-ight, pursuing those who flee into area 46. Any hook 
horrors there attack only if the intruders slay or drive off 
the gorgons. 
White Gate. A white gate is situated in the opening in 
the rock wall that leads to the Forest of Recovery. 
FOREST OF RECOVERY 
Powerful conjuration magic suffuses the trees in this 
zone. When an intruder ends its turn in an area of trees, 
the creature must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. 
On a failed save, any damage the creature deals for 1 
minute instead causes the target to gain 5 (ldlO) tem­
porary hit points per successful attack. The creature 
repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, 
ending the effect on itself on a successful save. 
49. GATE CAVERN 
' Trees crowd the walls of this turfed cavern. To the south­
west the turf gives way to a stone floor, where shadows 
curl up like smoke from a black gate. West of e gate ,s a 
contact stone. Creatures. A helmed horror and a wight guard this 
area. The wight has orders to confront anyone who 
comes through the gate without pig carcasses or other 
items to feed to the zone's monsters. If such interlopers 
can't provide credible reasons for their presence , the 
wight orders the helmed horror to attack. 
Glyph Key. The wight has a glyph key attuned to 
this zone. 
50. BARGHEST RANGE 
I The grassy turf grows high in this large cavern. 
Creatures. Two barghests (see appendix B) lurk in 
the tall grass. A character who succeeds on a DC 20 
Wisdom (Perception) check spots one or more of them. 
These creatures hesitate to attack only if the characters 
seem to be Thayans. I 
The barghests want to take revenge on the Red Wiz­
ards and then escape the Doomvault. If the characters 
offer to free them and succeed on a DC 20 Charisma 
check (any appropriate Charisma skill can apply), the 
fiends stand down. They want any glyph keys the char­
acters have. If they are defied, the barghests are likely to 
renew their attacks. 
Development. If the barghests are freed and given 
a glyph key, they stalk the dungeon for any prey 
they can find. 
White Gate. A white gate is located in the opening in 
the rock wall that leads to the Forest of Illusion. 
CHAPTER<; I DEAD IN THAY 139

51. POOL OF RECOVERY 
I A pool in this cavern glows with pale blue light. I 
The pool's magic grants non-undead creatures that 
drink from it the benefits of finishing a short rest. A 
creature can drink from the pool safely only once per 
tenday. The second time the creature drinks in a tenday, 
its hit point maximum is halved for one tenday (remove 
curse negates this effect). The third time the creature 
drinks in a tenday, it suffers the effects of a harm spell 
(save DC 15). 
It isn't safe for an undead to drink from the pool. If the 
undead does, it gains no benefits and takes 22 (4d10) 
radiant damage. 
White Gate. A white gate stands in the opening in the 
wall between this area and the Forest of Weakness . 
I Bones are piled against the western walls of this cavern, I 
forming low mounds . 
Creatures. Two adult displacer beasts dwell here 
with three reduced-threat displacer beasts (see "Re­
duced-Threat Monsters ," page 113). Each creature 
sits atop a different bone mound, and they all attack 
when it becomes clear that the characters have not 
brought food. 
Bone Piles. These 1-foot-high piles of bones are diffi­
cult terrain. 
White Gates. The northern exit from this area has 
a white gate that connects with the Culling Pens. The 
opening to the east has a white gate that leads to the 
Forest of Death. 
FOREST OF DEATH 
Powerful necromancy magic suffuses the trees in this 
zone. When an intruder ends its turn in an area of trees, 
the creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving 
throw. On a failed save, the creature can't regain hit 
points for 10 minutes. 
53. PERYTON ROOST 
I Broad ledges run along the walls of this long cavern, 
twenty feet above the floor. I 
Creatures. The four adult perytons and four 
reduced-threat perytons (see "Reduced-Threat Mon­
sters," page 113) that roost here have grown tired of 
their pork diet. If the characters don't appear to be Thay­
ans, or if they fail to offer food within a few moments , 
the perytons attack. 
CHAPTER 5 I DEAD IN THAY Ledges. Rough handholds make it easy to climb the 
wa'.l in this area. A search of the ledges reveals five 
peryton eggs. 
Hrute Gates. The southern passage has a white gate 
that leads to the Forest of Recovery. To the northwest, a 
white gate connects with the Culling Pens. 
54. TROLL CAVERN 
Broken and gnawed bones are strewn across the turf 
in this forested cavern. Against the eastern ledge is a 
black gate. On the wall southwest of the gate is a con­
tact stone. 
• 
Creatures. Three trolls live in this area, two males 
that fight constantly and one immense, dominant female 
that lazes near the black gate. They wait to be fed or 
given prisoners to play with, which allows the charac­
ters a few moments to decide on a course of action. If 
the party lingers, it's likely to dawn on the trolls that the 
characters are fair game. 
Glyph Key. The female troll has a glyph key attuned 
to this zone, with which she and her allies can pursue 
fleeing characters. 
White Gate. A white gate is situated in the opening in 
the wall that leads to the Forest of Weakness. 
55. POOL OF CONSUMPTION 
I A pool in this cavern glows with pale gray light. 
The pool's necromancy magic grants undead creatures 
that drink from it the benefits of finishing a short rest. 
An undead creature can drink from the pool safely only 
once per tenday. The second time the creature drinks in 
a tenday, its hit point maximum is halved for one tenday 
(remove curse negates this effect). The third time the 
creature drinks in a tenday, it suffers the effects of a 
harm spell (save DC 15). 
It isn't safe for a non-undead creature to drink from 
the pool. If the creature does, it gains no benefits and 
takes 22 (4dl0) necrotic damage. 
56. BEHIR LAIR 
The trees in this forested cavern are scorched and 
gouged. The turf is burned and overturned, revealing the 
stone floor in places. 
A behir spends its days sleeping and eating in this 
chamber. The creature is asleep or otherwise preoccu­
pied when the characters come here. It doesn't attack 
unless provoked. 
White Gate. A white gate is located in the passage to 
the north that connects with the Iron Golem Foundries. i

zone. When an intruder ends its turn in an area of •ree . 
the creature must make a DC 15 Strength sa\ing ·hrow. 
On a failed save, the creature become paralyzed ·or 1 
minute. The creature repeats the saving chrow a ·he 
end of each of its turns, ending the effect on it elf on a 
uccessful save. 
57. LEUCROTTA LAIR 
This area resembles a tranquil meadow dotted with a 
few trees. I 
Tracks. The ground seems to be covered with the 
cracks of large deer or elk, but a successful DC 25 In­
celligence (Nature) check reveals that these tracks are 
chose of leucrottas. 
Creatures. Four leucrottas (see appendix B) lurk 
here among the trees. They make noises that sound like 
the calls of pained humans, which their handlers nor­
mally ignore. The creatures gleefully attack anyone they 
ucceed in tricking. 
White Gates. A white gate sits in the opening to the 
north that leads to the Forest of Death. Another gate lies 
to the south, giving access to the Forest of Recovery. 
58. POOL OF RENEWAL 
A pool in this cavern glows with pale yellow light. North­
east of the pool, the turf gives way to a stone floor with a 
black gate set into it. East of the gate is a contact stone. 
Pool. The pool's magic grants creatures that drink 
from it the benefits of a greater restoration or a lesser 
restoration spell (creature's choice). A creature can 
drink from the pool safely only once per tenday. The 
econd time the creature drinks in a tenday, its hit point 
maximum is halved for one tenday (remove curse ne­
gates this effect). The third time the creature drinks in a 
cenday, it suffers the effects of a harm spell (save DC 15). 
59. CHOKER GROTTO 
This big side chamber has a few small copses of trees 
and a few piles of bones. 
Bones. The gnawed bones of six humans are here. 
Each has crushed neck vertebrae, which someone 
can discern with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Medi­
cine) check. 
Creatures. Six chokers (see appendix B) live here. 
cwo lurking in each of the two treed areas near the 
pool and two on the walls near the pool. They wait 
and watch, attacking when the character move within 
reach, which their handlers rarely do. The chokers in 
che trees try to pull victims into the treed area . I 60. 0WLBEAR GROVE 
The trees grow closer together in this cavern, giving it 
! the look of a silent forest. A monstrous owl bear crouches 
low at a pool of still water, its razor-sharp beak and bright 
eyes on display as its gaze tracks you. 
Two adult owlbears and three reduced-threat owlbear 
young (see "Reduced-Threat Monsters, " page 113) lurk 
among the trees here. They wait long enough to see if 
food is being handed out, and they attack if none seems 
forthcoming. The young are hidden, and they join the 
fight from the flanks after their parents attack. 
White Gate. The passage that leads east has a white 
gate that connects with the Prison of Filth. 
OOZE GROTTOS 
The Red Wizards use the magic of this sector to breed 
and control oozes. 
Locations in the Ooze Grottos are identified 
on map 5.8. 
Ooze Prod. An ooze prod is a quarterstaff that deals 
ld4 force damage instead of the normal damage of that 
weapon. The prod suffers no damage from contact with 
oozes. In addition, an ooze hit by a prod has its speed 
reduced to O until the end of its next turn, and it can't 
benefit from bonuses to speed during that time. If an 
ooze prod is used as a weapon, it breaks the first time a 
natural 1 is rolled on an attack roll with it. 
Interactions. Most living Thayans assigned to this 
sector hate being here. Thayans who surrender here 
hate the sector so much that they are more inclined to 
give truthful information about it. 
Sentient Oozes. One of the many experiments in the 
Doomvault is an effort to infuse oozes with intelligence. 
The Red Wizards have met with some success, though 
the process requires the sacrifice of many subjects. 
The sentient oozes that result from this process are the 
same as normal versions of such monsters , except that 
they have Intelligence 5, can understand basic commu­
nication in Common, and are no longer immune to be­
ing charmed. 
AUGMENTATION CHAMBERS 
The magic of these chambers allows Thayans to bestow 
glimmers of intelligence into living oozes, making them 
obedient and more capable combatants . 
61. BONE ROOM 
I Cracked and decaying bones are piled throughout this I 
chamber. In the northwest corner is a black gate. 
Creatures. Three sentient ochre jellies and a wight 
guard this area. The wight confront s anyone who enters 
but stands down if the characters look like Thayans and 
give a credible reason for being here. Otherwis e, the 
creatures attack. 
CHAPTER 5 I DEAD IN THAY

--- PAGE 143 ---

142 MAP 5.8: Oou GROTTOS 
Bone Piles. Here lie fragments of bone left from bod­
ies destroyed in attempts to infuse oozes with humanoid 
intelligence. The piles are 3 feet high. It costs 15 feet of 
movement to move 5 feet across a pile. A creature that 
enters or starts its turn in a pile takes 4 (ld8) acid dam­
age. A creature can take this damage only once per turn. 
White Gate. A white gate stands at the junction in the 
corridor to the northeast, leading to the Spawn Pools 
and to the Blood Pools. 
62. OOZE TEMPLE 
This chamber has stone benches, columns, and a raised 
altar, all suggesting it might have once been a temple or 
forum. Skeletons are arrayed across the benches. 
Creatures. Two deathlock wights (see appendix B) 
with buckets and stone boots move among dozens of 
skeletons. They pour steaming ooze over the bones. Two 
sentient ochre jellies and two sentient gray oozes are 
pooled near the benches. 
Spilled Ooze. The spilled ooze essence makes the 
area around the benches difficult terrain. Any creature 
that ends its turn in the area of the spilled ooze takes 4 
(ld8) acid damage. The wights aren't affected, thanks to 
their boots. 
Raised Altar. This raised altar is 10 feet above the 
floor. It has sides of smooth stone. 
White Gate. The corridor to the east contains a white 
gate that leads to the Spawning Pools. 
CHAPTER 5 I DEAD IN THAY 63. PAWN VATS 
The ound of flowing and bubbling liquid is audible from 
the northern hallway leading to this chamber. 
T s enormous chamber of gray stone is filled with 
square vats made of the same material. At the center of 
the chamber, a great fountain spews black liquid that 
lands in a wide stone pool. Trenches cut into the floor 
run from the fountain bowl to the vats. The eastern wall 
of the chamber is partly covered by a long black curtain. 
Creatures. Two deathlock wights (see appendix B) 
and four skeletons move among the vats, using ooze 
prods to poke the mixtures. They challenge any intrud­
ers. If the undead become distracted, oozes might attack 
(see "Vat System" below). 
Sarkalla, a Red Wizard transmuter (see appendix B), 
is working behind the black curtain, but she peeks out 
in response to the wights' challenge. She whispers to 
order the lead wight to attack. A character who succeeds 
on a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check notices Sarkalla 
while she does so. 
Quite mad, Sarkalla cares only for her experiments 
and her "precious children" -the oozes that she is 
working to imbue with intelligence in order to create 
"the perfect assassins." If she and her wights have the 
upper hand in combat, or if all the wights are destroyed, 
she calls for a break in hostilities. She proudly talks of 
the sentient oozes that will wreak havoc for Thay. She 
promises the characters positions as assistants and 
bodyguards to the Ooze Master (see area 65). If the 
characters accept, they are allowed to leave and go to 
area 64. Sarkalla otherwise attacks again and fights un­
til killed. 
Vat System. A 10-foot-high, circular magic fountain 
forms the center of a vat system. Around it are 3-foot­
high square vats. Trenches, each 2 feet wide and 1 foot 
deep, connect the fountain to the vats. The whole system 
contains necrotic essence that prepares oozes for bind­
ing to undead. 
A creature that enters the necrotic essence for the 
first time on a turn, or starts its turn there, takes 5 (2d4) 
necrotic damage and must succeed on a DC 11 Constitu­
tion saving throw or become paralyzed until the start of 
its next turn. 
Six of the eight square vats each contain one ooze, all 
of them reduced-threat versions of the creatures (see 
"Reduced-Threat Monsters," page 113). Two vats hold 
black puddings (marked B on the map), one has a gray 
ooze (G), and three contain ochre jellies (0). Usually, 
wights use ooze prods to keep the oozes in the vats. If 
the wights are engaged in combat, roll a d6 at the end 
of every round. If the indicated ooze is still in a vat, it 
escapes and tries to attack the nearest creatures. 
d6 Ooze 
1-2 Black pudding

--- PAGE 144 ---

Black Curtain. Beyond a heavy blac -ctr a-
lla has her quarters, which contain a bed. a a 
with writing implements and books. and , 
with bound volumes and scrolls. 
Contact Stone. A circle of glowing glyph above 
Sarkalla's southern table is a contact tone. 
Treasure. Sarkalla's table and shelve con a· two 
pieces of lore, four spell scrolls (two each of di pel 
magic and greater restoration) , a potion of greacer 
healing, a potion of heroism, and six valuable tome on 
underground exploration and natural history (worth 
120 gp each). 
Glyph Key. Sarkalla has a glyph key attuned to this 
zone, the Immortal Caverns, the Spawning Pools. 
and the Temples of Nature (in the Temples of Ex­
traction sector) . 
White Gate. The passage to the south has a white gate 
that connects with the Immortal Caverns. 
IMMORTAL CAVERNS 
Horrifying by-products of the Red Wizards' dark ooze 
experiments are found here. 
64. WHITE MAW 
This area is unlit. 
The cavern walls here are dry white stone, as is the clean 
floor. Toward the center, a massive, cracked black pillar 
rises to the dark ceiling. 
Creature. The cavern is occupied by White Maw (see 
appendix B), a gray ooze so enormous that it covers 
the entire floor and much of the walls. Unlike the other 
entient oozes, this one is quite intelligent (Intelligence 
12) and has the ability to communicate telepathically to 
creatures within 50 feet of it. 
As soon as the last character enters, solid white 
·stone" closes over each exit as White Maw seals the 
characters within itself. The ooze is insane and displays 
multiple personalities of the creatures that were sacri­
ficed to imbue it with sentience . Although it might com­
municate briefly with the characters, eventually mad­
ness takes hold and it attacks, slamming the characters 
with pseudopods that manifest from the floor or walls. 
The characters attack it by targeting the floor or walls of 
the cavern. 
When White Maw drops to O hit points, cracks shoot 
hrough the smooth white stone, which collapses to 
white dust, exposing the exits and dropping the charac­
ters 1 foot to the actual floor of dark stone. 
Black Pillar. The black pillar is infused with psionic 
energy. Any creature that touches it for the first 
time on a turn takes 9 (2d8) psychic damage and is 
knocked prone. 
White Gates. The opening to the north contains a 
white gate that connects with the Augmentation Cham­
bers. To the northeast is another white gate that leads to 
the Spawning Pools. 65. RED MASTER 
An enormous pillar of thick red liquid stretches from 
floor to ceiling in this cavern. Embedded within the pillar 
1s a whispering, crimson-robed humanoid form. 
To the northeast is a black gate. East of the gate is a 
1 contact stone. 
Creature. A Red Wizard known only as the Ooze 
Master (see appendix B) has melded with the pillar of 
red ooze. He uses his powers to make sure the red pillar 
consumes those who come here. 
The Ooze Master is the result of a failed experiment 
to blend a Red Wizard with ooze. When the characters 
arrive, the Ooze Master assumes they are Thayan ap­
prentices come to join him "in immortality." He greets 
them and honors their "great sacrifice." The Ooze Mas­
ter knows if White Maw has been killed (though not who 
did it), and vows to use the characters ' power, once it is 
consumed, to seek out and punish those responsible. He 
also speaks of "the great transformation, " when all Red 
Wizards will be joined with oozes. 
Red Pillar. The red pillar flows like viscous fluid. 
When a creature moves within 10 feet of the pillar, the 
creature feels its body soften. Whenever a creature 
starts its turn within 10 feet of the pillar, the creature 
must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or 
take 7 (2d6) acid damage. A creature that drops to O hit 
points due to this effect dies and collapses into a puddle 
of gooey red liquid. The fluid then flows into the pillar. 
Dungeon State. The Ooze Master is a sort of lich. If 
destroyed, he remains in the red pillar but doesn't re­
gain consciousness. His unconscious form whispers as 
if dreaming. The Ooze Master dies only if the Phylactery 
Vault is disabled at the end of the adventure. 
White Gate. In the passage to the southeast is a white 
gate that leads to the Forest of Illusion. 
66. BLACK ELDER 
I In the brilliant light shed by the white pillar at the center I 
of this cavern, a pool of mottled black liquid gleams. 
Light. The white pillar fills this area with bright light. 
Pool. Silvery calm water forms this highly reflective, 
1-foot-deep pool. Until a character looks into the pool 
and notices its mirrorlike nature, it takes a successful 
DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check to notice that quality. 
Creature. An elder black pudding (Huge size; 130 hit 
points) lurks on the ceiling here, reflected in the pool. 
Unless a character looks up and sees the ooze, it quickly 
slides down the pillar and attacks with surprise. 
White Pillar. A creature that starts its turn within 20 
feet of the pillar regains ld6 hit points. If this effect re­
stores a wounded creature to its hit point maximum, the 
creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving 
throw or become blinded until it finishes a short rest. 
CHAPTER 5 1 DEAD IN THAY 

--- PAGE 145 ---

r44 SPAWNING POOLS 
In these connected chambers, Red Wizards breed oozes 
for their experiments. 
Noise. Anyone near area 68 can hear the loud sound 
of steel grinding flesh and bone, rising and falling at 
intervals. The noise means that Thayans here fail to per­
ceive sounds of combat from nearby areas. 
Glyph Keys. Every one of the Red Wizards in this 
zone has a glyph key attuned to this zone. 
67. LABORATORY BARRACKS 
! Dozens of fine gilt mirrors stand between silk hangings 
along the walls of this once-splendid salon. A dozen 
rough cots are spread across the center of the room. 
Shrouded magic lights are set into floor stands between 
them, dimly lighting the area. 
Near a niche along the eastern wall is a black gate. 
Advance Notice. Any character who studies the room 
for a moment and succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Per­
ception) check notices that all the cots and lights are 10 
feet or more away from the walls. l 
Creatures. One Red Wizard transmuter and three 
Thayan apprentices sleep here (see appendix B for 
both stat blocks). When roused, they tip the cots over 
and cast their spells from behind cover. They try to force 
or draw the characters close to the walls and the magic 
mirrors, hoping to summon the deadly defenders of 
this area. 
Cursed Mirrors. Cursed mirrors are on all the walls 
except those within 5 feet of the exit points, including 
the black gate and the secret door. Conjuration magic in 
the mirrors works such that any living humanoid that 
moves within 5 feet of one must succeed on a DC 15 
Wisdom saving throw, or a howling specter emerges 
from the mirror to attack. Once they have collectively 
called forth five undead, the mirrors all become dor­
mant for 1 hour. 
White Gates. The corridor leading west has a white 
gate that connects with the Augmentation Chambers. 
Beyond the secret door to the east is a gate that offers 
access to the Blood Pools. 
68. ARCH OF BLADES 
A large archway of worked stone stands at the center 
of this curving cavern. A stack of pig carcasses is piled 
haphazardly along the eastern wall. Buckets are arrayed 
on the northern side of the arch, as well as along the 
southern wall. 
On the wall to the west of the arch is a contact stone. 
Creatures. One Red Wizard transmuter oversees 
two Thayan apprentices (see appendix B for both stat 
blocks) and six skeletons here. Four skeletons drag pig 
CHAPTER 5 I DEAD IN THAY carca es toward the arch and heave them through, 
while blades scythe across the opening and reduce each 
body to a heap of blood, flesh, and bone that collects 
on rhe far side. Two skeletons then pick up shovels and 
collect the gore in buckets, making the flesh easier to 
rran port. 
ff rhe characters watch long enough, the apprentices 
eventually carry full buckets toward the southern en­
trance and retrieve empty buckets stacked there. 
Arch of Blades. The 3-foot-thick, 15-foot-diameter 
arch is a former trap imbued with enchantment magic. 
The Red Wizards suppressed the magic, but they 
couldn't do away with it completely. Any non-undead 
creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the arch 
must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be 
compelled to run through the opening (a creature ig­
nores this effect if immune to being charmed). 
The magic blades in the arch come to life when any 
creature comes within 5 feet of the opening. A creature 
that moves through the arch must make a DC 15 Dex­
terity saving throw, taking 33 (6dl0) slashing damage 
on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful 
one. A creature compelled to run through the arch must 
make another DC 15 Wisdom saving throw after doing 
so. On a failed save, the creature stops moving while 
still within 5 feet of the arch. The creature can willingly 
move farther away only after the start of its next turn. 
A creature that succeeds on two Wisdom saving 
throws against the arch's effect becomes immune to the 
effect for 24 hours. 
White Gate. The passage to the northeast contains a 
white gate, which connects with the Culling Pens. 
69. SPAWN CAVERN 
I Broad, circular pools are spread across this cavern, each ] 
filled with dark goo. The area smells of blood. 
Creatures. One Red Wizard transmuter (see appen­
dix B) oversees two Thayan apprentices (see appendix 
B) in this cavern. They walk a circuit around the pools, 
carefully jabbing down into them with the ooze prods 
they carry. 
Spawn Pools. These 5-foot-deep pools are filled with 
ravenous ooze spawn that are nourished into full-grown 
oozes by feeding them pig meat. Each pool contains 
gray oozes, ochre jellies, or black puddings. The pools 
are magically warded to keep the spawn from climbing 
up the interior walls, but that doesn't keep them from 
striking out at nearby creatures with their pseudopods. 
Any creature that starts its turn adjacent to a spawn 
pool must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw 
or take 7 (2d6) acid damage. If a creature strikes a pool 
with an ooze prod, the pool's pseudopod attacks are sup­
pressed until the end of that creature's next turn. 
A creature that enters a pool for the first time on a 
turn, or starts its turn in one, takes 9 (2d8) acid damage. 
White Gate. The route to the southwest contains a 
white gate that connects with the Immortal Caverns. 

--- PAGE 146 ---

CULLING PENS 
Young oozes feed on each other in the grea 
fill these caverns. 
-o. BATTLE POOL 
If creatures occupy this area, those that approach it can 
hear the sounds of thrashing in liquid. 
A jet-black pool that roils like a storm-tossed sea :a es 
up half this cavern. 
Creatures. One Red Wizard transmuter (see appen­
dix B) and two Thayan apprentices (see appendix B) 
are focused on the black pool with their ooze prods. 
',\'hen the Thayans turn away to deal with the char­
acters, a Medium reduced-threat black pudding (see 
·Reduced-Th reat Monsters," page 113) emerges from 
he ooze pool at the start of the second round. Another 
such pudding emerges at the start of the fourth round, 
and another at the start of the sixth round. The Thayans 
:ry to keep the characters between themselves and the 
pool, since the oozes see all other creatures as prey. 
Ooze Pool. Filled with reduced-threat black puddings, 
:he pool is 2 feet deep and difficult terrain. Trans­
mutation magic on the pool keeps most of the puddings 
n a torpid state so that they react only to stimulation 
'.rom a nearby source. A creature that enters the pool 
or the first time on a turn, or starts its turn there, takes 
13 (3d8) acid damage. In addition, every time a creature 
moves 5 feet in the pool, the creature is subject to an op­
portunity attack from a black pudding. 
Black Gate. A black gate is set into the western al­
cove, not immediately visible from the entrance. 
White Gate. To the southwest, a white gate separates 
-his area from the Spawning Pools. 
-1. DEAD POOL 
A reeking, acrid pool of slime and sludge fills most of this 
cavern, leaving only a rocky ledge to both sides. 
East of the pool is a contact stone. 
Noise. Unless areas 72 and 73 have been cleared, 
combat noise in those areas can be heard here. 
Acidic Vapor. The air contains acidic vapors. A crea­
ure that starts its turn here must succeed on a DC 10 
Constitution saving throw or take 2 (ld4) acid damage. 
A creature that holds its breath or doesn't need to 
breathe has advantage on the saving throw. 
Ooze Pool. Filled with the remains of dead oozes, the 
pool is 2 feet deep and difficult terrain. A creature that 
enters the pool for the first time on a turn, or starts its 
turn there, takes 9 (2d8) acid damage and 9 (2d8) poi­
-on damage. 
Development. Any noise in this area alerts creatures 
in areas 72 and 73. 
White Gate. The exit to the south ha a white gate 
chat connects with the Forest of Reco\'ery. 72. OOZE DUEL 
This cavern bears minor signs of multiple combats. I 
Creatures. One Red Wizard transmuter (see appen­
dix B) and two dread warriors (see appendix B) watch 
from near the eastern wall as four Thayan warriors 
(see appendix B) battle a gelatinous cube. Two of the 
four warriors have been engulfed, and all are at half hit 
points (as is the ooze). If the wizard notices the charac­
ters aren't Thayan, he orders the others to attack them 
instead. The cube views everyone in the area as a foe. 
73. JELLY PIT 
I A rough pit takes up half of this cavern. I 
Creatures. One Red Wizard transmuter (see appen­
dix B) and two Thayan apprentices (see appendix B) 
use ooze prods to keep three Medium reduced-threat 
ochre jellies (see "Reduced-Threat Monsters," page 
113) in the pit and fighting. When the Thayans start 
combat with the characters, each of the three oozes 
emerges from the pit ld4 rounds later (roll for each). 
The oozes see all other creatures as prey. 
Jelly Pit. Filled with young, reduced-threat ochre jel­
lies, living and dead, the pit is 3 feet deep and difficult 
terrain. Transmutation magic on the pit keeps most of 
the jellies in a torpid state so they react only to stimu­
lation from a nearby source. A creature that enters the 
pool for the first time on a turn, or starts its turn there 
takes 9 (2d8) acid damage. ln addition, every time a ' 
creature moves 5 feet in the pit, the creature is subject 
to an opportunity attack from an ochre jelly. 
White Gate. The corridor that leads southeast holds a 
white gate that provides access to the Forest of Death. 
PREDATOR POOLS 
The Red Wizards' plans involve the disruption and con­
trol of the Sword Coast's trade. To that end, the Thayans 
are spawning an aquatic army. 
Locations in the Predator Pools are identified 
on map 5.9. 
Pools. The saltwater pools in this sector are 50 feet 
deep, and the surface of each pool is 1 foot below the 
surrounding floor. lt takes 5 extra feet of movement to 
move from a pool onto the floor. Unless otherwise noted, 
transmutation magic in each pool keeps the water clean. 
The pools also exude enchantment magic. Living in 
the water causes hypnotic dreams that, after weeks or 
months of exposure, improve combat skill and imbue 
most creatures with strong devotion to the Red Wizards. 
Reactions. Creatures in this sector usually hesitate 
to attack those who seem to be Thayan but quickly over­
come this reticence if the characters linger and fail to 
act according to type. Most aquatic monsters prefer to 
drag foes into the water. 
Water Globes. Floating 5 feet above the floor, these 
magic water globes are 15 feet in diameter. Red Wizards

MAP 5.9: PREDATOR POOLS 
use them to hold aquatic creatures for transport through 
the black gates. 
As an action, a creature that is within 5 feet of a 
globe and has an Intelligence score of 10 or higher can 
take control of the globe by succeeding on a DC 10 
Intelligence check. As part of its movement and with a 
successful DC 10 Intelligence check, the controller can 
direct the globe to move with it, remaining within 5 feet 
of the controller. A globe's controller can enter and leave 
the globe at will. The controller can maintain control of 
the globe while within 100 feet of it. Another creature 
that qualifies as a controller can gain control of a globe 
by winning a contest of Intelligence checks against the 
current controller. 
CHAPTER 5 I DEAD IN THAY A creature that touches a globe but isn't its controller 
mu t ucceed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be 
drawn into the globe and unable to pass back through 
it boundary. As an action, a trapped creature can free 
itself with a successful DC 15 Intelligence check. Also 
a an action, a globe's controller can release a trapped 
creature with a successful DC 10 Intelligence check. 
A creature inside a globe has half cover against effects 
that originate outside the globe. While inside a globe, a 
trapped creature can't contest for control of the globe. 
POOLS OF DEVOTION 
A spirit naga oversees this zone and its creatures. 
74. KRAKEN POOL 
l Beyond a broad round pool in the center of this circular 
chamber is a black gate. 
A malformed kraken (see appendix B) is held in this 
saltwater pool. Although it responds to specific orders 
from Red Wizards, it attacks anyone in the room who 
looks over the edge of the pool. 
White Gates. The corridor that connects this area 
with the Fiendish Arena has a white gate. Another one 
is to the east, behind a set of doors and a secret door, in 
the passage that leads to the Halls of Conditioning. 
75. DRAGON TURTLE PRISON 
If the dragon turtle occupies this area, characters 
approaching can hear the rattle and clank of im­
mense chains. 
Gigantic steel bolts have been driven into the stone floor 
of this immense area, attached to heavy chains. These 
trail down into the water of a vast pool situated between 
curving northern and southern staircases that lead up to 
double doors. Two enormous globes of blue liquid are 
suspended in the air to the east. 
Creatures. One reduced-threat dragon turtle (see 
"Reduced-Threat Monsters," page 113)-it has no tail 
attack-recently taken from Lake Thaylambar, has been 
chained here while the insidious mind control magic of 
the pools takes effect. Not yet under the sway of Thay, it 
grows agitated when any creature enters this chamber, 
and it's likely to attack. 
The dragon turtle wants freedom, and it is small 
enough to use a black gate. Any offer of freedom, includ­
ing the use of a glyph key, causes a break in hostilities 
while the creature listens. If it is freed, unless the char­
acters know of the circle in area 82, the dragon turtle 
goes to area 76 and escapes through the gatehouse. 
The turtle knows that Ihanvas, the naga overseer of 
this zone, dwells in area 76. It can be persuaded with a 
successful DC 17 Charisma (Persuasion) check to fight 
the naga if it is lured into this chamber. ' 

--- PAGE 148 ---

Chains. Magic infuses the chains. whic a. 
enough to allow the dragon turtle free ru 
ber. When the dragon turtle moves, any crea 
10 feet of its path must succeed on a DC 1] D 
aving throw or be knocked prone. 
The dragon turtle can't harm or break rhe binding 
chains. The characters can open each of rhe cwo pin 
locks with a separate successful DC 20 Dexterity check. 
White Gate. Behind the doors to the south i a white 
gate that connects with the Warrior Pools. 
-6. NAGA'S DEN 
If the spirit naga occupies this area, anyone who listens 
ac the entry doors hears a scream of pain. 
The magical light shimmers off two circular pools in this 
chamber . A glowing glyph covers a broad area of the floor 
in the south. On the eastern wall is a contact stone. 
Creatures. Ihanvas, the spirit naga overseer of this 
zone, is eating a prisoner. The naga attacks any in­
iruders. Ten commoners also linger in the pools here. 
:hanvas's Charisma, combined with the magic water, 
has turned them into the naga's willing devotees. They 
defend their master in any battle. 
Southern Interior Door. The southern door to area 
-7 is locked. 
Curse Glyph. Ihanvas wants to block direct access to 
her lair from area 77, so a magic glyph has been placed 
in the area marked on the map. Any creature that enters 
the marked area must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom sav­
ing throw or have disadvantage on attack rolls against 
rhe naga, while the naga has advantage on saving 
throws against the creature's capabilities. The effect is a 
curse that lasts until Ihanvas dies. 
Pools. A lip around the interior edge of each pool 
-orms a 5-foot shelf where the water is only 3 feet deep. 
Further, a tunnel connects each pool to the other at the 
bottom, so the two pools are really one U-shaped struc­
ture, which Ihanvas can use to move through the room. 
Treasure. The naga wears a platinum circlet set with 
apphires (worth 1,000 gp) and matching earrings (500 
gp for the pair). 
Hidden at the bottom of the pools' connecting tunnel, 
Ihanvas's treasure includes 200 pp, five tourmaline jew­
els (100 gp each), +l plate and a sealed ivory case that 
holds seven spell scrolls (two each of detect magic, iden­
cify, and lesser restoration , and one of remove curse). 
Glyph Key. Ihanvas carries a glyph key attuned to 
this zone, the Warrior Pools, the Spawn Pools, and the 
Blood Pools. 
White Gate. Behind the doors to the south is a white 
gate that connects with the Warrior Pools. 
WARRIOR POOLS 
This gruesome zone is packed with the foulest of the 
aquatic soldiers. 
Light. Unless otherwise noted, this zone has no 
light sources. 77. SCRAG POOL 
A circular pool in this chamber has foul slime filled with 
bits of bone along its edge. To the west is a black gate. I 
Creatures. Two trolls, a male and a larger female, 
lurk in the pool. These trolls are of an aquatic variety 
known as scrags. In addition to the statistics of a normal 
troll, each has a swim speed of 30 feet and can breathe 
underwater . 
Pool. The floor within 5 feet of the pool is crusted 
with the remains of the scrags' meals. If a creature 
makes a Dexterity saving throw while on the floor in 
this area and the saving throw fails, the creature falls 
prone. If the save fails by 5 or more, the creature then 
slides into the pool. 
White Gate. The corridor leading north has a white 
gate that separates this area from the Pools of Devotion. 
78. UNDEAD POOL 
The stench of death is overwhelming here. The pool at 
the center of this chamber is a blackened sea of floating 
corpses. Three enormous globes of blue liquid are sus­
pended in the air to the east. 
West of the pool, just south of a set of double doors, is 
a contact stone. 
Creatures. Eight ghouls here float like corpses in 
the water until they catch the scent of non-undead crea­
tures. These ghouls are of an aquatic variety known as 
lacedons. In addition to the statistics of a normal ghoul, 
each has a swim speed of 30 feet. 
Pool. The necromancy magic in this pool is intended 
not to keep it clean but to kill intruders. Any creature 
that makes an attack dealing radiant damage in this 
area must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or 
move to the pool and jump in as soon as it can. A crea­
ture that enters the pool for the first time on a turn, or 
starts its turn there, takes 9 (2d8) necrotic damage. 
Development. Any combat that lasts more than 3 
rounds attracts the scrags in area 77. They enter the fray 
here at the start of the fifth round. 
White Gates. The corridor leading north has a white 
gate that separates this area from the Pools of Devotion . 
To the south, a white gate stands in the corridor that 
leads to the Flesh Golem Mortuaries. 
79. BONE POOL 
The floor of this sweltering chamber and its pool are 
spread with a fine layer of shattered bone. The faint illu­
mination from a pair of low-burning braziers reveals piles 
of animal skulls set around the edge of the water. 
Creatures. Four merrow entertain themselves by dec­
orating their lair and chewing bones. 
CHAPTER 5 I DEAD IN THAY 147 

--- PAGE 149 ---

Pool. The magic of the pool has failed, and the water 
is filthy. Any non-undead creature that starts its turn in 
the pool must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving 
throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. 
Bones. Pig bones and humanoid bones are scattered 
across the floor, but a few 1-foot-high piles are diffi­
cult terrain. 
Braziers. The magic stone braziers are built into the 
room and can't be moved. A creature that touches a bra­
zier takes 3 (ld6) fire damage. A creature can take this 
damage only once per turn. 
White Gate. A white gate stands in the corridor that 
leads south to the Spawn Pools. 
SPAWN POOLS 
The Red Wizards refocused the magic of these once­
deadly pools to spawn aquatic creatures under the su­
pervision of a sea hag. 
Spawning Essence. Blue glowing water in this zone 
is spawning essence, the transmutation magic of which 
causes spawn to grow quickly and strengthens their 
predatory nature. A creature that drinks spawning 
essence gains the benefit of finishing a short rest. A hu­
manoid can safely gain this benefit only once per tenday. 
If a creature drinks again within that time, it gains no 
benefit and must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving 
throw or suffer the effects of a confusion spell for 1 
minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the 
end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a 
successful save. 
Spawn Pools. The round pools in this zone are cut 10 
feet deep into the surrounding stone floor. Spawn pools 
are filled with spawning essence. 
Spawn Pits. Rectangular 5-foot-deep spawn pits are 
filled with spawning essence. Each pit holds juvenile 
predatory fish. A creature that enters a pit for the first 
time on a turn, or starts its turn there, takes 2 (ld4) 
piercing damage from the attacks of these fish. 
80. BLACK GATE POOL 
Beneath walls set with relief carvings of humanoid cou­
ples romantically entwined, the bottom of a slimy, dimly 
luminous pool is shrouded in shadow. Trenches from the 
pool flow into one-foot-diameter tubes in the wall. An 
enormous globe of blue liquid is suspended in the air to 
the west. 
Creatures. Five kuo-toa are on guard. Another four 
are sleeping on the bottom of the pool. All of them are 
loyal to Thay and expect to be asked to escort those who 
pass through this area. They attack anyone who makes 
no such request. 
Black Gate. This zone's black gate is underwater at 
the bottom of the pool. 
Development. If combat lasts longer than 3 rounds, 
the activity draws the attention of the creatures in area 
81. They open the southern doors during the fourth 
round of combat and retreat to draw characters into the 
spawn pits in area 81. 
CHAPTER 5 I DEAD IN THAY White Gate. A white gate stands in the corridor that 
leads north to the Warrior Pools. 
81. SPAWN HALL 
Relief carvings along this arch-roofed hall show scenes 
of demons and humanoids engaged in debauchery. Five 
pits cut into the floor are filled with glowing water. South 
of these pools on a rough wall is a contact stone. 
Creatures. A dread warrior (see appendix B), two 
wights, and four zombies guard this area. They attack 
anyone who isn't escorted by kuo-toa or the sea hag, pur­
suing such interlopers to any area of the zone. 
Glyph Key. The dread warrior has a glyph key attuned 
to this zone. 
82. SEA HAG LAIR 
Two large pools fill a chamber whose walls are carved 
with reliefs of humanoids frolicking with cherubic angels. 
Water from the pools flows into pits that spread along 
the walls from one corner. A foul pile of debris and bones 
stands in the opposite corner of the chamber. 
Creatures. Two male merrow dwell in the south pool. 
A sea hag named Tanjus luxuriates under the surface 
of the north pool with her pets, six giant crabs. She 
oversees the spawning pools in this zone and yearns to 
overthrow Ihanvas (area 76) for control of the Predator 
Pools and their monsters. 
During combat, Tanjus offers the characters a tem­
porary truce. She asks them to find and kill Ihanvas, 
because Tanjus wants to be the dominant force in this 
portion of the dungeon. The hag offers two pieces of lore 
and promises that none of her creatures will leave this 
sector. She also says that the characters can move freely 
through this zone once the naga is disposed of. 
Development. If combat lasts longer than 3 rounds, 
the activity draws the attention of the creatures in area 
81. They open the southern doors during the fourth 
round of combat and attack unless Tanjus orders 
them not to. 
North Pool. A magic circle is scribed on the bottom 
of the north pool. It's a combination summoning circle 
and teleportation circle, but it's currently dormant. A 
spellcaster who succeeds on three DC 20 Intelligence 
(Arcana) checks can reactivate the circle's conjuration 
magic. The character then becomes aware that the 
circle allows teleportation to the sea floor off Bezantur, 
deep down in the Sea of Fallen Stars. 
Debris Pile. Any creature that starts its turn in this 
disgusting pile, which is difficult terrain, must succeed 
on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned 
until the start of its next turn. Creatures that live in this 
zone are immune to this effect. 
Secret Door. The secret door in the north wall is built 
just above the surface of the contents of the spawn pit. 

--- PAGE 150 ---

Treasure. Tanjus has a black pearl COO" a= den 
gorget set with aquamarines (1,000 gp. and a_ i1ff 
of charming. 
A character who succeeds on a DC 15 ·. ·~-om Per­
ception) check while searching the debris sco er 
five potions of water breathing and two spell 
•\·ater walk. 
Glyph Key. Tanjus has a glyph key attuned co this 
zone and the Pools of Devotion. 
Dungeon State. If the characters leave Tanju ali\·e 
and Ihanvas is killed, the hag and her merrow allie re­
_ocate to area 76. No matter what else happens. Tanjus 
and her monsters attack any characters who return to 
his zone. 
White Gates. A white gate stands at the junction in 
·he corridor to the south, which leads to the Augmenta­
tion Chambers and to the Blood Pools. Another white 
gate is located in the corridor to the north behind the 
-ecret door that leads toward the Blood Pools. 
BLOOD POOLS 
~he Red Wizards have the allegiance of sahuagin that 
are exiled from Aleaxtis in the Sea of Fallen Stars. 
Light. Unless otherwise notes, this zone has no 
ight sources. 
83. BARON'S COURT 
The pool that takes up most of this circular chamber is 
filled with clear water. Stone pillars rise from the bottom 
to break the surface. Sets of double doors are spaced 
evenly around the room's perimeter. 
Creatures. Six sahuagin swim along the surface 
around the edge of the pool, while a sahuagin baron 
and two hunter sharks swim deeper down. 
Enmity between the baron and the priestess (area 
-l) means that these sahuagin make no attempt to 
call for aid. 
The sahuagin know the hazards of the pillars. They 
aren't aware of the secret door. 
Paralysis Pillars. The tops of the pillars are even with 
he floor around the edge of the pool, so they protrude 1 
·oot above the surface of the water. The remnants of an 
old magical trap exist in the three pillars marked with 
an X on the map. A creature that ends its turn touching 
the top of one of those pillars must succeed on a DC 15 
Constitution saving throw or become paralyzed for 1 
minute. A paralyzed creature slips into the water and 
inks to the bottom of the pool. The creature can repeat 
che saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending 
the effect on itself on a successful save. 
Treasure. The baron wears +1 leather armor (shark 
kin and chitin) and a crown-like helm of ivory. coral, 
leather, and gold (worth 500 gp). 
At the bottom of the pool is a stone coffer that contains 
a stash of 100 pp and eight large pearls (100 gp). It also 
has a crystal phial that contains a potion of diminutio n. 
Glyph Key. The sahuagin baron has a glyph key at­
tuned to this zone. White Gates. In the corridor behind the secret door 
is a white gate that connects with the Spawn Pools. In 
the passage that leads east, a white gate stands between 
this area and the Stone Golem Quarries. 
84. ALTAR POOL 
If the sahuagin occupy this area, those approaching can 
hear chanting. 
r An octagonal pool fills this chamber. A slick of blood 
darkens the water around a stepped stone altar that sits 
on a broad pillar rising from the pool. Smaller pillars are 
spread around the central one. An enormous globe of 
blue liquid is suspended in the air to the north. 
Creatures. Four sahuagin stand and chant along with 
a sahuagin priestess on the altar pillar. Another five 
sahuagin and two hunter sharks dwell in the pool. A 
commoner is bound on the altar. 
The chanting that precedes the sacrifice takes 3 
rounds to complete . If the characters deal at least 20 
damage to the priestess in that time, she breaks off the 
ritual to lead a counterattack. Otherwise, the prisoner 
is slain and thrown to the sharks. Any sahuagin on the 
altar then gains the effects of the aid and bless spells. 
Enmity between the priestess and the baron (area 
83) means that these sahuagin make no attempt to 
call for aid. 
Altar Pillar. The outside area of the pillar is 1 foot 
above the surface of the water. The central altar rises 
3 feet above the outside pillar. It takes 5 extra feet of 
movement to move from the outside pillar to the top of 
the altar. 
Paralysis Pillars. See area 83. 
Prisoner. If the prisoner is saved, he is in the same 
mental state as the prisoners in area 85. He can't aid the 
characters or answer questions. 
Ledge. A 10-foot-high rough ledge separates this area 
from area 85. 
Treasure. The priestess carries a dagger of venom 
and wears a headdress of ivory, coral, leather, and gold 
(worth 500 gp). 
Glyph Key. The sahuagin priestess has a glyph key 
attuned to this zone. 
White Gates. The narrow exit to the south opens onto 
a white gate that offers access to the Spawning Pools. 
The northeast corridor contains a white gate that con­
nects with the Stone Golem Quarries. 
85. PRISONER CAVERN 
On the north wall of this cavern is a black stone shrine 
set with relief carvings of roses. On the wall about a foot 
above the arcane shrine is a contact stone. To the south 
is a black gate. 
Creatures. A dread warrior (see appendix B) keeps 
watch with seven skeletons. They do little but confront 
CHAPTER 5 1 DE.AD IN THAY 149 

--- PAGE 151 ---

creatures moving toward or appearing from either 
magic gate. The characters can enter and leave this area 
from the east without fighting, even with the prison-
ers in tow. 
Part of the deal the Red Wizards struck with the sa­
huagin involves providing prisoners for dark rites and 
horrid meals. The magic of the black shrine keeps ten 
commoners standing around it in a catatonic state. 
Black Shrine. Any non-undead creature that moves 
to within 20 feet of the black shrine or ends its turn in 
such a location must make a DC 15 Intelligence saving 
throw. On a failed save, the necromancy magic of the 
shrine lowers the creature's Intelligence , Wisdom, and 
Charisma scores by ld6 each (roll once for all three). 
A creature can be affected only once per round. If any 
affected score is reduced to 2 or lower, the character 
becomes paralyzed. A character who leaves the area re­
covers in 1 minute. 
Ledge. A 10-foot-high rough ledge separates this area 
from area 84. 
Glyph Key. The dread warrior has a glyph key attuned 
to this zone. 
GOLEM LABORATORIES 
In these formerly cursed temples and workshops, the 
Red Wizards create golems. 
Locations in the Golem Laboratories are identified 
on map 5.10. 
Go/ems. If a golem is inactive, it is unconscious. If a 
golem is listed as being a reduced-threat monster, it is 
because the construct is incomplete. 
Dungeon State. When these areas are cleared, any 
golems that remained inactive become inert and can't be 
activated thereafter. 
Treasure. The treasure in this sector consists of ma­
terials and tools used in the creation of the golems. As 
such, the value of the treasure is less than what might 
be expected. 
White Gate. A white gate stands at the junction in the 
corridor to the west, leading to the Augmentation Cham­
bers and to the Spawn Pools. 
FLESH GOLEM MORTUARIES 
Red Wizards bind and reanimate dead flesh and bone in 
these halls. 
86. HALL OF TELEPORTATION 
The walls of this massive hall are carved with reliefs of 
humanoid monarchs adorned with jeweled crowns and 
other finery, while servants bow at their feet. Huge white 
pillars rise to the ceiling. 
Creatures. Two reduced-threat helmed horrors and 
a reduced-threat flesh golem (see "Reduced-Threat 
Monsters," page 113) stand inactive here in front of pil­
lars. The golem hopes to draw on the pillars' lightning 
effect to become fully empowered. They come to life if 
attacked or when the teleportation magic of the pillars is 
triggered. 
CHAPTER 5 / DEAD IN THAY Teleporting Pillars. The first time a creature moves 
within 5 feet of a pillar on its turn, the creature must 
ucceed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be tele­
ported to a random space next to another pillar (roll a 
d20). The creature also takes 5 (2d4) lightning damage. 
If the destination pillar is the same as the origin pillar, 
the creature takes double damage. 
White Gate. The corridor that leads east has a white 
gate that connects with the Clay Golem Kilns. 
87. GOLEM VAULT 
Relief-carved walls showing nobles at a great feast make 
a stark counterpoint to the stench of preservatives with a 
hint of rot. Flesh golems in their first gruesome stages of 
assembly are on a few of the tables. Other tables contain 
only prepared body parts and bones. 
A contact stone is set in the midpoint of the 1 southern wall. 
Creatures. A Red Wizard necromancer (see appen­
dix B) and two Thayan apprentices (see appendix B) 
are in this area, moving among the tables working or se­
lecting parts. Four skeletons keep watch from the cor­
ners, while a ghoul mops gore from the floors. Golems 
in this area can't be activated and are no threat. 
Treasure. One table contains special unguents and 
bindings used in the creation of the golems. A character 
who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check 
realizes that these materials, which weigh 10 pounds, 
are worth 1,500 gp. 
Glyph Key. The Red Wizard has a glyph key attuned 
to this zone. 
White Gate. The eastern corridor holds a white gate 
that leads to the Clay Golem Kilns. 
88. BLACK PRISON 
A large stone block on the floor between the room's 
double doors prevents them from fully closing. Within, 
rusted black iron cages hang by heavy chains from the 
ceiling of this dark-walled chamber. In the northeast cor­
ner is a black gate. 
Creatures. A wight commands eight zombies who 
guard this chamber while some members of their squad 
recover in the cages. One deathlock wight (see appen­
dix B) and two wights rest in the cages. 
Cages. The bottoms of these unlocked cages hang 3 
feet above the floor. Necromancy magic on the cages 
restores 20 hit points per hour to an undead creature in 
a cage. A non-undead creature in a cage takes the same 
amount of necrotic damage at the end of each minute it 
remains in the cage. 
Doors. If the 800-pound stone block holding these 
doors open is removed, they magically slam shut. It 
takes a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check to 

--- PAGE 152 ---

force the doors open. A knock spell disrup -agic 
briefly, lowering the check DC to 15 for 1 min 
Glyph Keys. The wight and the deathloc " ,, 
each have a glyph key attuned to this zone. The death­
·ock wight's key is also attuned to all the zone in the 
Ooze Grottos. 
White Gate. The exit to the north has a white gate that 
onnects with the Warrior Pools. 
CLAY GOLEM KILNS 
Red Wizards have twisted this zone's magic toward the 
reation of clay golems. 
89. TRANSMUTATION PITS 
• 
Two sides of this chamber have collapsed to form shal­
ow, rough-walled pits filled with clay. Near the northern 
and southern corners are circles of sigils that glow with 
red light. 
In the eastern corner is a small array of urns and 
ooxes. Above them on the wall is a contact stone. 
Creatures. A Red Wizard transmuter (see appendix 
B works here with a dwarf cleric of Grumbar, a deity 
a sociated with caverns and earth. The dwarf assists 
n the creation of clay golems, which require divine 
:pellcasting. The dwarf priest, whose name is Gorvan 
ronheart, was recruited by the Red Wizards and offered 
a substantial sum of money for assistance in crafting the 
::olems. If he is questioned, he lies, claiming to be a pris­
=ner of the Red Wizards. If the characters spare him, 
e accompanies the party until he sees an opportunity 
-o escape. 
Also present is a reduced-threat clay golem (see 
Reduced-Threat Monsters," page 113). The wizard or 
:.he cleric can activate the golem by using an action and 
-ucceeding on a DC 15 Intelligence check. 
Clay Pits. These 3-foot-deep pits channel powerful 
-ransmutation magic that converts rock walls and floor 
•o clay for use in golem construction. The soft clay is dif­
-cult terrain. 
A creature that starts its turn in a clay pit must suc­
eed on a DC 13 Strength or Dexterity saving throw 
creature's choice) or take 5 (2d4) bludgeoning damage 
and become restrained in the clay until the start of 
next turn. A creature can escape the clay by suc­
eeding on the saving throw or by taking an action to 
make a successful DC 15 Strength check or Dexterity 
heck. Another creature can try to pull a restrained 
-reature free by taking an action to do so and succeed­
ng on a DC 15 Strength check. A creature that dies 
·hile trapped in the clay is transformed into a rough 
lay statue. 
Teleportation Circles. Set into the floor, these magic 
-eleportation circles have been partially disabled. A 
-reature that enters a circle's area is pushed back 10 
feet and knocked prone. The first time a creature does 
:o on a turn, the creature takes 5 (2d4) force damage. 
Treasure. In the eastern corner are a few jars of rare 
oils and boxes of rare powders used in the creation of MAP 5.10: GoLEM LABORATORIES 
the golems, along with some empty containers. A char­
acter who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) 
check realizes that these materials, which weigh 15 
pounds, are worth 3,000 gp. 
Glyph Key. The Red Wizard has a glyph key attuned 
to this zone. 
White Gate. The corridor leading west contains a 
white gate, which leads to the Flesh Golem Mortuaries. 
90. GOLEM PEN 
Pillars of white marble glow with an intense white light 
that brightly illuminates the area. The light is so bright 
that it almost obscures the arcane glyphs carved in the 
archways that lead into the room. 
Pillars of Light. The intense bright light, created by 
evocation magic in the pillars, causes disadvantage on 
ranged attack rolls and ability checks made to search or 
see in this area. In addition, whenever a creature starts 
its turn in the chamber proper (not in an entryway next 
to the glyphs), it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution 
saving throw or become blinded until the start of its 
next turn. 
Arcane Glyphs. In the entryways , arcane glyphs 
on the wall can be used to control the pillars. When 
someone touches the glyphs, the pillars flicker. It takes 
a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check to under­
stand exactly how the glyphs function. A detect magic 
spell shows that the abjuration aura of the glyphs is 
connected to the evocation magic of the pillars, thereby 
revealing the function of the glyphs without a check. 
A character who understands how the glyphs work 
can take an action to touch the glyphs and subdue the 
CHAPTER 5 I DEAD IN THAY 15r 

--- PAGE 153 ---

r52 pillars with a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) 
check or deactivate them with a successful DC 15 In­
telligence (Arcana) check. Subdued pillars shine less 
intensely for 1 minute, and the DC for the saving throw 
against them becomes 8. While the pillars are subdued, 
golems in this area regain 5 (2d4) hit points at the start 
of each of their turns. Deactivated pillars go dark for 1 
minute, then are subdued for another minute, and then 
return to normal function. 
Creatures. A clay golem in this area activates the first 
time a character fails a saving throw against the pillars, 
deactivates them, or subdues them. 
White Gates. The corridor to the west has a white 
gate that provides access to the Flesh Golem Mortuar­
ies. The passage heading southeast has a white gate that 
connects with the Stone Golem Quarries. 
91. HALL OF SKULLS 
Three of the skulls here connect to corridors, which the 
Thayans simply avoid. Characters who approach this 
room see the following. 
l Ahead is a broad archway of dimly glowing green stone. ] 
Inside it is a field of dead gray mist. 
Any creature that moves within 5 feet of the mist must 
succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be pulled 
into it and shunted violently into area 91, falling prone 
and taking 3 (ld6) bludgeoning damage. 
Inside the room is the following scene. 
Six enormous fiendish skulls are set into the walls of this 
vast rectangular hall, two on each long side and one on 
each short side. Each skull is twenty feet high and carved 
of dimly glowing green stone, and it has a wide-open 
fanged mouth filled with dead gray mist. 
In the center of the chamber is a black gate. 
Fiendish Skulls. The fiendish skulls are imbued with 
powerful magic. When any character steps into a skull's 
mouth, macabre laughter erupts from the northwest 
corner. The character is teleported to the mouth of a 
different skull (roll a d6) and comes tumbling back into 
the room, falling prone and taking 3 (ld6) bludgeon­
ing damage. 
The character must then succeed on a DC 15 saving 
throw (the ability is tied to the skull's number; see the 
table) or suffer the skull's curse. The curses are cumu­
lative, imposing a -ld4 penalty to checks and saving 
throws of the indicated ability. If a character has a pen­
alty of -5 or greater to a single ability, the character also 
suffers the curse's secondary effect. 
CHAPTER 5 I DEAD IN THAY Slrull Ability Secondary Effect

Secret Door. In the northwest corner, 20 feet above 
the floor, a secret door is hidden. The door is nearly im­
possible to find from the floor, requiring a successful DC 
30 Wisdom (Perception) check. The smooth wall is hard 
to climb without aid, but the vaulted ceiling provides 
places where a grappling hook might catch. 
Beyond the secret door, a teleportation circle set into 
the floor of a small chamber glows with a deep red light. 
A creature that steps into the circle is teleported into 
one of the two circles in area 89 (determine randomly). 
Black Gate. Because it must be activated before it 
can be used, the black gate here doesn't exude shadowy 
energy. Any character who successfully assesses the 
gate knows that it must be activated and how to do so. 
A character who succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence (Ar­
cana) check while holding a glyph key, which need not 
be attuned to this zone, can reactivate the gate. The DC 
decreases by 2 each time a character in the room enters 
the mouth of a fiendish skull. Once the gate reactivates, 
it also attunes the activator's glyph key to this zone. 
White Gates. Each of the corridors on the southeast 
wall has a white gate. One connects with the Stone Go­
lem Quarries, the other with the Iron Golem Foundries. 
STONE GOLEM QUARRIES 
The Red Wizards have manipulated this zone's magic to 
enable the creation of stone golems. 
92. TIMELESS PRISON 
A statue of an angelic female stands on a raised dais in 
the center of this chamber, the walls of which glow dimly 
with golden light. Six cracked pillars support the crum­
bling ceiling, each carved in its lower portions to resem­
ble a four-armed gargoyle shrieking in rage. 
To the northeast is a black gate. 
Light. When the characters first enter this area, the 
walls give off dim light. 
Creatures. When any non-undead creature enters this 
area (which the Thayans avoid), a four-armed gargoyle 
(as a normal gargoyle with 63 hit points and one extra 
claw attack, for a total of three attacks, with Multiattack) 

--- PAGE 154 ---

emerges from a random pillar and attacks. ~ 
of each round thereafter, another random pt 
orms until all six gargoyles have emerged. 
Because the Red Wizards are drawing o he agic 
n this area to create stone golems, the ceiling i: c se 
o giving way. Whenever a gargoyle emer11e from a 
pillar, crumbling stone falls from the ceiling above ha 
pillar, making the area around the pillar difficult terrain. 
Any creature next to the pillar must succeed on a DC 
2 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) bludgeon­
·ng damage. 
Deva Statue. Anyone who succeeds on a DC 15 Imel­
. igence (Religion) check recognizes the statue as that 
of a deva. 
The last gargoyle to appear uses its initial action to 
·ouch the statue, which ends the curse that holds the 
-reature in stasis. This deva's name is Lumalia. After 
·he is freed, the walls shed bright light instead of dim. 
:-he deva shrieks, unable to act until her turn, at which 
point she attacks the nearest creatures. (The gargoyles 
a·,oid her.) 
A character who succeeds on a DC 13 Wisdom (In­
sight) check understands that the deva is crazed from 
-aptivity. The characters can try to influence her to 
direct her attacks against the gargoyles, but doing so 
·akes a successful DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check 
·o calm her and refocus her attention. Once she is lucid 
and able to talk to the characters, she vows to aid them 
y sowing chaos through the Doomvault on her own. 
Lumalia decides that her first task will be to inflict 
_ u tice upon the Thayans. She is immortal, but her 
anger and regret over the time she has lost during her 
mprisonment seems very humanlike. In the thick of 
combat, she can become lost in her thirst for vengeance 
n the current owners of the Doomvault. Lumalia was 
awful good when she was imprisoned, but she is now 
haotic good. 
Dungeon State. The magic of the Doomvault reso­
nates within Lumalia. She needs no glyph key to move 
hrough the magic gates in the dungeon , although she 
-an't take others with her. If she is freed, her resonance 
creates feedback in the gate system, making it harder to 
· nd intruders in the dungeon, and the Doomvault 's alert 
·eve! decreases by 1. 
White Gates. The corridor leading west has a white 
;;ate that connects with area 83 in the Blood Pools. In 
·he corridor to the south and west, a white gate leads to 
area 84 in the Blood Pools. 
93. STONE QUARRY 
,f the giants occupy this area, the sounds of their la­
bor are audible from either doorway even with the 
doors closed. 
A deep pit surrounded by loose rock and rubble scars the 
smooth marble floor of this chamber. A heavy rope de­
scending into the pit is connected to a system of winches 
and pulleys. LUMA.LIA, DEVA 
Creatures. One stone giant operates the pulley sys­
tem to haul stone out of the pit while a second giant cuts 
stone away from the pit walls. Both are occupied with 
their noisy work. 
The giants joined the Dread Legion willingly, but they 
hate their duties. Initially, they relish the chance to take 
their wrath out on the party, but they listen to offers of 
freedom. They need a glyph key to leave the dungeon. 
Pit. Filled with rubble, which is difficult terrain, the 
pit is 30 feet deep with rough, gently sloped sides. The 
ropes and pulleys above the pit are attached to a gigantic 
bucket used to transport the rock. It takes a successful 
DC 15 Strength check to raise the bucket when it is 
filled with stone. 
Rubble. The area within 10 feet of the pit is full of 
rock debris, so it is difficult terrain. 
94. GOLEM ASSEMBLY 
If the Thayans are here, the sounds of their labor are au­
dible from any open hallway leading into the room. 
White stones frame the four open archways that lead into 
this chamber. The four stones at the corners of each arch 
pulse with white light. The walls in this vast space are 
CHAPTER 5 DEAD IN fHAY 
153 

--- PAGE 155 ---

154 set with panels of copper that reflect the lights, revealing 
several piles of stone blocks on the floor. 
A contact stone is located in the eastern corner of 
the room. 
Glowing Archways. Any creature that steps through 
one of the four archways that open into this chamber is 
hurled 10 feet into the room. The first time a creature 
does so on a turn, the creature must also succeed on a 
DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 5 (2d4) force 
damage and fall prone. 
Touching any one of an archway's four glowing stones 
causes that stone to change color for 1 round. Number 
the stones from 1 to 4 and make the players specify 
which stones are touched. Select colors as you see fit, 
pretending to consult your notes each time. (The color 
changes have no effect on the encounter.) 
Creatures. A RP.rl Wizarrl transmuter (see appendix 
B) and two Thayan apprentices (see appendix B) are 
distracted by their work here shaping a reduced-threat 
stone golem (see "Reduced-Threat Monsters," page 
113), but they do notice if anyone is hurled into the 
room. These apprentices are armed with light hammers 
instead of daggers. The wizard can activate the golem 
by succeeding on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check 
made as an action. 
Stone Piles. The 3-foot-high piles of rough stone 
blocks are difficult terrain. 
Copper Panels. If a creature touches a copper panel, 
the creature takes 2 (ld4) lightning damage, and the 
archway stones flash. Until the end of the creature's next 
turn, it can pass through any archway in this room with­
out being pushed or taking damage. The Thayans know 
that touching a panel with a wooden item or some other 
nonconductor provides the benefit of the panel without 
causing damage. 
Treasure. Each Thayan has a fine chisel (worth 
50 gp). At the feet of the golem are a few jars of rare 
oils and boxes of rare powders. A character who suc­
ceeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check realizes 
that these materials, which weigh 10 pounds, are 
worth 2,500 gp. 
Glyph Key. The Red Wizard has a glyph key attuned 
to this zone. 
White Gates. The exits to the northwest and north­
east both hold white gates that connect with areas 90 
and 91 in the Clay Golem Kilns. The passage to the 
southeast has a white gate that leads to the Iron Golem 
Foundries. 
IRON GOLEM FOUNDRIES 
Deadly elemental fire fuels the creation of iron golems 
to serve the Red Wizards. The roar of flames is audible 
throughout this zone, and firelight provides illumination 
in many places. 
95. EFREET PRISON 
Characters approaching this area can hear the roar 
of flames. 
CHAPTER 5 I DEAD IN THAY • 
• o , round pool of molten material sits at the center of 
~~ s c amber. Tendrils of smoke curl up from it, moving 
natural ways. In three of the corners stand several 
·ed urns, most of them cracked and empty but a few still 
cosed and glowing with eldritch glyphs . 
Gout of Flame. A gout of flame blocks the passage 
that leads to area 97. A creature can jump over the flame 
easily but takes 2 (ld4) fire damage when doing so. A 
creature that enters the flame during its turn, or starts 
its turn there, takes 21 (6d6) fire damage. 
Creatures. An efreeti is bound to the smoke at the 
center of the room. It can't leave this area or use its pow­
ers against anyone outside the room. 
Binding Smoke. The smoke tendrils form chains 
that have no solidity, but their abjuration magic holds 
the efreeti in this area. While it is bound in this smoke, 
the creature is susceptible to the c11aim person spell 
and has disadvantage on the saving throw. If it isn't 
charmed, the efreeti orders anyone present to grant it 
freedom and attacks if its demand isn't met. 
The efreeti has no means to break the binding smoke. 
It knows, however, that the feat can be accomplished 
with spells, such as dispel magic (save DC 17), gust 
of wind, knock, or any spell that can push the efreeti 
out of the area of the pool. The smoke dissipates if the 
efreeti is slain. 
Molten Pool. The pool has a 3-foot-high wall. A crea­
ture that enters the pool for the first time on a turn, or 
starts its turn there, takes 35 (10d6) fire damage. 
Urns. Two unbroken funeral urns stand in each 
corner. Glyphs in the Primordial language on the urns 
suggest that they are binding vessels for efreet, and de­
tect magic reveals that they have an aura of abjuration. 
The wax-seal stopper of an urn is broken easily, and an 
urn can be broken like any clay vessel of the sort. When 
an urn is opened or broken, the act releases a gas that 
causes any creature within 10 feet of the urn to gain re­
sistance to fire damage for 1 hour. Each urn is 1 foot tall 
and weighs 5 pounds. 
Dungeon State. The magic of the Doomvault res­
onates within the efreeti, which has been here since 
before the Thayans came to power in the dungeon. It 
needs no glyph keys to move through the gates in the 
dungeon but can't enable others to accompany it. If it is 
freed, the efreeti rampages through the dungeon, prefer­
ring Thayan targets. 
White Gate. The opening on the northwest wall 
contains a white gate that connects with the Clay 
Golem Kilns. 
96. FIRE VORTEX 
I This rough cavern splits off from the smooth walls of the 
adjacent chamber. Its floor is covered in a layer of ash. 
Ash. Elemental ash covers the floor to a depth of 6 
inches, concealing how uneven the floor is. This entire 
area is difficult terrain. 

--- PAGE 156 ---

Cavern Walls. The extremely rough walls 
possible to traverse the cavern horizomallv .. ~ .... ,_ .. 
touching the floor. · 
Elemental Vortex. When any creature mm·e: on o 
the floor at the center of the cavern, the wall ddenlv 
erupt in a maelstrom of elemental fire that las , for 5 · 
rounds. Any creature that starts its turn in the cavern 
during this time must make a DC 15 Dexteritv sm·ina 
throw, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed a\·e. ;r 
half as much damage on a successful one. 
97. GOLEM FORGE 
• 
At the center of this fiery hall is a huge crucible that 
emits vapors. Dozens of molds and piles of armor plate 
are spread out before six hulking armored figures that 
stand along the walls. 
To the southwest is a black gate. North of the gate is a 
contact stone. 
Creatures. A Red Wizard conjurer (see appendix B) 
and two Thayan apprentices (see appendix B) work on 
an inactive iron golem in this area. 
A charmed efreeti (see area 95) is at work boiling 
metal in the crucible. The efreeti fights for its Thayan 
friends. If freed of the charmed condition, it snatches up 
a falchion intended for the golem and attacks the Thay­
ans. If the efreeti is alive when the other foes in the area 
are slain, it rampages like its kin in area 95. 
Crucible. The 5-foot-high crucible contains molten 
metal. As an action, a creature can attempt to spill the 
contents by tipping the crucible over, taking 21 (6d6) fire 
damage in the process. On a successful DC 15 Strength 
check, the crucible tips, and on a successful DC 20 
trength check, a creature can also push the crucible 
-feet before it tips. Molten metal quickly spreads from 
he mouth of the crucible over an area 30 feet by 30 feet 
in size, including the crucible and the space within 5 
·eet of it. 
Anyone caught in the molten metal takes 21 (6d6) fire 
damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution sav­
ing throw or fall prone. The floor of the area is covered 
in molten metal. For the next 5 rounds, a creature that 
enters the area for the first time on a turn, or starts its 
urn there, takes 10 (3d6) fire damage. For 5 rounds af-
ter that, the damage is 3 (ld6), and then it drops to none. 
Fire Vent. See area 95. 
Treasure. A search of the molds throughout the room 
reveals vials of rare tinctures and admixtures used 
in the construction of iron golems. A character who 
succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check real­
izes that these materials, which weigh 30 pounds, are 
worth 5,000 gp. 
Glyph Key. The Red Wizard has a glyph key attuned 
to this zone. 
White Gates. At the top of the stairs to the south is a 
white gate that connects with the Forest of Death. The 
corridor that leads northwest has a white gate that leads 
to the Stone Golem Quarries. TEMPLES OF EXTRACTION 
The so-called "Temples of Extraction" are profane 
laboratories that fuel Szass Tam's schemes for ascend­
ing to godhood. Szass Tam and his closest associates 
have reshaped this sector's magic to collect the divine 
essence of the Chosen of various deities. The Thayan 
regent believes that this essence may be the key to be­
coming a god. 
Locations in the Temples of Extraction are identified 
on map 5.11. 
Creatures. The Thayans here are the most loyal and 
fanatical servants of Szass Tam. They all know that no 
one is authorized to be in this sector, so the characters 
have a hard time fooling them. Except for the cowardly 
Red Wizard Shalok (area 103), the Thayans in this sec­
tor are unlikely to surrender and are unwilling to help 
intruders even at the cost of their lives. 
The Red Wizards in this sector might feign surrender 
to put the characters off their guard. For example, they 
might fall to their knees and hold up their hands. Then, 
when the characters close in, the wizards cast area 
spells that include themselves and the party. 
If a shrine of binding (see below) exudes a magical ef­
fect to which creatures in the room can become inured, 
the creatures that guard the shrine are already immune 
to the effect. 
Doors. All the doors in this sector are locked. 
Random Encounters. No random encounters occur 
in the Temples of Extraction. 
Black Gates. Only four external glyph keys (one for 
each zone, in areas 10, 25, 31, and 63) allow access to 
the gates in this sector. Some Red Wizards here carry 
glyph keys to their zones and guard them zealously. 
Contact Stones. There are no contact stones in 
this sector. 
SHRINES OF BINDING 
Each chamber of this zone features an identical 3-foot­
high shrine whose arcane power extracts energy from 
a Chosen creature that is strapped to the shrine. This 
energy is what powers the Doomvault but, even more, is 
also what both creates and keeps hidden the Phylactery 
Vault. The characters will have to examine the shrines 
to determine how these abilities function. 
When the characters see a shrine of binding for the 
first time, use the following description. 
A three-step stone dais is set with four pillars, all carved 
of black jet. Glowing arcane runes surround the top edge 
of this shrine. Between the pillars, an unconscious hu­
manoid is suspended in a roiling field of golden light. 
Thereafter , you can shorten the description of the 
shrine, but be sure to specifically describe the Chosen 
that is bound inside it. 
Entering a Shrine. While there is someone trapped 
on the shrine, the whole structure is surrounded by a 
tangible magical energy. Stepping onto the shrine re-

MAP 5.11: TEMPLES OF EXTRACTION 
quires a successful DC 10 Charisma check, and unless 
this check succeeds by 5 or more, the shrine counts 
as difficult terrain. On a failed check, the creature is 
knocked prone next to the shrine and takes 5 (2d4) 
force damage. 
Effects of a Shrine. Channeling the energy of the 
trapped Chosen, each shrine creates magical effects 
and light within its area (see each area descriptions for 
details) and throughout the complex-in particular they 
help to obfuscate the location of the Phylactery Vault. 
A successful DC 10 Wisdom check allows a character 
to intuit the effects of a working shrine, including how 
it channels the life essence of the trapped Chosen to 
another place and how to disable it. When a shrine is 
disabled, its magical effect in the area ends, and the 
Chosen bound inside it is freed. 
Disabling a Shrine. The process for disabling a 
shrine is the same in each area. Characters who are 
standing on the shrine may disable its magic by mak­
ing three successful DC 15 ability checks: Strength to 
smash the pillars, Dexterity to remove elements and 
disable key arcane runes, or Intelligence to disrupt the 
flow of magical energy. A character can make multiple 
CHAPTER 5 I DEAD IN THAY c· ec · of the same type or any combination. On any 
=ailed check, the character who attempted the check is 
p shed off the shrine and knocked prone next to it, tak­
ing -2d4) force damage. 
Reaching the Phylactery Vault. Once a Shrine of 
Binding has been disabled, a character who closely 
examines the shrine and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelli­
gence 1Arcana) check discerns how these shrines and 
the black gates in this sector work together to shield the 
Phylactery Vault. The character understands that if the 
black gates in the Temples of Extraction can be over­
loaded, those gates will attune themselves to the loca­
tion where the power of the Chosen is being directed­
the vault itself. 
In order to create that overload, six black gates in 
other sectors must be disrupted simultaneously (as de­
scribed at the beginning of this adventure). Once that is 
accomplished, any glyph key can be used on any of the 
black gates in the Temples of Extraction, and the user 
will hP. t<1kPn tn thP Phyl<1rtPryV<111lt 
THE CHOSEN 
In each area of the Temples of Extraction, one of the 
Chosen of the gods is being drained to grant power to 
Szass Tam. Some of these Chosen would be deadly 
adversaries, but the binding ordeal leaves most of them 
physically and mentally weakened to the point that they 
pose no real danger. The Chosen have no memory of 
how they came to be in the Doomvault, so they can offer 
no information about the dungeon. 
Many of the helpless Chosen are thoroughly evil, 
and good-aligned characters might balk at seeing them 
freed. Take advantage of this situation to create opportu­
nities for interesting interactions. 
If combat statistics become necessary, a helpless Cho­
sen has AC 10, has 5 hit points, and makes checks and 
saving throws with a +O modifier. If you plan to use this 
adventure in a continuing campaign, killing a helpless 
Chosen can later bring the characters into conflict with 
other agents of that Chosen's deity. 
The magic of the Doomvault resonates within all 
of the Chosen. A Chosen needs no glyph key to move 
through the gates in the dungeon, although that individ­
ual can't enable others to accompany it. 
TEMPLES OF ANGUISH 
The Chosen of deities who are associated with torment 
have been imprisoned in these chambers. 
98. TEMPLE OF POISON 
The air in this white marble chamber hangs heavy 
with a dark mist that burns the eyes. To the north is a 
black gate. 
Creatures. A Red Wizard necromancer (see appen­
dix B) works here, guarded by a helmed horror. They 
are immune to the Dark Mist, and the Red Wizard has 
the Venomous Touch trait (see below). 

--- PAGE 158 ---

Dark Mist. The shrine exudes poisonou-­
makes the area lightly obscured. Any crea u 
tarts its turn in the room must succeed on a DC 15 
Constitution saving throw or become tunned il the 
start of its next turn. If the save succeeds. the c ea ure 
immune to this effect for a day and gain the following 
rait. Constructs and undead can't gain thi trai . 
Venomous Touch. When the creature hits with a ea;)o a::ac . 
:nat attack also deals 5 (2d4) poison damage. 
Chosen ofZehir. The Chosen of Zehir is a male 
yuan-ti malison (type 3) named Oussa. Zehir is the 
serpentine god of poison, darkness , and murder. He is 
·vorshiped primarily by yuan-ti. If Oussa is rescued and 
·hen realizes that the characters aren't Zehir's faithful 
·ent to help him, he uses his unholy power to instantly 
assume snake form and attacks the party. 
Glyph Key. The Red Wizard has a glyph key attuned 
o this zone. 
99. TEMPLE OF SUFFERING 
Stripes of red mist appear in the air in this white marble 
chamber, as if someone is whipping the air and it is 
bleeding. 
Creatures. A Red Wizard enchanter and a Thayan 
apprentice work here, guarded by two dread warriors 
ee appendix B for all three stat blocks). 
The Red Wizard here is Mennek Ariz, the rebel wiz­
ard who helped assault the Bloodgate. He was captured 
during the assault and brainwashed. A character who 
·ucceeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check can dis­
cern that he isn't acting of his own volition. Only magic, 
·uch as dispel magic or charm person, can break the 
effect. If he is freed of the brainwashing , Mennek can 
~eveal two pieces of lore. 
Suffering Aura. Whenever a creature in this room 
deals damage to one or more creatures, it must make a 
DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. If the saving throw fails, 
·he attacker takes radiant damage equal to one-quarter 
of the greatest amount of damage it dealt to a single tar­
get. If the save succeeds, the attacker instead regains a 
number of hit points equal to one-quarter of the greatest 
amount of damage it dealt to a single target. 
Chosen ofllmater. The Chosen of Ilmater is a lawful 
good male human named Kieren. Ilmater, also known 
as the Crying God, is the god of suffering , martyrdom , 
and perseverance. He offers succor and calming words 
o those who are in pain, oppressed , or in great need. 
Treasure. Mennek carries a wand of binding. 
Keys. Mennek has a glyph key attuned to this zone, 
as well as a skeleton key that unlocks all the doors in 
his zone. 
White Gates. Behind the doors to the south i a white 
gate that leads to the Temples of Turmoil. The eastern 
doors open onto a white gate that connect with the 
Temples of Oppression. MENNEK, RED W11ARD ENCHANTER 
100. TEMPLE OF PAIN 
I A tangible feeling of unease and discomfort fills the air of I 
this scarred marble chamber. 
Creatures. A deathlock wight (see appendix B) keeps 
watch here. One wraith and four shadows circle around 
the shrine, streaks of crimson trailing from their spec­
tral forms. 
Web of Pain. Whenever a non-undead creature in this 
area takes damage, it must make a DC 15 Constitution 
saving throw. On a failed save, the creature makes at­
tack rolls, Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and 
ability checks with disadvantage until the end of its next 
turn. In addition, others make attack rolls against the 
creature with advantage until the end of its next turn. 
Chosen ofLoviatar. The Chosen of Loviatar is a 
lawful evil female half-elf named Irisoth. Loviatar, the 
Maiden of Pain, is the god of hurt and agony, and the pa­
tron of torturers. Loviatar teaches that the world is filled 
with pain and torment, and the best that one can do is to 
suffer those blows that can't be avoided, and then deal 
as much pain back to those who offend.

TEMPLES OF OPPRESSION 
The dark of living night and deadly abominations fuels 
the shrines in the Temples of Oppression. 
101. TEMPLE OF OOZE 
I The walls in this hexagonal hall of gleaming gray marble I 
shudder occasionally. To the northeast is a black gate. 
Creatures. A Red Wizard transmuter (see appendix 
B) works here, with a wight leading two sentient gray 
oozes and two sentient ochre jellies to guard her. Sen­
tient oozes are the same as normal versions of such 
monsters, except that they have Intelligence 5, can un­
derstand basic communication in Common , and are no 
longer immune to being charmed. Myrra, the Red Wiz­
ard, is especially cruel and likely to toy with the charac­
ters even when she is losing. 
Ooze Walls. The first time a creature moves within 15 
feet of any wall on a turn, that act provokes an opportu­
nity attack as if made by a gray ooze with a reach of 15 
feet. The attack roll is made with advantage. 
Chosen ofGhaunadaur. The Chosen of Ghaunadaur 
is a sickly and chaotic evil male drow named Therzt. 
Ghaunadaur is a strange god worshiped primarily by 
male drow that seek power outside the confines of a so­
ciety dominated by females. Ghaunadaur is a malignant 
and unknowable deity that desires living sacrifice and 
destruction due to monstrous causes, particularly oozes. 
If he is freed, Therzt babbles about the weakness he 
demonstrated in being captured and declares that he 
must die. As an action, Therzt casts Me/f's acid arrow 
on himself while screaming his devotion to Ghaunadaur. 
The acid consumes him utterly as unholy energy pulses 
out to touch the walls, producing two gray oozes at the 
center point of each wall. The oozes treat all creatures 
remaining here as prey. 
Keys. The Red Wizard has a glyph key attuned to this 
zone, as well as a skeleton key that unlocks all the doors 
in this zone. 
White Gate. Beyond the doors to the west is a white 
gate that leads to the Temples of Anguish. 
102. TEMPLE OF SHADOWS 
Light. This area has no light sources. Bright light 
from a source other than a spell of 3rd level or higher 
becomes dim light if it is produced in or carried into 
this chamber. 
I The shrine of binding takes up a large portion of this I 
black marble chamber. 
Creatures. Six shadows lurk here. 
Poisoned Shadows. Whenever a non-undead creature 
in this area takes damage, it must make a DC 15 Wis­
dom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 
5 (2d4) poison damage, and it is blinded for 1 minute. A 
creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each 
of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. 
CHAPTER 5 I DEAD TN THAY Chosen oflbrandul. The Chosen of Ibrandul is a cha-
o ic evil female drow named Ashdra. Ibrandul is a god of 
darkness and underground places once primarily wor­
shiped by humans in southern lands such as Calimshan . 
He was worshiped as a comforter and protector of those 
who travel and work in darkness. 
White Gate. The doors to the south open onto a cor­
ridor that runs southwest and joins with two other pas­
sages. At the junction is a white gate that connects with 
the Temples of Turmoil and with the Temples of Nature. 
TEMPLES OF TURMOIL 
The magic of Szass Tam turns different facets of chaos 
to absolute evil in these great halls. 
103. TEMPLE OF FORTUNE 
l A pattern of shadow swirls around a shrine of binding 
l and plays out across the white-and-gold marble floor of 
this hall. To the west is a black gate. 
Creatures. A Red Wizard necromancer (see appen­
dix B) works here, guarded by a flesh golem. Shalok, 
the Red Wizard, is a coward. If the fight goes badly for 
him, he surrenders. He offers his skeleton key and one 
piece of lore if he's allowed to flee to the gatehouse. 
Curse of Fortune. High and low d20 results matter 
more in this area: 
A creature that rolls a natural 1 on an attack roll takes 
the damage from its attack. 
, A creature that scores a critical hit can roll the extra 
damage die twice instead of just once. 
, A creature that rolls a 1 on a saving throw suffers 
the worst possible effect, such as maximum damage 
from a spell. 
If a creature rolls a 20 on a saving throw, the creator 
of the effect that caused the saving throw suffers the 
effect instead. 
, If a creature rolls a 1 on an ability check, it suffers the 
worst possible outcome of the attempted action. 
, If a creature rolls a 20 on an ability check, it ac­
complishes a particularly spectacular and favor­
able outcome. 
Chosen ofTymora. The Chosen of Tymora is a cha­
otic good male halfling named Curran Corvalin. Tymora 
is the goddess of good fortune, skill, and victory. She is 
the patron of all who take risks. Although considered to 
be a good deity who favors those who take bold action, 
she is also seen as somewhat capricious. 
Curran was captured by the Red Wizards a few weeks 
ago. He never considered himself to be a Chosen of Ty­
mora, since he never had any special powers. He alway 
just assumed he had unnaturally good luck. 
Curran is eager to return home, but he is too weak to 
help the party. If taken to the gatehouse, he awaits the 
party's triumph there. 
Keys. Shalok has a glyph key attuned to this zone, 
as well as a skeleton key that unlocks all the doors in 
this zone.

104. TEMPLE OF SAVAGERY 
• • 
This chamber of red marble rings with the a g sc:rea s 
of humanoids. The sounds arouse fee lings o~ o e ce. 
Creatures. A Red Wizard evoker (see appendi.,;: B) 
• as command over two dread warriors (see appendi.,;: 
B) here. A shadow lurks at each pillar on the shrine of 
binding, for a total of four. 
Curse ofBJoodlust. If combat occurs in this area. 
a. creature takes 5 (2d4) psychic damage at the end of 
each of its turns when it doesn't deal damage to an­
other creature. 
Curse of Betrayal. Any creature that ends its turn in 
mis area must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. 
• · the saving throw fails, the creature treats all other 
reatures as enemies for the purpose of opportunity 
attacks and makes any opportunity attack available to 
. with advantage on the attack roll, until the end of the 
creature's next turn. It can use no other reactions during 
dlis time. 
Chosen ofBhaal. This shrine contains a Chosen of 
Bhaal named Torlin Silvershield , who was formerly 
a duke of Baldur's Gate. He has become a wight. The 
·reature hisses an oath to Bhaal and attacks characters 
·ho free it. 
Bhaal is the Lord of Murder and a patron of assassins. 
White Gate. The doors on the eastern wall open onto 
a corridor that joins with two other passages. At the 
_unction is a white gate that connects with the Temples 
of Oppression and with the Temples of Nature. 
TEMPLES OF NATURE 
:-he power of nature is stripped down to its most de­
·tructive core in this zone. 
05. TEMPLE OF PLAGUE 
A glowing green mist drifts around a shrine of binding 
,n this white marble chamber. To the southwest is a 
black gate. 
Creatures. A Red Wizard necromancer (see appen­
dix B) and a deathlock wight (see appendix B) work 
· ere, guarded by a dread warrior (see appendix B) and 
our zombies. Thutai, the Red Wizard, is the overseer of 
:.his sector. He cares little for his underling s, including 
dlem in area effects if it means harming more charac­
·ers. If the fight goes badly, he uses the black gate to flee. 
Curse of Death. Characters have disadvantage on 
death saving throws while in this area. 
Plague Mist. The shrine exudes poisonous mist that 
makes the area lightly obscured . Each creature that 
starts its turn in the room must make a DC 13 Constitu­
·ion saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5 
2d4) poison damage and spends its turn incapacita ted 
and retching. If a creature accumulates three failed 
·aves against this mist, its hit point maximum i low­
ered by the amount of poison damage it ha taken from the mist. A creature that makes three successful saving 
throws against the mist becomes immune to its effects 
for 4 hours. 
Chosen ofYurtrus. The Chosen of Yurtrus is a neu­
tral evil male ore named Bandagh . Yurtrus is the ore 
deity of disease, decay, rot, and death. Ores fear Yurtrus, 
and his priests have protected status in the tribe even 
though they are often weak or infirm in some way. Ban­
dagh is pockmarked from years of disease, and is in no 
condition to pick a fight if he is freed. 
Treasure. Thutai wears bracers of defense and has 
spell scrolls of remove curse and speak with dead. 
Keys. Thutai has a glyph key attuned to every zone in 
this sector, as well as a skeleton key that unlocks all the 
doors in this zone. 
White Gate. The doors on the western wall open onto 
a corridor that joins with two other passages. At the 
junction is a white gate that connects with the Temples 
of Oppression and with the Temples of Turmoil. 
106. TEMPLE OF THE FOREST 
Gnarled vines thrust from the rough floor of this green 
cavern, and roots dangle from the ceiling. The vines 
move as if in a breeze, though you feel no such thing. 
Creatures. A wraith and three will-o'-wisps guard 
this chamber. The wisps start out invisible. 
Clutching Vines. While on the ground, a creature that 
moves more than half its speed or misses with a melee 
attack causes the branches within 5 feet to elongate and 
grasp. Each creature on the ground in the area must 
succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or become 
restrained in the vines. The area becomes difficult ter­
rain. A restrained creature can take an action to make a 
DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself on a success. 
Chosen ofRillifane Rallathil. A neutral good female 
wood elf druid named Eira is the Chosen of Rillifane 
Rallathil , the elven god of the woodlands and of the har­
mony of nature. He is seen as a calm and steady deity, 
quite unlike his more mercurial fellow elven deities. 
As part of the experiments in this sector, Eira has 
been infused with the essence of a Chosen of Talona 
who was sacrificed. The binding process has left Eira 
at half her hit points but otherwise in good shape. She 
begs to accompany the characters in the fight against 
the Red Wizards. 
If Eira joins the party, when she enters combat, the 
Talona side surfaces and contests for control. She ar­
gues out loud with herself, and half the time she acts 
evilly and without concern for her saviors. While talking 
to herself, she reveals what happened to her as well as 
one piece of lore. If Eira drops to O hit points, she disin­
tegrates, her body turning to ash. 
107. TEMPLE OF WINTER 
I A blast of freezing air comes through the open doors to 
this chamber, where the walls are covered with ice. I 
CHAPTER '5 I DEAD IN THAY 159

160 Creatures. A Red Wizard evoker (see appendix B) 
and a Thayan apprentice (see appendix B) work here, 
with three trained yetis as bodyguards. Aduna, the 
Red Wizard, and her apprentice prefer to stand near 
the braziers. 
Braziers. The magic stone braziers are built into the 
room and can't be moved. A creature that touches a bra­
zier for the first time on a turn takes 3 (ld6) fire damage. 
Chill Metal Aura. A creature within 10 feet of a bra­
zier ignores this effect. Any other creature wielding a 
metal weapon or wearing metal armor must succeed on 
a DC 13 Constitution saving throw at the start of each 
of its turns or take 5 (2d4) cold damage. If the saving 
throw fails by 5 or more, the creature has disadvantage 
on Strength- and Dexterity-based attack rolls, ability 
checks, and saving throws until the start of its next turn. 
Chosen of Auril. The Chosen of Auril is a chaotic evil 
female human named Hedrun Arnsfirth. Auril is a cal­
lous and cold-hearted bringer of winter. Most humans 
propitiate Auril with offerings or prayers when the first 
frosts come and curse her name during blizzards. 
Hedrun is now a deathlock wight (see appendix B). 
If freed, she screams an oath to Auril and attacks the 
characters. 
Treasure. Aduna wears a robe of summer (see 
appendix A). 
Keys. Aduna has a glyph key attuned to this zone, 
as well as a skeleton key that unlocks all the doors in 
this zone. 
THE PHYLACTERYVAULT 
Once the characters disrupt six black gates throughout 
the dungeon, they can use the gates in the Temples of 
Extraction to travel to the Phylactery Vault. Before they 
make that journey, Syranna uses sending to call the 
characters back to the gatehouse and brief them on their 
final task. Syranna interacts with the party as follows: 
Syranna's image appears before you and speaks. 
"Hello again," she says. "I confess that I'm surprised at 
how well you have persevered . Your actions have signifi­
cantly disrupted activity in the Doomvault. But the task is 
not yet complete. 
"You have a chance to deal a heavy blow to Szass Tam 
and the liches ofThay. The black gates have been dis­
rupted, allowing entry into a chamber deep beneath the 
Doomvault. Accessible only by magic, this room is called 
the Phylactery Vault because it houses the phylacteries of 
many of Szass Tam's high-ranking lich servants. 
"You must enter the vault, defeat its guardians, and 
disrupt the magic there. You can enter through any black 
gate in the Temples of Extraction when you are ready." 
The characters can ask questions, but at best Syranna 
knows only a little more than they do. (You can use this 
opportunity to give out information you want the players 
to know before proceeding.) 
CHAPTER 5 I DEAD IN THAY E.l TERING THE VAULT 
The Phylactery Vault is a tetrahedral space-like stand­
ing inside a hollow pyramid-and the characters are 
inside that space when they arrive. Each face of the vault 
has its own gravity. In effect, every surface is a floor. See 
the "Gravity" section for more details. 
~faps 5.12 and 5.13 depict the inside of the Phylactery 
\'ault and indicate how those floors connect with the 
other surfaces. The characters arrive on floor 1. 
Begin by describing the area: 
The vast, four-sided pyramidal space has a floor of 
rough-hewn white marble set with low circular pedestals 
of the same material. At the three corners of the floor 
stand sepulchers of white marble, each a three-sided pyr­
amid that mirrors the shape of the vault. Engraved into 
each sepulcher's double doors is a four-armed gargoyle, 
poised to attack. A pooi of dark liquid churns in the cen­
ter of the floor. 
Each other surface of the vault is nearly identical. Rub­
ble of black rock scattered near the wall and the pool on 
each side stay in place. It seems apparent that each side 
has its own gravity. 
Make sure the players understand the relative gravity of 
each floor. 
Adjacent Floors. The directions that lead to 
other floors in the vault are indicated on the map for 
floors 1 and 2. 
If the characters are on floor 3, they can reach floor 1 
by traveling north, floor 4 by going southwest, and floor 
1 by traveling southeast. 
If the characters are on floor 4, they can reach floor 3 
by traveling south, floor 1 by going northwest, and floor 
2 by traveling northeast. 
GENERAL FEATURES 
Each floor inside the Phylactery Vault has the follow­
ing features. 
Dark Pools. A dark pool is 1 foot deep and difficult 
terrain. Any creature that starts its turn in a dark pool 
takes 9 (2d8) necrotic damage. A creature in a dark pool 
can't regain hit points. 
Pedestals. The 3-foot-high pedestals store radiant 
energy, which is released in the presence of undead in­
truders. If an undead creature other than Kazit Gui end 
its turn within 5 feet of a pedestal, the creature must 
succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or take 11 
(2d10) radiant damage. 
Rubble Piles. Along the edge of each floor, a pile of 
loose chunks of black marble rises to a height of 3 feet 
as it crosses to the adjacent floor. This rubble is diffi­
cult terrain. 
Sepulchers. The double doors to these tetrahedral 
pyramids are locked (requiring a successful DC 17 
Dexterity check to pick the lock or a successful DC 20 
Strength check to burst it). If either of the two doors 
on a sepulcher is opened, each door on that sepulcher

Within each sepulcher is a set of phylae e ·e­
"Phylacteries" section. 
GRAVITY 
Each floor in the vault's tetrahedral space ha it own 
gravity. This phenomenon also has the following effect 
Flying. A creature flying from one floor to land on 
another must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) 
check or fall prone upon landing. 
Ranged Attacks. Due to the weird gravity. creatures 
have disadvantage on ranged attack rolls made against 
targets on a different floor. 
Moving between Floors. The edges of the tetrahe­
dron are lined with piles of rubble. Crossing to the 
rubble pile onto an adjacent floor requires a successful 
DC 13 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) 
check. On a failed check, the creature falls prone in that 
rubble pile. 
PHYLACTERIES 
Within each sepulcher is a scene like the following: 
• The sepulcher walls hum with arcane power. On stone 
shelves are leather cases, amulets, daggers, scroll tubes, 
unholy symbols, and other ornate objects. These are the 
phylacteries of Szass Tam's lich servants . 
The phylacteries can't be harmed while they are pro­
tected by the magic of the sepulcher. However, a suc­
cessful DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check made while 
examining a sepulcher reveals that disrupting the flow 
of eldritch energy within a sepulcher will disable the 
structure. 
Disrupting the energy flow requires intense concen­
tration. It takes three successful DC 15 Intelligence 
Arcana or Religion) checks performed by a character 
who is proficient in that skill and is touching the target 
epulcher. On each failed check, the character takes 
force damage equal to the amount by which the check 
failed. After making one check, a character realizes that 
every glyph key he or she holds will grant a +l bonus to 
the check. 
When the group disables its first sepulcher, read: 
Fountains of shadowy energy burst from the dark 
pools to form an inky vortex in the open air at the 
vault's center. 
A gleaming black humanoid skull flies out of the vor­
tex. It has a ruby in each of its eye sockets and eight over­
sized glowing diamonds in place of teeth. KAZIT GuL 
Kazit Gui, a demilich, has entered the vault and im­
mediately attacks the characters. If the demilich is de­
stroyed, read: 
j The skull turns to black ash that floats away, and the 1 eight gems embedded in it fall to the ground. 
The gems that contain souls gleam with inner light. If 
such a gem is crushed, the soul is released. The soul de­
parts for the afterlife unless its body is intact and within 
10 feet of the crushed gem. 
ENDGAME 
In order to destroy the Phylactery Vault, first Kazit Gui 
must be destroyed, and then three sepulchers must be 
disabled. When those conditions are met, the magic 
coursing through the Phylactery Vault unravels: 
The white pedestals crumble to rubble and the dark 
pools dissipate, leaving behind black ash. The vortex 
overhead collapses, spilling black ash and diamonds 
onto the floor. Your glyph keys pulse with blue light and 
subtle vibrations. The black gates begin to pulse in time 
with the keys. 
A character can make a DC 13 Intelligence (Arcana) 
check to assess the failing magic and confirm that the 
Phylactery Vault is collapsing. l 
If all eight of the demilich's gems have been destroyed 
when the Phylactery Vault begins to collapse, then Kazit 
Gui is permanently slain. The characters can hear a dis­
tant wail and sense Gui's passing. 
At this juncture, the characters ' glyph keys allow them 
to use any black gates to escape this quickly collapsing 
extradimensional space, but the only place they can go 
is the gatehouse. 
AFTERMATH 
With the Phylactery Vault destroyed , Syranna is true 
to her word and uses teleport to send the characters 
(as well as any NPCs they saved from the Doomvault) 
to a location of their choice. She invites any charac-
ters who proved useful, particularly those with arcane 
talents, to remain in Thay under her leadership . She 
promises them power and influence if they throw in sup­
port for her. 
Any fallen characters who were raised as soul-bound 
undead can't leave the Doomvault without dying perma­
nently. Syranna assures such characters who choose to 
stay that she will see that they are restored to life, once 
she gains sufficient power to do so. lt 
CHAPTER 5 DEAD IN THAY 

--- PAGE 166 ---

AGAI ST THE GIANTS 
IANTS HAVE BEEN RAIDING Cl\ ILIZED 
lands in bands, with giants of different 
sorts in these marauding group . Death 
and destruction have been laid hem·ily 
upon every place these monster have 
visited. This has caused great anger in 
high places, for life and property loss 
means failure of the vows of noble rulers to protect the 
life and goods of each and every subject-and possible 
lean times for the rulers as well as the ruled. Therefore, 
a party of the bravest and most powerful adventurers 
has been assembled and given the charge to punish the 
miscreant giants. Characters whose homes lay in the 
devastated land probably need little more motivation to 
face their oppressors. 
The first stage of the characters' mission is an infiltra­
tion and assault of the Steading of the Hill Giant Chief. 
From there, if they succeed, the adventurers can ad­
vance to test their mettle against the even more formida­
ble giants of frost and fire, but that is of no concern right 
now-the steading awaits, and its perils are plentiful. 
RUNNING THE ADVENTURES 
This is a series of three linked adventures. It is designed 
for a group of four or five player characters of 11th level. 
If the characters persevere, they are likely to advance in 
level at the end of each section of the story. Only strong 
and experienced characters should adventure into these 
giants' areas if the party consists of no more than four 
characters. The characters should have magic items 
to help them overcome the challenges they face. For a 
small party, the most important qualities are experience 
and caution. A group of four well-played characters can 
expect a reasonable chance of survival if they use their 
knowledge and cunning to best advantage. 
These adventures were designed for strategic play, so 
some areas of the giant settlements are very dangerous 
even for characters of the recommended level. Further, 
adventurers who call too much attention to themselves 
are likely to be doomed. It takes only one or two extra gi­
ants in an encounter to turn a manageable situation into 
a very deadly one. 
Therefore, be free with information the players need 
to make informed decisions . For example, any seasoned 
adventurer can see that the giants in the great hall of 
the steading represent an overwhelming challenge. So, 
the question becomes how to accomplish punishing the 
giants and discovering what is influencing them without 
having to face so many at once. The adventure contains 
some possible answers. 
Keep track of the fate of important giant and their 
allies or captives. Escaping adversaries will generally 
flee to the next higher-ranking stronghold from the 
steading to the rift and from the rift to nu,re·s hall): freed captives may join forces with their rescuers (this is 
a good way to introduce replacement player characters) . 
This assumes survival of the individuals, of course, as 
well as opportunity for them to act. Some provision for 
the movement of surviving giants is given in the latter 
scenarios, but you will have to modify these according 
to the outcome of previous adventuring by your group. 
CUSTOMIZING THE GIANTS 
If you want to add some variability to the encounters in 
these adventures, a good way to do this is by modifying 
the armor and weapons the giants use. In particular, the 
servants and the young that are found among the giants 
might not be outfitted with the gear described in the 
statistics used for them. Servants could use improvised 
weapons, such as giant-sized tools and utensils they 
have available. If you decide to change any giant's melee 
weapon to some other giant-sized weapon, adjust its 
damage accordingly: Huge giants deal three times nor­
mal weapon damage, and Large giants, such as ogres, 
deal twice normal weapon damage. 
When a giant uses the statistics of an ogre, that crea­
ture might use throwing rocks for ranged attacks (as­
suming any are on hand) rather than the ogre's standard 
weaponry. If projectiles are available, throwing rocks is 
always a giant's best (and preferred) ranged attack. 
GIANTS ' BAGS 
Many opportunities arise throughout these adventures 
for the characters to search miscellaneous bags and 
PLACING THE ADVENTURES 
The preferred habitats of hill giants, frost giants, and 
fire giants exist in virtually every D&D setting, so it's not 
too difficult to find locations for the strongholds and the 
events in Against the Giants. 
Dragonlance. On Krynn, the alliance of giants could 
center on the Kharolis Mountains, bringing Abanasinia, 
Qualinesti, Thorbardin, Kharolis, and Tarsis into the con­
flict. The ultimate villains in the Dragon lance setting would 
have to be dark exiles of an even more unexpected sort 
than those described in this adventure. 
Eberron. The giant conspiracy could have its roots in 
faraway Xen'drik, with an outpost in Breland serving as the 
hill giant steading. Or the giants could be from Droaam, 
perhaps acting against the wishes of the Daughters of Sora 
Kell due to another sinister influence . 
Forgotten Realms. In Faerun, the giants could be raiding 
the Sword Coast after emerging from the Sword Moun­
tains or the Sunset Mountains or the Spine of the World. 
They might be preparing to move on Damara from out of 
the Galena Mountains, or to descend upon the Dalelands 
and Cormyr from the Stormhorns or the Thunder Peaks. 
Greyhawk. The giants might threaten Geoff, Sterich, 
or other nearby realms from out of the Crystalmists, the 
Jotens, or even the infamous Barrier Peaks.

STEADING OF THE HILL 
GIANT CHIEF 
To send them off with every possible advantage, patrons 
outfit the characters with all standard items needed for 
both wilderness and dungeon exploration; and each 
member of the party has likewise been given the finest 
horse available. Guides are available to help, and the 
ABOUT THE ORIGINAL party has a splendid map showing the exact location of 
i:he great timber fortress of the chief of the hill giants. 
This chief, one Nosnra, is a grossly fat and thoroughly 
de picable creature, sly and vicious, loving ambush and 
back-stabbing. Furthermore, the party has been cau­
tioned to expect a secret force, some motivational power 
behind this unusual banding of different races of giants. 
Finally, the party has been instructed to keep any and 
all loot they chance upon, this being their reward for 
the perils they are to face. They are to follow any clues 
that point toward the sinister hand suspected of guiding 
the uprising, but are to return at once if they determine 
exactly the reason or force behind the unholy alliance. 
Some relic of great evil might be at hand. 
RUNNING THE ADVENTURE 
There is considerable information contained herein 
with respect to what the players see as they explore the 
steading , and what the inhabitants do if they become 
aware of the intruders. This does not mean that you, as 
Dungeon Master, must surrender your creativity and 
become a mere script reader. You will have to make 
up certain details for areas and items that characters 
thoroughly examine and explore. There will inevitably 
be player actions which the script has not anticipated, 
and you will have to judge their results. Finally, you can 
amend and alter monsters and treasures as you see 
fit, with an eye towards your home campaign and your 
particular players. If time permits, the giants organize 
traps, ambushes, and last-ditch defenses against con­
tinuing forays into their stronghold. 
ADVENTURE START 
It is assumed that the party has safely arrived at a spot 
near the giants' stronghold -a small cave, well hidden, 
where they can hide mounts and equipment. They come 
to the place of the giants just at dusk. No windows are 
visible, nor can giants or any other creatures be seen 
about the place, although occasional bursts of shouting 
and laughter can be heard faintly from within. The char­
acters have been warned to expect guards at the great 
doors to the steading , but none are visible. (If the party 
returns to the stronghold after an initial foray, there will 
Against the Giants, by Gary Gygax, 
was originally produced in 1981 as 
a compilation of three adventures 
written in the earliest days of the 
game. Those adventures were 
created and originally released in 
1978, during the time when Gary Gygax was still writing the Player's 
Handbook for the original AD&D 
game. Despite being (in a sense) 
older than the game itself, these ad­
ventures continue to hold a special 
place in the hearts and memories of 
D&D players of all ages .

UPPER WORKS: GENERAL FEATURES 
:vlap 6.1 shows the layout of the huge timber stronghold 
of the local clan of hill giants. All outer walls are of logs 
at least 3 feet in diameter. Inner walls dividing rooms 
are about 2 feet thick. All inside floors are of stone. 
The steading is in a nasty, damp area, where hard rain 
is a daily occurrence and wet fog a nightly event. As a 
result, all wood in the place is very damp and difficult to 
set aflame. 
Ceilings. Ceiling height varies from about 16 feet at 
the edges to 32 feet at the center, the roof being held up 
by great, smoke-blackened rafters. The open yard (area 
22) has no roof. 
Doors. Doors are great iron-bound log affairs 1 foot in 
thickness, each about 7 feet wide and 16 to 18 feet high. 
A Medium or smaller creature must succeed on a DC 
10 Strength (Athletics) check to open any of the doors 
on the upper level due to their great size and weight. 
Doors stay open if left that way. 
Illumination. Fireplaces are indicated on the map, 
but the locations of other light sources such as cressets 
and braziers are not. 
Secret Doors. Secret doors in the upper level of the 
stronghold are relatively easy to find due to the crude 
construction of the place. It requires a successful DC 12 
Wisdom (Perception) check to find such a door. 
RANDOM ENCOUNTERS 
On the upper level of the stronghold, the chance of a 
random encounter occurs on an hourly basis. At the end 
of each hour, roll a d6. On a roll of 1, which indicates a 
random encounter, consult the section below that corre­
sponds to the characters' current location. 
Entryway and Long Corridor. If the characters are 
in area 1 or in the corridor that leads to area 11, choose 
from the following possibilities: 
Two hot-headed hill giants heading for the weapons 
room (area 13) from the great hall (area 11), intending 
to fight an impromptu duel 
The cloud giant from the great hall (area 11) heading 
for the front gate (area 1) 
The stone giant from the great hall (area 11) heading 
for the front gate (area 1) 
Eastern Section. If the characters are in areas 2 
through 10, choose from the following possibilities: 
Grutha, the chief's wife, coming from the great hall 
(area 11) to get her pet cave bear from her room 
(see area 7) 
A hill giant with four dire wolves from the open yard 
(area 22) going to the barracks (area 4) Chief Nosnra (see area 11) and two ogres going to get 
some trophies from the chief's hall (area 6) to show off 
in the great hall 
ld4 + 1 young hill giants (use the ore statistics) from 
the dormitory (area 3) heading through the open yard 
(area 22) to raid the pantry (area 18A) 
Western Section. If the characters are in areas 12 
through 21, choose from the following possibilities: 
• 2d6 ore slaves (commoners) rushing to get shields 
(from area 12 or 13) to use as platters 
Two hill giants from the great hall (area 11) going to 
sleep off a drunk (in area 15 or 16) 
Three ogres from the great hall (area 11) going to get 
one of the guards from the entryway (area 1) 
• A hill giant from the great hall (area 11) taking a stroll 
to clear his head 
Yard and Barracks Rooms. If the characters are in 
areas 22 through 25, they might encounter a hill giant 
from the great hall (area 11) heading for bed. 
LOCATIONS ON THE UPPER LEVEL 
The following locations are identified on map 6.1. 
1. FRONT GATE AND FOYER 
Most of the floor in the entryway is bare, but various 
items of giant outerwear (capes, cloaks, and the like) 
and bags hang from the many pegs along the walls. Use 
the Giant's Bag Contents table to randomly determine 
what's inside any bag or sack the characters happen to 
open. Any noise the characters make could awaken the 
sleeping guards in the area. 
Guards at the Gate. Two snoring hill giants, sup­
posedly guarding the entrance , lie curled up blissfully 
asleep just inside the front gate, a nearly empty keg of 
ale between them. If these guards are attacked and 
not killed in a single round, they alert the third guard 
(posted in the watch tower at area lB). 
lB. TOWER GUARD 
Steps in the western end of the foyer lead up to the 
watch tower, where a hill giant guard is dozing, an 
empty flagon smelling of mead still in his hand. An iron 
hoop and a straight bar hang on ropes from a rafter 
above; striking them together will alert everyone in the 
upper level. 
Treasure. The guard wears a belt with a gem-set gold 
buckle (worth 400 gp). 
2. SUBCHIEF'S ROOM 
This place contains a scattering of furnishings: hides on 
the floors, a bear skin on the wall, a chair, a stool, a huge 
chest, and a vast bed mounted with furs. 
Under the furs on the bed is a sleeping hill giant. It 
requires successful DC 8 Dexterity (Stealth) checks for 
characters to enter this room without waking her, as 
well as when the characters do anything else that might 
make enough noise to rouse her. Any loud noise wakes 
her immediately. 
Treasure. On a shelf 9 feet above the floor are a 
beaten silver comb set with four gems (worth 100 gp), a 
copper mirror (20 gp), and a large gold hairpin set with

a pearl (total value 200 gp). The che r co 
320 sp, and 400 gp. 
3. DORMITORY cp. 
Here twelve young hill giants (use rhe ore s a 5 cs are 
rollicking; beefy smacks, and shout . laugh e~ ca ea ily 
be heard through the corridor outside. All thes _·oung­
sters have weapons and will readily arrack any in ruders 
they spot. Noise coming from here, even shrieks and 
swords clashing, will be regarded by orher a the ·-·ds 
simply having fun. 
4.BARRACKS 
Two soundly sleeping, loudly snoring hill giants occupy 
two of the ten beds in the barracks. Typical giant cloth­
ing hangs from the walls, and a couple of torches smol­
der in wall-mounted cressets. A wooden chest stands 
near the western wall. 
Treasure. A small pouch in the chest contains 40 pp. 
5. MAIDS' CHAMBER 
Three hill giant servants (use the ogre statistics) are in 
this room, along with the usual furnishings. Only the 
nasty old matron, a normal hill giant, is inclined to fight, 
but she dominates the others and orders them to attack 
if necessary. If the matron is slain, the three others 
cease hostilities and cooperate with the characters by 
describing Chief Nosnra's sanctum (areas 8, 9, and 10) 
and telling how to get there safely-if they are allowed to 
have the matron's hoard. 
Treasure. The matron's valuables are stashed in a 
locked iron chest under the matron's bed. The matron 
carries the key to the chest; it can also be unlocked by 
a character who succeeds on a DC 15 Dexterity check 
using thieves' tools. The chest holds 800 gp, three plat­
inum bracelets (worth 1,000 gp each), and four potions: 
healing, superior healing, poison, and mind control (hill 
giant) (see appendix A). The maids can be persuaded to 
part with the potions. 
6. HALL OF THE CHIEF 
umerous interesting things fill this place, which is 
dominated by an enormous fireplace. The mantel of the 
fireplace holds a few items, including a shiny brass jar 
and a humanoid skull. The room has two tables, several 
chairs, and two stools, as well as rugs, hides, and skins 
on the floors and walls. 
The tables have pottery flagons and platters on them; 
pots and kegs are all about the place. The walls display 
various trophies: heads of humanoids and other crea­
tures, skulls, skins, and some arms and armor. Directly 
across from the fireplace, eight shields are mounted 
on the wall. 
Treasure. One of the shields on the wall is a +l shield. 
The brass jar on the mantel of the fireplace might catch 
the characters' eye, but it has no value. The skull on 
the mantel is also valueless, but inside it is a large gem 
worth 500 gp-one of the kids was playing with this 
bauble and stuck it inside the skull, where it has lain for­
gotten ever since. 7. CHAMBER OF THE CHIEF'S WIFE 
Grutha, the chief's wife, is at feast in the great hall (area 
11), while her pet cave bear (use the cave bear variant 
with the polar bear statistics) stays in her room. The 
creature acts as a guard and immediately attacks any in­
truder, for it can smell the person at the door. The bear 
makes no noise until it attacks. 
The room has a bed, a small table, a chair, a stool, two 
chests, and a coffer, plus rugs, hides, and the like. The 
chests contain only clothing, since she is wearing her 
jewelry at the banquet. 
Treasure. Hidden in the bed's straw mattress is a 
leather pouch with twenty-nine gems in it: one worth 
1,000 gp, three 500 gp each, four 250 gp each, eight 50 
gp each, and thirteen of 10 gp value. 
8. CHIEF'S CHAMBER 
The room where the chief sleeps is hung with rugs and 
skins, and there are hides on the floor. It holds a bed, 
two chairs, a small table with a tun of cheap wine on it, a 
chest for clothing, and other clothing hanging on pegs. A 
thick chain (for the chief's cave bear) is set into one wall. 
An old shield and some of the chief's well-used weapons 
lie on the floor near one of the corners. 
9. ARMS ROOM 
The chief's best personal armor, shields, and weapons 
are stored in a chamber that can be accessed only by 
going through the dining room (area 10). There are also 
four huge fur capes among the dozen or so items in 
the place. 
Treasure. Ajavelin of lightning is wrapped in an old 
rag, which is stuffed under a cloak thrown into a far cor­
ner and shielded from sight by three spears and a club 
leaned against the wall in front of it. One of the capes, 
made of a giant otter pelt, is worth 400 gp. 
10. SMALL DINING ROOM 
The room beyond the double doors is used for meals 
and also the council meetings of the chief. It contains a 
long table, a great chair, a lesser chair, and six stools. 
A rough map of the area drawn on a large animal skin, 
showing past and planned raids, hangs on the wall 
opposite the fireplace. Several shelves, a smaller table 
and chair, and some miscellaneous items (a mug, some 
paper scraps, an old knife, a rock paperweight) round 
out the furnishings. There are hides on the walls and 
the floor. 
Hidden Door. Near the southwest corner is a door 
concealed behind a manticore hide hung on the wall. 
Someone looking around the room can notice the shape 
of the door behind the hide with a successful DC 20 
Wisdom (Perception) check. Someone who handles or 
looks behind the manticore skin finds the door without 
needing to make a check. 
lOA. SECRET STAIRS 
Several scroll tubes are concealed in this room under 
a stack of logs in the alcove to the northwest. Someone 
who glances at the logs notices the bone tubes with a 
successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, and any 
search of the pile reveals them. 
CHAPTER 6 AGAINST THE GIANTS 169 

--- PAGE 171 ---

One tube, sealed and marked with a triangle sur­
rounding a Y, holds instructions on the next raid, written 
in Giant and signed Eclavdra. Also inside is a map of the 
floor plan of this level of the steading. All the other tubes 
are empty. 
The steps lead to the secret area of the steading's dun­
geon level (areas 29 through 33). 
11. GREAT HALL 
The long corridor that leads north from area 1 is dim, 
shadowy, and generally deserted and ignored, for all of 
the feasting and fun lies beyond, in the great hall itself. 
A few torches burn smokily high up along either wall. 
The vast room at the end of the corridor contains tres­
tle tables, benches, stools, and the like. Here and there 
stand barrels and kegs of ale, beer, and mead. All of the 
tables are crowded with various sorts of meat, cheese, 
bread, and drinking containers. Singing, talking, laugh­
ing, shouting, arguing, wrestling, joking, and the like are 
going on, so the place is a veritable din of noise. To the 
north of the central firepit (where a whole ox, two sheep, 
and four pigs roast on huge spits) is a higher table re­
served for the chief, his wife, and their guests. 
Creatures. The following creatures are in the hall: 
Chief Nosnra fights as a frost giant with no immu­
nities. He has AC 17 from splint armor. The chief is 
seated at the head table. 
CHAPTER 6 I AGAINST THE Cl ANTS • Nosnra's wife, Grutha, is a hill giant. She sits beside 
the chief. 
The chief's cave bear (use the cave bear variant with 
the polar bear statistics) is licking up spills under the 
head table at Nosnra's feet. 
• The subchief, also seated at the head table, is a hill 
giant that fights as a stone giant, without Stone Cam­
ouflage. His AC is from splint armor. 
, A cloud giant ambassador stands near the firepit. 
A stone giant visitor is seated at the head table. 
Seven hill giants, including the sergeant from area 25 
(who has AC 16 from chain mail and 115 hit points), 
six hill giant servants (use the ogre statistics), and 
eight ogres are scattered around the room. 
There are no throwing rocks here, aside from the few 
that some of the giants, especially the stone giant, might 
carry. On the wall directly behind the chief is a small 
ballista, which he uses as a heavy crossbow (2d10 pierc­
ing damage). It fires spears instead of bolts, and six of 
those projectiles are ready to hand. 
Treasure. Each giant wears one to four pieces of 
jewelry worth 250 gp each. Ogres each wear one or two 
pieces worth 100 gp each. The subchief, decked out for 
the occasion, has four pieces. Nosnra and Grutha also 
wear four pieces of jewelry each, worth 1,000 gp per 
item. The bear has a jewel-studded collar with six ru­
bies. worth a total of 250 gp. 
The largest ogre has a key to the chest in area 21. 

--- PAGE 172 ---

12. ARSENAL ROOM 
Thirty helmets, twenty-six shields. rwen _ -;-o spears. 
nine clubs, and three great axes are rored i a:-se­
nal, scattered around the place. All are gian -size 
13. WEAPONS ROOM 
Spears, shields, clubs, and axes are abundan ere-no 
fewer than a dozen of each, all sized for giant . There 
are four great swords (two-handed with respect ro hu­
man-sized creatures), two huge iron mace rrength 
17 required to lift), and a sheaf of 6-foot-long spears that 
the giants use for javelins. All the shields are leaning 
against the walls. 
Treasure. Behind the seventh shield that the charac­
ters check is a +1 warhammer. Another hammer is out 
of sight in a corner and only seen on close inspection of 
the room. Under the scrutiny of a detect magic spell, it 
radiates an aura of illusion magic due to a magic mouth 
spell placed on it. If picked up by a dwarf it barks out, 
·'Here's a kiss for you, runt!" 
14. MAIN GUEST CHAMBER 
The cloud giant ambassador and the stone giant visitor 
(currently in the great hall, area 11) are lodged here. In 
all, the room holds seven beds and various small fur­
nishings including chairs, nightstands, and chests. One 
torch burns at the west end of the room in a sconce; on 
the opposite wall is a sconce holding a large, unlit torch. 
Various skins and hides cover the floors. Several others 
hang on the walls alongside giant garments on pegs. All 
are worthless, as are the contents of all the chests and 
the bags tucked under four of the beds. Still, a valuable 
reward waits for those who can find it. 
Treasure. The unlit torch is an illusion, and making 
physical contact with it reveals it as such. Someone who 
examines the image without touching it can determine 
that it is an illusion by making a successful DC 15 Intel­
ligence (Investigation) check. The sconce is actually the 
sheath for a weapon that belongs to the cloud giant: a 
sentient greatsword named Waythe (see appendix A). 
15. COMMON ROOM 
The place contains several cots, boxes, and stools, a ta­
ble, two benches, and various odds and ends. 
16. COMMON ROOM 
This place is almost identical to the matching room 
across the hall (area 15), with the addition of a few 
cloaks plus some hides on the floors and walls. 
Treasure. A small chest on a stool in the northeast 
corner contains some dwarf and elf ears, and one of 
them has an earring still attached with a gem in it 
(worth 50 gp). 
17. KITCHEN 
This is a typical giant kitchen with counters along the 
walls, several tables, benches, a stool or two. and vari­
ous items for cooking and baking (pots. kettles. bowls, 
knives, forks, spoons, ladles, spits, and so forth). 
Twenty-nine ore slaves (commoners work about the 
place, but they run away from conflict. Fi\·e hill giant 
servants (use the ogre statistics ) and ix youna ogre ser-vants (use the ore statistics) also run, but they call loudly 
for help as they flee. 
18. KITCHEN WORKROOM 
The storage area north of the kitchen doubles as an 
eating place for servants. It includes three tables, a long 
counter, stools, benches, and an assortment of kitchen 
gear. Numerous sacks, boxes, and barrels contain flour, 
dried meat, dried fruit, honey, and other foodstuffs. Var­
ious cheeses, smoked meats, and sausages hang from 
the rafters. Several casks and tuns hold a wide variety 
of potables-ale, beer, mead, and wine-all of giant 
strength. Loaves of bread, still warm from the ovens, 
are stacked on one table. 
18A. PANTRY 
The room to the south contains more provisions of the 
same types found in the kitchen workroom (area 18), as 
well as stairs that lead to the dungeon level. 
19. SERVANTS'QUARTERS 
A large common room in the extreme north end of the 
stronghold has various cots, tables, chairs, stools, and 
the like. It is cluttered with old clothing and junk. Six 
hill giant servants (use the ogre statistics) are here, and 
a few are flirting with a handsome male hill giant. The 
giant enters combat to show off for his admirers. He will 
not call for help unless his current hit points drop to less 
than half of his hit point maximum. On the round when 
this happens, he begins to shout. Some of the servants 
aid him if he starts to cry out, but others prefer to avoid 
direct conflict, perhaps taking the opportunity to hurt or 
disadvantage a character from the blind side. 
The giant warrior is the keeper of the wolves in area 
22. His whip is hanging beside the door in the southeast 
corner of this room; this whip need only be shown to the 
wolves to make them whimper, cower, and fall back. 
20. 0RC SLAVE QUARTERS 
This hall is a messy and smelly place filled with pallets 
and junk. The two ore slaves (commoners) currently 
in this place are too injured to work (since giants' kicks 
break bones). All the other slaves are elsewhere, helping 
with the feast. 
The two slaves will happily aid the characters if al­
lowed to do so. These ores know about the rebellion 
in the dungeons, and they tell the party that any ores 
they see down there should be hailed as friends. Aside 
from that, they are familiar with only the servants' quar­
ters (area 19), the kitchen (area 17), and the great hall 
(area 11). 
21. OGRE QUARTERS 
The hill giants employ ogres as scouts, messengers, ser­
vants, and the like, for the ogres are trusty flunkies as 
well as hard workers and fighters. In addition to those 
in the great hall (area 11) and the youngsters at work in 
the kitchen (area 17), five more ogres are in their quar­
ters playing at knucklebones and drinking beer. Ogres 
are a rowdy lot; hence, noise from this place attracts no 
attention. Scattered on the floor of the room are nearly 
a dozen heaps of skins on which the ogres sleep, and a 
locked iron chest is tucked into one corner. 
CHAPTER 6 AGAINST THE GIANTS 

--- PAGE 173 ---

Treasure. Hidden inside one of the heaps of skins is a 
leather sack containing a potion of storm giant strength 
and a potion of invisibility. There are ten such heaps, 
and the sack is hidden in the seventh one that the char­
acters search. 
One ogre wears a gem (worth 250 gp) on a thong 
around his neck. The creatures have 381 cp between 
them as the stakes for their game. 
The lock on the chest can be opened by a character 
who succeeds on a DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' 
tools, or by someone who uses the key that is carried 
by one of the ogres in the great hall (area 11). The chest 
holds 955 sp, 202 gp, and 19 pp. 
22. OPEN YARD 
Fourteen dire wolves run free here, and they immedi­
ately attack any humanoid that enters their area. If they 
see the whip from area 19, however, they cower and 
whimper, allowing the intruders to pass unchallenged. 
23. GUARD ROOM 
A huge horn rests upon the small table in the center of 
the room; blowing it calls the dire wolves. Eight stools 
and two benches line the walls, and a sheaf of eighteen 
spears is leaning against the wall by the door. A line of 
seven giant-sized shields and four clubs stands along the 
south wall. The guards that would normally be stationed 
here have gone to the celebration in the great hall. 
24. BARRACKS ROOM 
No one currently occupies the hill giants' barracks 
room. The place contains ten beds, equal numbers of 
chests and stools, two tables, a bench, and miscella­
neous junk. A few hides decorate the floors and walls, 
and several broken weapons and dented helmets are 
strewn about. 
25. BARRACKS ROOM 
This room's contents are similar to those in area 24 
(see above), except for the partially enclosed area to 
the northwest. This alcove belongs to the sergeant 
of the guards, who is now away feasting. There are 
three chests in the space, all filled with clothing and 
equipment for the troops and herself. Giant-sized boots 
are gathered in a sack that hangs from the wall. 
Treasure. One of the boots near the bottom of the 
sack has 300 gp and two gems (worth 100 gp each) 
stuffed inside it. Another sack under the sergeant's cot 
has nothing but old (human-sized) helmets in it, memen­
tos from foes she has slain. 
DUNGEON LEVEL: GENERAL 
FEATURES 
Map 6.2 shows the layout of the steading's lower level. 
The stonework is ancient but holding up well, patched in 
places with new mortar or shored up with newly hewn 
stone. All natural cave areas have stalagmites, but for 
ease of passage the giants have removed stalactites 
from the central caverns (areas 19-21). 
Ceilings. Passageways have ceilings that are arched, 
and buttressed every 10 feet, with the peak of the arch 
about 18 feet overhead. The ceiling height in most small-
CHAPTER 6 I AGAINST THE GIANTS ish rooms in the dungeon is 20 feet or so, again arched 
and buttressed. In the large rooms and chambers, the 
ceilings are 30 feet high. The roof in the natural caverns 
to the southeast (areas 19-21) is of varying height, the 
pa sages about 15 feet high and the large areas some 20 
feer or more. The roof of the carrion crawlers' lair (area 
23 is about 40 feet high. 
Doors. Unless otherwise noted, doors on the dungeon 
le,·el are the same as those on the upper level, made of 
iron-bound logs and each about 7 feet wide and 16 to 18 
feet high. 
Illumination. Torches and braziers provide light in 
several locations, and a few areas are illuminated by 
other means, as indicated in the area descriptions. The 
caverns of unworked stone (areas 19, 20, 21, and 23) 
are unlit. 
Secret Doors. Secret doors on the dungeon level are 
hidden well. It requires a successful DC 20 Wisdom 
(Perception) check to find such a door. 
RANDOM ENCOUNTERS 
On the dungeon level, the chance of a random encounter 
occurs on an hourly basis. At the end of each hour, con­
sult the section below that corresponds to the charac­
ters' current location. 
Excavated Rooms and Passages. If the characters 
are in areas 1 through 18, area 22, or areas 24 through 
33, roll a dl2. On a roll of 1, which indicates a random 
encounter, choose from the following possibilities: 
• Four ogres seeking some ores 
• The Keeper (see area 2), out inspecting, accompanied 
by an ape (one of his pets) 
Twelve rebel ores out raiding for food, two armed with 
heavy crossbows and poisoned bolts 
Caverns. If the characters are in areas 19 through 
21 or area 23, roll a d20. On a roll of 1, which indicates 
a random encounter, choose from the following pos­
sibilities: 
ld4 young giant lizards from area 21 
ld3 carrion crawlers coming from area 22 by way of 
the sinkholes 
LOCATIONS ON THE DUNGEON LEVEL 
The following locations are identified on map 6.2. 
1. MARSHALING AREA 
At the bottom of the stairs that lead from area 18A on 
the upper level is a room where slaves are rounded 
up and sent about their tasks under guard. It is also 
used for the revels of the off-duty dungeon crew. A few 
smoky torches burn along the walls. Several benches 
and tables are pushed out of the way against the walls, 
revealing a floor of black stone, much worn by the tread 
of countless feet. 
2. CHAMBER OF THE KEEPER 
A cluttered room near the marshaling area has skins 
on the floor, a bed, a table and chair, two wooden boxes, 
several crates and barrels, a chest, and odds and ends of 
armor, weapons, furniture, tableware, and so forth. 

--- PAGE 174 ---

above the door. 
The Keeper wears a thick chain mail hir (accounting 
for his AC), and he fights with a giant-ized -I bacrleaxe 
that gives him a +10 bonus to hit. He ha a reach of 1-
feet with the weapon, which deals 20 (3d -7) la hing 
damage on a hit. 
Treasure. Beneath a loose stone in the floor i 
a hole that contains 1,250 gp, three 250 gp gems. 
two 100 gp gems, and a large earthenware jug that 
holds four potions of water breathing . 
3. CELL BLOCK 
In the outer guard room are two bugbears , initially 
located in the eastern end of the area. If not engaged 
immediately, they will raise an alarm by striking a 
large brass gong that hangs near the door. If they are 
prevented from doing so and are faced by an obviously 
superior enemy, the bugbears feign surrender and direct 
the characters' attention to the fourth cell (see below), 
where-so they say-treasure is to be had. Then, when 
the characters are occupied fighting the monsters that 
await within that cell, the bugbears will strike the alarm 
and flee. In addition to the alarm gong, the guard room 
contains a table, two stools, torches, and a ring of keys 
that open four of the five cell doors. 
The cells, from left to right, have the following 
occupants: 
First Cell. A human merchant (noble), taken prisoner 
some time ago and now quite insane from mistreatment , 
is in the cell nearest the door. 
Second Cell. A second human prisoner, an engineer 
(commoner), is kept alive to help with the excavation of 
new areas of the dungeon. He cannot aid his rescuers, 
but he will repay them with service. 
Third Cell. An elf knight is chained to the wall. He is 
wounded from torture (currently down to 14 hit points). 
He gladly takes up arms to aid his rescuers and is will­
ing to serve his rescuers for one year without pay in 
gratitude for his freedom. 
Fourth Cell. The bugbear guards will say that they 
have been instructed to keep three "magical skeletons" 
in one of the cells safe from would-be thieves. To back 
up their tale, they point out-quite truthfully-that they 
have no key to this cell. Indeed, there are three skeletal 
creatures lying on the floor, each one wearing a shiny 
ring set with a large gemstone. 
The lock on the door can be opened by a characte r 
who succeeds on a DC 10 Dexterity check while using 
thieves' tools, or the door can be forced by someone who 
makes a successful DC 15 Strength [Athletics] check. 
The three creatures are wights that spring to attack 
anyone who enters the cell. The rings they wear are 
nothing but brass, and the gems gem tone (gla s). 
Fifth Cell. Five captured ore rebel are crammed into 
the easternmost cell. Three other of their number have already been tortured to death and eaten, so they will be 
very willing to help any creature promising them escape 
from the toils of the giants. These ores can lead the 
characters south and east to the rebels' hideout (area 
19) and will see them safely past the guards behind the 
barricade to the south (at the location marked B) if the 
characters can handle the bugbear at the watch post 
(W) to the west of that place. 
BUGBEAR COMPLEX (AREAS 4-8) 
Each of the five areas of the bugbear community has a 
few torches and braziers burning. Hides and skins deco­
rate walls and floors, while mounds of straw and similar 
litter serve for bedding. Rounding out the furnishings 
are a few stools and small crates, boxes, and the like, a 
scattering of (worthless) personal belongings, and tables 
with scraps of food and odds and ends of eating utensils 
upon them. 
4. Outpost. This room holds eight bugbears , alert 
and ready for trouble. They carry 2d4 gp each. 
5. Barracks. This small barracks holds nine sleep­
ing bugbears. 
6. Barracks. This small barracks is similar to area 5, 
with eight sleeping bugbears . 
7. Chamber of the Bugbear Captain. Currently, five 
bugbears-the captain (a bugbear chief) and four lieu­
tenants (bugbears) -are sitting around a crude table 
drinking ale and discussing a plan to wipe out the rebel 
ores in area 19. All these bugbears have longswords that 
deal 11 (2d8 + 2) slashing damage on a hit. All five are 
carrying 50 gp each. The captain also has thirty-one 10 
gp gems hidden in a pouch under his armor.

8. Outpost. Six bugbears watch this 
alert fellows are readying for an attack o 
One of them is always stationed in the co 
the south exit (at the place marked Won · 
watching the barricade (B) to the ea t for a:: _ -
of activity. 
OBEDIENT SLAVE QUARTERS (AREA 9-ll) 
The three chambers south of the bugbear complex 
are occupied by ore slaves that are considered docile 
by their captors. As such, these rooms are not heavily 
guarded. Each door is barred on the outside with a 
heavy iron rod. 
Each room has a few smoky torches on the walls and 
moldy straw strewn on the floor. Some crude benches 
are built into the walls. 
The occupants of these rooms are subdued to the 
point of being nearly helpless. They will defend them­
selves if harmed, but they offer no resistance otherwise. 
9. Barracks. This room holds twenty-four unarmed 
ore slaves (six ores, eighteen ore commoners). 
10. Barracks. This room holds thirty unarmed ore 
slaves (seven ores, twenty-three ore commoners). 
11. Barracks. This room holds twenty-five unarmed 
ore slaves (five ores, twenty ore commoners). 
Barricade. East of these three rooms (near the place 
marked B on the map), the corridor is blocked by an ac­
cumulation of boulders and debris. 
UNRULY SLAVE QUARTERS (AREAS 12-14) 
Three enclosures to the west of the bugbear complex 
are used to house ore slaves that have proved them­
selves to be troublesome; as such, this area is under 
heavy scrutiny. A bugbear guard, watching for trouble, 
is stationed at each position marked W on the map. 
Each of the barracks is secured by a barred gate 
through which the bugbears can keep an eye on the 
slaves. Each set of bars is secured by a lock and a bolt. 
The lock can be opened by a character who uses thieves' 
tools and succeeds on a DC 15 Dexterity check, or the 
gate can be forced open by someone who makes a suc­
cessful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check. 
The rooms are unlit, have only scanty straw, and are 
quite noisome with the scent of unwashed ore. 
The slaves housed in these rooms are not as meek as 
those in the chambers to the south. If their guards are 
dispatched and they are freed, some of them might be 
willing to take up arms against the giants. 
12. Barracks. This chamber holds forty-eight 
unarmed ore slaves (thirteen ores, thirty-five ore 
commoners). 
13. Barracks. This chamber holds twenty-four un­
armed ore slaves (five ores, nineteen ore commoners) . 
14. Barracks. This chamber holds sixteen unarmed 
ore slaves (ten ores, six ore commoners ). If released, 
they are particularly eager to attack their captors. 
They know of a haven for ore refugees somewhe re 
to the south but not the exact location of the rebel 
headquarters. 
15. TORTURE CHAMBER 
This large area contains various implement for tor­
turing prisoners large and small-an iron maiden. two racks, thumbscrews , iron boots, chains, whips, branding 
irons, strappados, and so forth. A firepit in the center of 
the room lends it all a hellish light. 
Huddled next to the northwest and southwest walls, 
two hill giants are dozing. 
Treasure. One giant wears a gold chain set with a fire 
opal in the manner of a watch fob (worth 500 gp). 
16. ARMORY AND SMITHY 
Stacks of giant arms and armor, either newly made or 
in need of repair, clutter this place. The alcove north of 
the entrance holds several pike-sized spears, battleaxes , 
two-handed swords, and other weapons and armor 
usable only by giants. Some helmets are balanced on 
shields, each propped up by a warhammer or a mace. 
The armorer and the smith, two fire giants, are occu­
pied in the eastern section of the room when the charac­
ters enter. If any of the armor and weapons in the north­
ern section are touched, they collapse with a clatter that 
warns the armorer and the smith of trouble. The giants 
immediately shout and come out fighting. 
Also in the room, near the forge and bellows in the 
southwest corner, are five dwarves chained to the floor 
and forced to labor making weapons. Four of them are 
dwarf commoners intent only on escaping if they are 
released , but the fifth is a veteran who volunteers to 
stay with the characters as long as he receives a share 
of treasure equal to that of a character and a chance to 
fight giants. 
Treasure. The armorer and the smith each have a 
sack filled with 1,000 gp. 
17. BLOCKED PASSAGE 
The rebel ores have piled finished and rough stones 
against the north side of this door to keep it closed. The 
wooden door is bound with moldering bands of bronze, 
and a heavy bronze bolt secures it. Beyond the door, the 
corridor that leads to the southwest is disused, dusty, 
and reeks disgustingly. 
17A. WEIRD ABANDONED TEMPLE 
This room is lined with faintly glowing purplish-green 
stone, engraved with disturbing shapes and signs that 
seem to stare out from the walls and columns and to 
shift positions when the viewer's back is turned. Touch­
ing the walls sends a chill up a character 's spine, and 
touching a pillar brings on nausea-a creature that does 
so must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a 
failed save, the creature becomes poisoned for 1 hour. 
At the far west end of the temple is an altar of pale, 
yellow-gray translucent stone. It feels greasy to the touch 
but has no obvious effect upon those who touch it. Be­
hind this altar is a flight of low, uneven stairs that lead 
to a semicircular alcove with a back wall made of a pur­
plish-black, glassy-appearing substance. Anyone who 
stands before this wall and gazes upon it for 1 round 
sees a writhing , amorphous form of sickly mauve and 
violet stretching its formless members to embrace the 
viewer. This sight forces a character to succeed on a DC 
15 Intelligence saving throw or be cursed with insanity 
(as the symbol spell's insanity effect, but permanent un­
til ended with remove curse, greater restoration , heal, or 
similar magic). 
CHAPTER 6 AGAINST THE GIANTS 
175 

--- PAGE 177 ---

Treasure. The first character who views the wall and 
does not go mad discovers that a ring of mind shielding 
has appeared on the altar. Any other character who un­
dergoes the ordeal and succeeds on the saving throw is 
rewarded with a 1,000 gp gem that appears on the altar. 
18. BURIED VESTRY 
The visible walls of the corridor leading south bear faint 
traces of disgusting murals and bas-relief depictions of 
nasty things. After about 40 feet, the way is completely 
blocked by tons of stone blocks and rubble. 
19. NATURAL CAVERN 
In their excavations, the ancient builders of the strong­
hold stumbled upon an enormous expanse of natural 
caves and caverns. The southern part of this network 
is now inhabited by seventy-eight escaped ore slaves, 
including two orogs, twenty-six ores, and fifty ore com­
moners, for whom the place is a sanctuary. 
The ores, making ready for a rebellion against the 
giants, are armed with clubs, axes, daggers, and var­
ious cast-off weapons, as well as seven highly prized 
crossbows. They obtain food from raids, supplemented 
by fungus they find in a subterranean cave accessed 
through the sinkhole along the southwest edge of 
the cavern. 
The rebel ores have an uneasy truce with the nearby 
troglodytes (see area 20) and trade food to these crea­
tures in exchange for water. If the ores are approached 
in a non-hostile manner, they become agreeable immedi­
ately if the characters mention the possibility of fighting 
against bugbears or giants. 
Guard Posts. The ores have guards at several loca­
tions (marked G on the map) whose main function is to 
act as lookouts in case of incursion from any of the ad­
joining areas. These ores will flee into area 19 to warn 
the others if they spot trouble. 
Treasure. The ores' scavenged loot amounts to 119 
cp, 23 sp, and 45 gp. 
20. TROGLODYTE CAVERN 
A tribe of troglodytes dwells in the central portion of 
the cavern complex. The group includes twenty-three 
adult troglodytes and fourteen young (use the kobold 
statistics). Trapped as they are between the ores in area 
19 and the lizards at area 21, they are trying to make do 
until they can escape. 
Treasure. The tribe's leader has four gems worth 100 
gp each. Nine of the other troglodytes have single gems, 
seven worth 50 gp each and two 10 gp ones. These 
gems are regarded as holy things by the troglodytes, and 
any other creature that touches one of them will be sav­
agely attacked. 
21. LIZARDS' LAIR 
A mated pair of exceptionally old and large subterra­
nean lizards have chosen this spot to raise their young. 
The adults use the statistics for giant crocodiles , except 
that they have a climbing speed of 30 feet, no swimming 
speed, and darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. Their 
four young use the statistics for giant lizards. 
These reptiles occasionally dart forth on forays to 
hunt and devour troglodytes or ores, but their main 
CHAPTER 6 I AGAINST THE GIANTS hunting ground is the series of caves beneath their 
own, the entrance to which is through the sinkhole on 
the eastern edge of their lair. Those unmapped lower 
caverns wander off into the darkness, and are barren 
of treasure or anything of interest aside from many dif­
ferent types of fungus. The lizards feed on the fungus 
when more substantial fare is unavailable. 
22. PARTIALLY CLEARED PASSAGE TO CISTERN 
The well-like chamber at the end of the broad corridor is 
filled with a deep pool of water. This dark liquid is cool 
and wholesome to drink, and only a few albino tadpoles 
dwell in it. It is an emergency water supply fed from 
several spouting springs that come through holes in the 
wall to the west. 
The pool is 14 feet deep, and at the bottom is an outlet 
large enough for a Medium humanoid to pass through, 
The opening is finished stone, obviously constructed. 
This outlet slants upward, providing access to the 
stream that flows through area 23. Anyone who travels 
downstream, along a route that is underwater the whole 
time, comes out about three miles below the stronghold 
in a small pond. 
23. CAVERN OF THE CARRION CRAWLERS 
In the northern end of the cavern complex, two sink­
holes lead down to an even larger area where a number 

--- PAGE 178 ---

of carrion crawlers lurk. They come up o 
time to time to breed or to devour prey th 
tures have dragged here to consume at 
of bones, human and otherwise . are heaped a 
here and there. Seldom does any other~ o o -eature 
venture into the place, for any that do u_ually end up by 
adding their bones to the litter. 
Two carrion crawlers are in the nonhea;; -nger of 
the cavern when the characters first enter. E\·ery 10 
minutes, there is a 30 percent chance thar ld3 more 
of these monsters appear from either the northern or 
southern sinkhole. 
Treasure. Significant treasure has accumulated in 
the creatures' lair over the centuries, but it can be hard 
to find among all the bones and other debris. It takes 
three persons 30 minutes to thoroughly search the 
entire area. If such a search is conducted. refer to the 
Treasure Hoard: Challenge 5-10 table in Chapter 7 of 
the Dungeon Master's Guide. Roll once for each type of 
coin, then roll dlOO to determine whether any gems, art 
objects, or magic items are also found. 
24. STORAGE ROOM 
The chamber at the end of the corridor leading north­
west contains various tools for digging and stone 
masonry-shovels, pickaxes , hammers , drills, chisels, 
baskets, and so forth, many sized for giants but some for 
smaller creatures. 
The door to the north is locked with a huge padlock. 
Unlocking it requires thieves' tools and a successful 
DC 15 Dexterity check. The door can be forced open by 
someone who succeeds on a DC 25 Strength (Athlet­
ics) check. 
25. WINE CELLAR 
A padlocked door identical to the one at area 24 blocks 
entry to the wine cellar. Inside, in addition to several 
large barrels, and various kegs, thirteen casks of ex­
ceptional wine, holding 5 gallons each, are stored here. 
Each of the casks has a bung seal with a blob of black 
wax impressed with a death's head. 
The wine is black, has a slightly earthy smell, tastes 
like no other drink, and is of such excellence that it is 
difficult to stop drinking it. A character who tastes the 
wine must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution or Wisdom 
saving throw (drinker's choice) to keep from becoming 
intoxicated. (One quart is enough to make a giant reel, 
while a pint will make a human drunk.) On a failed save, 
the drinker becomes drunk (poisoned) for 1 hour, and 
must then repeat the saving throw. 
On a successful save after 1 hour, a character stops 
drinking and is no longer drunk. On a failed save after 
1 hour, the character continues to drink until falling un­
conscious for several hours, then awakens and remains 
drunk for 1 hour thereafter. 
Once a character's drunken state ends. whether after 
1 hour or several hours, the drinker suffers one level of 
exhaustion. 
Treasure. This wine is a gift to Chief, To nra. in re­
turn for his good services, from the creatures that are 
masterminding the attacks by the giant . although at 
best the characters can only guess at thi fact. Due to its potency and quality, it has a market value of 500 gp per 
cask if characters can transport it safely out of the dun­
geon and back to civilization. 
26. GALLERY UNDER CLEARANCE 
The north face of this area is being cleared, and a few 
tools are scattered about. The place is otherwise unre­
markable and empty. 
27. CHAMBER UNDER CLEARANCE 
Another unlit and unremarkable place with a few tools 
left lying around. 
28. QUARTERS FOR STONE GIANT MINERS 
The chamber at the end of the corridor holds piles of 
skins, five cots, several stools, two tables, and several 
chests and sacks containing personal gear (including 
several huge, thin books on mining techniques written 
in Giant, with many illustrations). 
Two stone giants, subordinates of the one currently in 
the great hall, make this room their abode. These giants 
are the master miners and engineers for all work in the 
dungeon. They are not interested in fighting for the hill 
giants and politely decline combat with intruders unless 
they are attacked or extorted. 
Treasure. If characters search through the personal 
gear, the third chest opened contains the giants' accu­
mulated pay, amounting to 4,800 gp. 
29. FALSE TREASURE 
If the characters descend the stairs in area lOA and 
follow the obvious route, they come to a large chamber 
in which a faint glint of light shines from the far western 
wall. A collection of coffers can be found in that area, 
one tipped so that some of the gems it held are strewn 
before it. (The gems are worthless rocks, and the un­
opened coffers hold more of the same.) 
To the south, thick iron bars separate this room from 
another chamber that is shrouded in darkness. 
If a character touches one of the coffers or the spilled 
contents, thick iron bars drop from above the entrance. 
This portcullis can be lifted by someone who makes 
a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check. At the 
same time, the bars that block entry into the adjacent 
room (area 30) lift into the ceiling, allowing the crea­
tures therein to emerge and attack. 
30. IMPRISONED GUARDS 
Four manticores are confined here by Nosnra to serve 
as guards for his treasure. Fed kitchen garbage dumped 
down a chute from above, these monsters are wild with 
rage at their captivity and attack any creature if the op­
portunity presents itself. The manticores can fire their 
tail spikes through the gaps in the bars but cannot at­
tack through the bars with bites or claws. 
If the bars across the entrance are down, they can 
be lifted by someone who makes a successful DC 25 
Strength (Athletics) check. A separate check is required 
for each 10-foot section. 
31. MINOR TREASURE ROOM 
The place that the manticores are supposed to guard is 
the storage area for the chief's excess coinage. 
CHAPTER 6 j .\GAIN~ f THE GIANTS 

--- PAGE 179 ---

Treasure. The room contains seven chests and some 
empty boxes. The chests have the following contents: 
The first chest holds bags of coins (amounting to a 
total of 13,000 cp). 
Opening the second chest triggers a scything blade 
trap that targets the opener (+7 to hit), dealing 10 
(3d6) slashing damage on a hit. With a successful DC 
20 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character spots al­
terations to the hinges that are part of the trap mech­
anism. Thieves' tools can be used to disable the trap, 
along with a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. The 
chest holds bags of coins (totaling 9,100 sp). 
The third chest holds loose coins (a total of 2,400 ep) 
and an unlabeled potion (actually a potion of poison). 
Inside the fourth chest are twenty-seven copper ingots 
worth 400 cp each. 
The fifth chest is empty. 
The sixth chest holds eleven ivory tusks worth 
250 gp each. 
The seventh chest is iocked, and the iock is trapped 
with a poison needle (see "Sample Traps" in chapter 
5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). The needle deals 1 
piercing damage and delivers a dose of drow poison 
(see "Sample Poisons" in chapter 8 of the Dungeon 
Master's Guide). Inside the chest are loose gems, 
three hundred twenty-five in all, worth 1 gp each. 
32. SECRET ROOM 
This hideaway is equipped with spy-holes for the chief 
so he can look out upon areas 1 or 29. (There are also 
smaller spy-holes at about 5 feet off the ground that the 
hill giant has never noticed.) 
Two levers are set in the west wall. These control the 
thick portcullises that can block off entry to area 29 or 
release the manticores in area 30. 
33. CHIEF'S SECRET TREASURE ROOM 
Beyond the secret door to this room waits a hidden 
pit, 30 feet deep, with a trapdoor cover that snaps shut 
once someone has fallen through it. A character who 
succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check can 
discern the edge of the trapdoor. In addition, someone 
who prods a pit lid forces the pit open with a success­
ful DC 10 Strength check. The lid can be wedged shut 
with a piton or similar shim. A character doing so must 
succeed on a DC 15 Strength check to place the shim, 
or else the shim fails if someone treads on the pit. A 
creature that falls in takes falling damage plus 11 (2d10) 
piercing damage from the spikes. The spikes are also 
poisoned, so someone injured by them must make a DC 
15 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) poison 
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a 
successful one. 
Treasure. The room holds a number of valuable 
items, including: 
8,000 gp in loose coins inside a large chest 
1,000 pp in a locked iron box (requiring thieves' tools 
and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check to open) 
Eleven 100 gp gems, four 500 gp gems, and two 1,000 
gp gems in a small coffer 
• Seven pieces of jewelry (worth 500 gp each) in an­
other small coffer 

--- PAGE 180 ---

In addition, a large growth of yellow mo 
cover the southwest corner of the room .. 
ical contact with this image reveals its illu5 • 
Someone who examines the image withou ing 
it can determine that it is an illusion by makir:,, a, 
cessful DC 15 intelligence (Investigati on) c ec O a 
successful check, the illusion fades for tha c ~a er. 
becoming transparent enough to see through. 
The illusion conceals the following item . which are 
hung upon the wall: a quiver of eleven -1 arrow . a 
+2 spear, and a flame tongue shortsword. A character 
attuned to this sword can use an action to mentally com­
mand it to detect gems and jewels. Someone who does 
so learns the kind and number of such objects within 60 
feet of the sword. 
Finally, what appears to be a broken barrel rests in 
the southeast corner. This is another illusion, conceal­
ing a well-made, watertight cask that holds a map show­
ing the location of the frost giants' glacial rift and an 
obsidian box. 
Inside this latter container is a long, thin chain made 
of weird black metal and instructions written in Giant 
(using Dwarvish script) on a sheet of human skin. The 
instructions indicate that the chain is a magical device 
meant to be placed on a flat surface and looped into a 
figure-8 shape. (It radiates an aura of conjuration to the 
use of detect magic.) Thus configured, it can transport 
up to one giant or six human-sized persons standing in 
each loop of the figure-8 to the glacial rift, if one of their 
number is holding the map. (Nosnra uses this method of 
escaping if he finds himself in desperate straits.) 
THE GLACIAL RIFT OF THE 
FROST GIANT ]ARL 
Dozens of leagues to the north and west of the Steading 
of the Hill Giant Chief, amid the tallest mountain peaks, 
is the stronghold of Grugnur, Lord of Frost Giants. As 
frost giants have been among those who have been in 
the reaving bands, the party is to deal with them as 
they did the hill giants: death and destruction are to be 
meted out to the frost giants in the same measure they 
gave these things to the peoples below. Those members 
of the party who have participated in the raid on the 
steading should know by now that their most important 
mission is to garner intelligence as to what or who is 
behind the unholy alliance of hill, stone, frost, and pos­
sibly other types of giants as well. Any such information 
gained is to be delivered by the fastest means to the 
nobles sponsoring the expedition, while the party is to 
follow up clues in order to prosecute offenders . Any trea­
sure taken is to be kept by the party; this is their reward 
for the perils they must face-and they are bound to face 
many in the weird ice caves and rocky caverns of the 
jarl. The evil root is deeply grown here, far worse than 
among the hill giants. 
RUNNING THE ADVENTURE 
As with the first part of the adventur e. you hould feel 
free to make substitutions as you see fit. 1 ·ore that if the 
giants here have learned of the fate that befell the hill 
giants, or if survivors from the steading reached them, they will be on the alert. Furthermore, the frost giants 
will organize traps, ambushes, and last-ditch defenses 
against continuing forays into their stronghold, taking 
full advantage of the treacherous terrain (ice slides, rig­
ging tunnels to collapse on the party, and so forth). They 
will also make active efforts to locate the characters' 
base of operations (winter wolves make good trackers) 
and, if successful, attack it at the most inopportune 
time. Finally, make sure to keep track of the fate of im­
portant giants and their allies or captives; those who 
survive might play roles later in the adventure. 
START 
It is assumed that the party has either followed the 
map obtained at the steading or used the magical chain 
found there to arrive in the neighborhood of the glacial 
rift. If they spend a few hours searching the area, they 
discover a hidden cave in which they can safely hide 
themselves, their mounts, equipment, and even trea­
sure if they take minimum precautions with respect to 
keeping their hiding place secret (do not lead pursuers 
to the spot, allow a light to show, make undue noise 
there, etc.). In any event, the same search will also re­
veal the rift. 
The party can travel on the surface of the gla­
cier-mountain (over the caves shown) to circumvent the 
whole rift if they so desire. Ropes can be lowered to gain 
the ledges below-a distance of some 50 to 150 feet de­
pending on position. Every hour the party moves along 
the icy terrain, randomly choose one character to make 
a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If the check fails, 
the character slips and falls. If the check fails by 5 or 
more, the character goes over the edge of the rift. 
The whole place is windy and very cold. Visibility 
atop the rift is about 150 feet. The wind at the bottom of 
the rift is worse still, and visibility there is only 30 feet. 
The floor of the rift is a maze of snow and ice hillocks 
and mounds, with peaks of ice and rock thrusting up 
here and there like fangs. All movement in the rift is 
hampered by this difficult terrain. Due to wind force and 
eddying currents, attempts at levitation or flying cause 
movement in a random direction equal to half the dis­
tance traveled (use a d8 to determine direction: 1 north, 
2 northeast, 3 east, and so on). 
If the party is on the floor of the rift and fleeing from 
pursuing monsters, the blizzard-like conditions in this 
area makes the characters hard to catch. The characters 
have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks to evade 
pursuit. At the same time, winter wolves are considered 
to have passive Perception scores 4 higher than normal 
when they are pursuing the characters. 
The map the characters have shows only the location 
of the rift and the entrance to the place, and they have 
no other idea as to which path they should follow. Other 
than a few traces of giant footprints, the ice and wind­
driven snow hide all traces of who or what uses the 
ledges to gain access to the caves. The characters must 
learn for themselves what lies in store. 
If the adventurers decide to fall back between forays 
into the rift, they can use their hidden cave as a base if 
they have seen to its provisioning.

MAP 6.3: FROST GIANT STRONGMOLD, UPPER LEVEL 
180 CHAPTER 6 AGAINST THE GIANTS 

--- PAGE 182 ---

UPPER LEVEL: GENERAL FE --
Map 6.3 shows the layout of the upper le e of 
rift. The passage from the northea t at e 
map indicates the beaten path that the 2:ian : f; 
enter the glacial rift. The path fork inside -ance. 
each side leading to one of the icv ledges a on~ ei er 
face of the rift. The caves and ca;ern -he:-ein ;re ba-i­
cally formed from ice, with a few area of roe -outcrop­
ping here and there. 
Both ledges slope gradually dowmvard. a indica ed 
by the elevation markers on the map, from a heigh of 
250 feet above the bottom of the rift at their northern 
beginnings to about 150 feet above the rift at the ledges· 
far ends to the south. The central area is the rift itself. 
and the openings along it are the entrances to the caves 
and tunnels in its face. 
Boulders. Several cave mouths on this level are 
blocked by huge boulders (at the places marked B on the 
map). For Medium or smaller creatures , moving these 
obstructions out of the way requires a successful DC 20 
Strength (Athletics) check. 
Ceilings. Caves and caverns have ceilings from 30 to 
45 feet high, while tunnels and passages are from 25 to 
30 feet high. 
Illumination. Throughout this level a faint greenish 
light penetrates from above, making torches or similar 
lights unnecessary. 
Secret Doors. Secret doors in the rift are coated in 
ice and snow, and thus difficult to find. It requires a 
successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check to find 
such a door. 
Slippery Jee. Fireball spells or other fire effects used 
in these icy areas will make the footing within the area 
of effect very slippery. A creature hit by an attack or that 
moves more than half its speed over slippery ice must 
succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or fall 
prone. For 5 minutes after such magical fire is used, the 
area will also be filled with fog that renders the area 
heavily obscured . 
TOKENS OF FREE PASSAGE 
In a few locations within the rift, the characters can 
find and obtain special items that enable them to move 
through the stronghold without raising an alarm. If one 
member of a group displays a token of free passage, its 
privilege extends to the entire group. Those individuals 
are safe from attacks by the giants or the giants' allies 
as long as they take no aggressive action. 
RANDOM ENCOUNTERS 
On the upper level of the frost giant stronghold, the 
chance of a random encounter occurs on an hourly 
basis. At the end of each hour, roll a dl2. On a roll of 1, 
which indicates a random encounter, choose from the 
following possibilities: 
ld4 + 1 yetis 
One frost giant 
ld4 + 1 ogres 
ld6 + 1 winter wolves LOCATIONS ON THE UPPER LEVEL 
The following locations are identified on map 6.3. 
1. GUARDROOM ICE CAVERN 
One frost giant keeps watch here at all times to prevent 
any unauthorized use of the long passage that leads 
south. If combat goes against the giant, he flees through 
this passage to give a warning of intruders to the guards 
at areas 9 and 10. 
The room contains piles of hides, a giant sack, and 
a pile of rocks and ice chunks for hurling. The guard 
certainly hurls missiles if not immediately forced into 
melee. His treasure is at area 6. Note that the giant in 
area 2 will hear sounds of combat here and rush to aid 
his comrade (and vice versa). 
2. GUARDROOM ICE CAVE 
One frost giant waits here on standby guard. On the 
floor of the cave are a pile of sleeping skins and two 
bags. The guard has an ample supply of rocks and ice 
blocks at hand for hurling at opponents. 
If the giant hears noise from area 1, he rushes there to 
help; conversely, if attacked, he will raise a cry to bring 
the guard from area 1 to aid him. 
Treasure. Under the pile of skins is a silver belt worth 
250 gp. The giant wears a jeweled chain on his wrist (a 
500 gp necklace), and one of the sacks holds 950 gp. 
3. EMPTY ICE CAVE 
If loud noise is made in the unoccupied chamber south 
of the guardroom, the ceiling of ice and icicles in this 
area partially collapses. A creature beneath the ceiling 
must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 16 
(3d10) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as 
much damage on a successful one. Softer noises or vi­
sual clues could give warning of the unstable ice. 
4. SMALL ICE CAVE 
This bone-strewn cave is the den of two adult winter 
wolves and their three half-grown pups (use the dire 
wolf statistics). If the young are harmed, the parents 
fight recklessly, risking opportunity attacks and ganging 
up to kill quickly. 
5. ICE CAVERNS 
In a chamber southeast of the wolves' lair, the giants 
have preserved eight corpses of mutilated victims, 
standing them upright and enclosing them in blocks of 
transparent ice. These exhibits are meant to frighten off 
any trespassers. The bodies are obviously hacked and 
very dead, not merely frozen whole. 
Treasure. Each of these corpses has some valuable 
item with it in the ice. Beginning with the northernmost 
one and proceeding clockwis e, the ice blocks contain: 
• A dwarf and a +1 battleaxe 
An elf with a long case at its feet (containing a 
staff of frost) 
A human wearing a jeweled belt (worth 1,000 gp) 
• A human with a tube in its hand that contains a scroll 
of protection (elementals) 
• A dwarf that has a spilled pouch of gems at its feet 
(thirty-seven in all, worth 10 gp each)

, A human wearing a ring of resistance (fire) 
, A half-elf grasping a sack with a burst seam showing 
silvery coins (471 sp) 
, A human wearing gleaming armor that is actually ar­
mor of vulnerability (DM's choice) 
Strong vibrations here, such as from loud noise, can 
cause a cave-in like that described in area 3. 
6. PROVISIONS 
Various pieces of frozen meat, some bales of cloth, piles 
of hides, and a few odd boxes and barrels of foodstuffs 
are stashed in an out-of-the-way cave. 
Treasure. If the characters move any of the boxes and 
barrels around, the third container moved will reveal a 
hole filled with 600 gp, four 250 gp gems, and a silver 
tube (worth 50 gp) that holds a spell scroll bearing a 
3rd-level cure wounds spell. 
7. CAVERN 
This natural rock cavern is covered with ice formations , 
so unless the characters pay particular attention, only 
the lack of light will tip them off that they are no longer 
surrounded by solid ice. On the floor near the southeast­
ern end of the place are four big heaps of furry hides 
(or more, if ogres from the steading survived and relo­
cated here). 
, The hides cover four sleeping ogres, who are awaiting 
an audience with the jar!. Any noise will awaken them, 
and they will give the alarm to their fellows in area 8 as 
well as attempting to give the party the slip and warn 
the giants too. 
Treasure. Each ogre has 200 gp and a gem 
worth 100 gp. 
CHAPTER 6 I AGAINST THE GIANTS 8. OUTH CAVERN 
Oare mercenaries that serve Jar! Grugnur dwell here, 
There are currently six ogres here. All fight fiercely 
when ordered to do so, or when they come upon intrud­
er . Also in the place are five chests, twelve sacks, and 
three barrels, as well as many piles of the usual skins 
and hides used for beds. 
Treasure. Some of the containers in this cavern have 
items of value or possible interest. 
The second chest opened contains an ear collec­
tion, and the fourth holds 1,300 cp, 1,000 sp, 150 ep, 
and 1,000 gp. 
The ninth sack examined contains six pieces of silver 
jewelry (worth 50 gp each) and eight pieces of gold jew­
elry (worth 100 gp each). 
The first barrel opened contains a collection of skulls. 
Hidden under the tenth pile of skins are two potions of 
healing and an armband made of gold fabric with a clasp 
fashioned from ivory and amber sculpted in the form of 
a bear. The armband is vv-orth 500 gp, and it serves as a 
token of free passage. 
CAVERN GUARD POST (AREAS 9 AND 10) 
Giants encountered here are always alert (not sleep­
ing). To determine the position of each guard when the 
characters first enter, roll a d4 twice. Use one of the 
results as the location of the guard in area 9. Add 4 to 
the other roll and use it as the location of the guard in 
area 10. These guards will cooperate and attempt to set 
up ambushes. 
9. Northwest Chamber. One frost giant keeps a 
sharp lookout here. The giant has its greataxe plus a 
boulder ready at hand, with plenty of additional boulders 
piled near the entrances (guard positions 1 and 4). 
10. Southeast Chamber. One frost giant is sta­
tioned here. If alerted, the guard moves into area 9 and 
joins the fray. 
Treasure. The guard wears an armband that is a token 
of free passage like the one described at area 8. Eight 
bags are piled along the south wall (near guard position 
8), each holding 200 gp. 
A rock ledge on the southeast wall, 9 feet off the 
ground, has a stone box atop it. The stone box cannot be 
seen by a human-sized creature standing on the floor. 
Inside this box are two more armbands and a pouch of 
five gems (worth 100 gp each). 
Exit to Lower Level. The passage leading west from 
this area intersects with a down-sloping tunnel that de­
scends 100 feet before opening onto area 1 of the lower 
level (see map 6A). 
11. CAVE OF BONES 
This place is the disposal area for unwanted bodies 
and similar refuse tossed into the place by the various 
giants in the upper area, If the characters decide to 
look through the refuse, it takes 10 minutes to search a 
10-foot-square area, and the toads from area 12 come 
into the place to look for food if they hear any noise. 
Even if the characters are quiet, there is a cumulative 15 
percent chance for every 10 minutes that passes that the 
toads will come looking for food. 

--- PAGE 184 ---

Treasure. Although it certainly appea·;:; 
valuables might be scattered among all 
truth there are only a few coins to be ha -
copper, silver, and gold-and some bro -e, ~-.:~·-.,-.;-~. 
tery shards, and the like. 
12. LOWER BONE CAVE 
This place has many bones and skulls Ii tering i a:1d 
serves as the lair of five giant ice toads see appendi'\'. 
B). These creatures feed on the leaving m area . The 
toads rest on small ledges from 8 to 12 feet above he 
cave floor, and they will hop down and sarngely attack 
anything that touches it. 
Treasure. The creatures have one item of rnlue. a 
naturally shaped piece of reddish-purple amethy t 
(worth 1,000 gp) that resembles a toad. It sits on a pro­
tuberance in the middle of their cave, and they \vorship 
it as a god. 
13. ICE CAVERN 
This place is the home of six yetis that act as scouts for 
the frost giants. The yeti leader at the location marked A 
has a frost brand greatsword. It fights with this weapon 
instead of its claws, dealing 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing dam­
age plus 3 (ld6) cold damage on a hit, and carving great 
chunks out of those held fast by his Chilling Gaze. 
Treasure. The yeti leader has a hoard of eleven ivory 
tusks, each weighing 2 pounds and worth 200 gp, bur­
ied under a mound of snow. 
14. MISTY ICE CAVE 
Escaping hot air from somewhere beneath filters into 
this place through numerous cracks in the floor, mak­
ing it full of damp, cold fog. The cracks are about 1 foot 
wide, not enough to hamper movement. The fog renders 
the area heavily obscured, and the floor is very slippery. 
A creature hit by an attack when on the slippery ice 
or that moves more than half its speed over the ice 
must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall 
prone. If a character's save fails by 5 or more, the char­
acter drops an object in hand, which falls into one of the 
cracks. The object tumbles somewhere into the bowels 
of the earth, forever lost. 
15. ICE CAVE 
This is the den of two large snow leopards (use the tiger 
statistics), which serve as pets of the yetis in area 13. 
These creatures lair on a ledge above the floor of the 
cave, and they try to take intruders by surprise. 
BARRACKS COMPLEX (AREAS 16-19) 
This section of the stronghold houses a group of frost gi­
ants readying for a raid. Each of the separate areas has 
piles of hides for sleeping, a table and stools, and a few 
extra giant-sized weapons around. Each giant here has 
2d4 rocks to hurl. 
16. Outer Sleeping Area. One frost giant resides in 
the northeast cavern. 
17. Upper Sleeping Area. The northwest cave holds 
one frost giant. 
18. Middle Sleeping Area. Two frost giants occupy 
the largest of these caverns. At the back of this cave is a 
clear spring of water about 2 feet deep. at the bottom of which are two hundred seventy-eight clear rock crystals 
worth 10 gp each. 
19. Lower Sleeping Area. One frost giant is in the 
southernmost chamber. 
20. ICE STORAGE CAVE 
This place is full of large and small pieces of frozen 
meat. Some of the chunks resemble parts of human and 
other humanoid bodies. 
21. ICE CAVERN 
A warning carved into the icy floor in Giant with 
Dwarvish runes clearly shows that this place is to be 
shunned. Ten feet beyond where the passage turns 
to the southwest, the walls appear to be crusted with 
rough old ivory-in fact, this is an infestation of brown 
mold (see "Dungeon Hazards" in chapter 5 of the Dun­
geon Master's Guide). The floor is dotted with mounds of 
what look like old snow with the ends of bones sticking 
out of them. These are the bony remains of various crea­
tures, covered by the growth. 
22. GUARD ICE CAVE 
Two frost giants are stationed here; one watches at 
the cave mouth, while the other naps on a pile of hides. 
Eight throwing rocks are within reach in the cave. 
Treasure. Each giant has a sack. No other valuables 
are present. 
23. GUARD CAVE 
Two frost giants rest here. One giant watches down 
each passage while the other sleeps on a heap of skins. 
Each has a weapon and four rocks to hurl. 
Treasure. There are four sacks in the cave, but noth­
ing else of value. 
Exit to Lower Level. The passage leading east from 
this area eventually intersects with a down-sloping tun­
nel that descends 100 feet before opening onto area 1 of 
the lower level (see map 6.4). 
24. VISITORS' CAVE 
Two hill giants and their three hill giant servants (use 
the ogre statistics) are camped here awaiting a sum­
mons from the jar!. The cave has five heaps of hides and 
five giant-sized bags. 
Treasure. The fourth bag searched contains a gold-in­
layed skull with a report from Chief Nosnra to Jar! Grug­
nur on a piece of parchment rolled up inside it. This 
document serves as a token of free passage to the hall 
of the fire giants. The biggest hill giant knows that they 
are bound south to King Snurre's realm after seeing the 
jar!, intending to take a message to the fire giant king. 
In addition, each hill giant wears a fur cloak 
worth 1,000 gp. 
25. VISITORS' CAVE 
Two stone giants have come to the rift to pay their re­
spects to the jar! and to see how well the frost giants are 
doing in their war on humankind. They will report their 
observations to other stone giants if they get the op­
portunity. They fight only if attacked. Each has a stone 
greatclub and three rocks handy. 
CHAPTER 6 I AGAINST THE GIANTS

--- PAGE 186 ---

Treasure. Hidden among the pile of s 
is a jeweled platinum crown (worth 3.000 ~ 
stone giants intend to give to the jar! a 
pears to be doing well. 
26. SPECIAL VISITORS' CAVE 
This location is warmed somewhat by rnlca~ic acchi 
and lit by dim reddish light. In it are a fire gianc mes­
senger and his fire giant servant (as a hill giant wi h 
fire immunity) who have delivered their me age and 
are about to depart for their own land. There are r,1,0 
piles of furs and skins in the place, a rude table. a bench. 
three stools, a large brazier, and two sacks. 
Treasure. One giant's sack contains 1,500 gp and the 
other 500 gp, in addition to the usual contents. In a pad­
ded bag at his belt, the messenger carries a symbol of 
the jarl's fealty to King Snurre: a solid silver statue of a 
bear, rampant, with topaz eyes (worth 1,500 gp). 
27. WINTER WOLF PACK 
Along the western side of the rift floor is the lair of a 
pack of five winter wolves. The wolves are encouraged 
to roam the place by the frost giants. 
28. SNOW-COVERED DOME OF ICE 
This hollowed-out ice formation has been created by the 
creature that lairs inside-a remorhaz that has recently 
moved into the rift. A number of charred skeletons are 
strewn around its icy den. 
29. WHITE PUDDINGS 
The two spots marked with numbers along the east 
edge of the rift floor are the locations of a pair of Huge 
white puddings. A white pudding uses the statistics 
for a black pudding, and its coloration gives it perfect 
camouflage in these icy conditions. While a white pud­
ding remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a 
mound of snow. 
LOWER LEVEL: GENERAL FEATURES 
Map 6.4 shows the layout of the lower level of the glacial 
rift. This area has basically natural formations, with 
some rough-hewn connecting passages and enlarge­
ments made here and there. 
Boulders. Some passageways on this level are 
blocked by huge boulders (at the places adjacent to 
boulders that are marked B on the map). For Medium 
or smaller creatures, moving these obstructions out of 
the way requires a successful DC 20 Strength (Athlet­
ics) check. 
Ceilings. Passages have ceilings that are about 25 
feet high. Ceilings of small caverns are 30 to 40 feet 
high, and those of the large caves 45 to 60 feet. 
Illumination. Light in this area comes from torches 
and from cressets that are actually cages for giant 
fire beetles (the latter mostly in the part inhabited by 
the jar!). 
RANDOM ENCOUNTERS 
On the lower level of the frost giant stronghold, the 
chance of a random encounter occurs on an hourly 
basis. At the end of each hour, roll a dlO. On a roll of 1, which indicates a random encounter, choose from the 
following possibilities: 
• One frost giant, a guard making the rounds 
ld4 + 1 ogres on an errand for the jar! 
One frost giant and two ogre servants out for a walk 
If the giants know intruders are about, one frost giant 
and three winter wolves search for those intruders. 
LOCATIONS ON THE LOWER LEVEL 
The following locations are identified on map 6.4. 
1. GRAND ENTRY CAVERN 
The entrance to the lower level is obviously meant to 
be impressive, as its walls bear carvings of battle and 
hunting scenes in bas-relief. These carved scenes show 
giants slaying enemies, hunting dragons and other 
fearsome monsters, and engaged in similar activities. 
Torches burn at intervals along the length of the cavern. 
Survivors of attacks on the level above will most likely 
make a stand in the grand entry cavern if they are still in 
relatively good shape. 
Secret Exits. The boulders that close off the passages 
to the east and west are well concealed and look much 
like the normal cavern walls, so each must be discov­
ered by characters as though it were a secret door. 
2. VAULTED CAVERN 
The noise of moving the boulder that closes the place 
off from the rest of the complex awakens a mated pair 
of young white dragons that are kept here, along with a 
great pile of treasure. If they have enough warning, both 
the dragons hide and wait to see who enters. 
The only intruders that the dragons do not object to 
are frost giants coming to feed them or bearing treasure 
to add to the dragons' hoard. Unless the male dragon is 
hiding, he sits proudly atop a heap of valuable items in 
CHAPTER 6 AGAINST THE GIANTS 

--- PAGE 187 ---

r86 the north end of the cavern. The female rests nearby on 
a ledge that projects from the western wall of the cham­
ber (see area 2A). 
Treasure. The dragons' hoard includes the fol­
lowing items: 
• 15,000 sp and 12,400 gp in loose coinage 
• Eight silver boxes filled with ivory (weighing 20 
pounds apiece, each box worth 300 gp plus 100 gp for 
the ivory inside it) 
• An alabaster statue depicting a winged woman (a 
deva), worth 800 gp 
Seven white marble statues of no great worth 
• A scattering of three hundred fifty gems, 
worth 1 gp each 
• Eleven pewter serving pieces of small worth 
• Twenty-four various weapons (a +2 dagger 
among them) 
Nine shields 
Eight suits of armor (including a silvered set of +2 
chain mail) 
• Twenty-seven urns of small value 
• Sixty-one bottles and flasks, valueless except for one 
that holds a potion of poison, another that is a potion 
of resistance (fire), and two more that hold potions of 
diminution and growth respectively 
2A. DRAGON'S LEDGE 
A ledge about 30 feet above the floor of the cavern has a 
cave-like nook at the back. On the elevated area, the fe­
male dragon hides and watches. If roused to action, she 
joins the battle as stealthily as she can. 
Treasure. The female has hidden twelve gems worth 
250 gp each (eight opals and four diamonds) behind her 
on the ledge. 
3. ABANDONED STORAGE CAVE 
The place contains some remnants of carcasses, a few 
broken boxes with spoiled provisions, some split sacks 
containing moldering grain, casks of wine turned to vin­
egar, and ale barrels that have been stove in. 
If any of the denizens from above fled to this level and 
are injured or were being hotly pursued, they attempt to 
avoid notice by hiding in this storeroom. 
4. DESERTED CAVERN 
Broken items of giant-sized furniture litter this place­
the remnants of tables, benches, stools, and chairs. 
Soot-covered wall cressets hold burned-out torches. 
Three skeletons of frost giants are plainly visible near 
the center of the cavern. 
Treasure. Loose coins amounting to 500 gp, spilled 
from a rotted sack, are scattered around the frost giant 
skeletons. Note that the monsters at area 4B will attack 
any creatures that poke around in these bones. 
4A. STONE RUBBLE 
A frost giant skeleton rests in the far south end of the 
chamber, half-buried under stone rubble. It appears that 
the giant was trying to flee from the cave-in of a passage 
to the south (behind the rubble) but failed to make it and 
was killed by falling rocks. 
CHAPTER 6 I AGAINST THE GIANTS Treasure. One of the giant's skeletal hands clutches 
an iron tube containing a map that shows areas 1, 2, 3, 
and 4 of the lower level. Area 1 is labeled (in Common) 
as -Grand Entry," area 2 as "Storage Place," area 3 
a -Provisions," and area 4 as "Great Hall of the Jar!." 
The map also shows a passage leading south from this 
chamber (along the way now blocked by rubble), which 
after some 60 feet reaches a complex of caves and cav­
erns, including various barracks room, the jarl's private 
chambers, and a treasure room. 
This map is actually a fake, a ruse perpetrated by the 
jar! to mislead would-be robbers. If the characters at­
tempt to dig out the rubble to find the supposed treasure 
room, they succeed only in making a lot of noise-no 
passage beyond can be unearthed. 
4B. HUNGRY AND HOPPING 
Six giant ice toads (see appendix B) lair in the northern 
extreme of this chamber. They are very hungry and seek 
to ki!! and deVOUf any Creat11rP<: th:,t PntPr thP f'!HTPrn, 
forcing themselves to wait only long enough for intrud­
ers to be distracted by the glint of gold and lure of bone 
in the center of the main cavern. 
5. ENTRANCE CAVERN 
Hidden by a camouflaged boulder from prying eyes, this 
chamber is the actual entrance to the jarl's complex. 
It is always guarded by a frost giant equipped with a 
weapons and throwing stones, plus a giant's bag. If 
a conflict erupts, the giant tries to sound a great iron 
horn suspended from the ceiling on iron chains in the 
center of the cavern. The giant has to use an action to 
blow the horn. 
6. EMISSARIES ' CAVERN 
An oni and its four ogre servants are staying here. They 
have had an audience with the jar!, and after a special 
wassail to be held on the morrow they will depart for 
home with a treaty scroll. This scroll is signed (with a 
special mark) by the jar! and offers the Lord of the Oni 
25,000 gp worth of gems, plus whatever loot the lord's 
minions garner, if they will join the war on humankind . 
Treasure. The oni wears a necklace of fireballs with 
five beads remaining that it will not hesitate to use. The 
oni also bears a pouch containing six 500 gp gems (gifts 
from the jar!). 
A small iron casket among the oni's belongings holds 
a gift to the Lord of Oni-a trick box made out of eigh­
teen plates of platinum, eighteen plates of electrum, and 
eighteen plates of silver. The box is opened by sliding 
certain plates on the left side, then the top, then the 
right side in a particular sequence. The correct order is 
platinum-electrum-silver on each end, and silver-elec­
trum-platinum on the top. 
The box has properties similar to those of a bag of 
holding-although the container is but 10 inches long 
by 6 inches wide and 4 inches deep, it holds 3 cubic feet 
of material or 60 pounds, whichever is the lesser. At 
present the box contains 500 gp, a potion of mind con­
trol (frost giant) (see appendix A), and a potion of cloud 
giant strength. 

--- PAGE 188 ---

7. GUEST CAVERN 
A torch-lit place adorned with tape tries. 
able chamber has skins and hides coveri ~ 
and a bed heaped with soft pelts. Furnis 1-_s 
a chest, a bag, a table, two chairs. and a m.tll 
net. The cloud giant who is the currem Que: 
agreed to join the jar! as his chief hench~a . 
Treasure. The chest holds 2,200 gp. and e 
giant wears a silver belt set with ivorv and r:ems 
(worth 600 gp). --
8. PRISON CAVERN 
Torches light the place dimly. A female storm giant i 
chained on the north wall with huge manacle at her 
wrists and ankles. A fur rug in the middle of the place 
bears a table and two chairs. Upon the table are heaps 
of food on six golden platters and in three silver bowls. 
Two huge flagons of ivory set with gems have been filled 
with fine wine; the scents from the food and the wine fill 
the chamber. 
These refreshments have been set out to tantalize the 
giant into submitting to the jarl's will and becoming his 
leman, but she has not been won over-quite the oppo­
site is true. Being subjected to this durance vile makes 
her a friend to any who rescue her, although she de­
spises evil. Thus, the presence of evil characters in the 
party will cause her to fulfill her obligation as quickly 
as possible and depart. By contrast, she might strike 
up a long-term friendship with a party of good-aligned 
characters. 
Treasure. The platters are worth 500 gp each, the 
bowls 50 gp apiece, and the flagons have a value of 
100 gp each. 
9. SERVANTS' QUARTERS CAVERN 
Eight ogres dwell here. Each has its own pile of hides 
and rags for sleeping, a wooden box for goods, a peg to 
hang outer garments , and a bag. The ogres serve the jar! 
willingly and fight fiercely. 
Treasure. Each ogre has ldlOO sp, ldlOO ep, and 
ldlOO gp in its box or its bag. 
10. ANTECAVERN 
A frost giant guard is alert inside this oblong cavern 
at all times. He has a greataxe and one throwing rock. 
He shouts to alert the guards to the south if intruders 
enter the area. 
11. GREAT CAVERN OF THEjARL 
This is where all the special functions and feasts hosted 
by the jar! take place. Various tables and benches line 
the east and west walls, pushed out of the way for now 
until they are needed. Caged fire beetles dimly illumi­
nate the place, which appears to be deserted. 
Guard Posts. The ledges marked A and B are more 
than 30 feet above the floor and hidden in dark shadow. 
Each of the ledges holds a watchful frost giant with a 
supply of six rocks to throw. 
12. AUDIENCE ALCOVE AND THRONE DAIS 
A stone outcrop partially encloses an area in the south 
of the jarl's cavern. A enormou s ivory and bone throne, 
decorated with skulls, silver, and gems, rests near the south wall of this alcove. Hung behind it, spread out 
against the rough wall, is a white dragon hide. Before 
the throne on the floor is the skin of a huge polar bear. 
Three ivory stools are off to one side of the throne; these 
are the seats of the jarl's lieutenants . 
Treasure. The gems that decorate the throne consist 
of sixty worth 50 gp each, fifteen worth 100 gp each, 
three of 500 gp value, and one 1,000 gp gem. 
13. GUARD AREA 
One frost giant guard stationed in the far southern 
end of this chamber looks east and west at varying 
times. He has two rocks. If an intruder is seen, he will 
sound a large gong on the north wall (possibly with a 
thrown rock). 
14. KITCHEN 
Two fire giant servants (use the hill giant statistics , plus 
immunity to fire damage) and four ogres labor in the 
kitchen, roasting a horse over the natural firepit and oth­
erwise readying the jarl's food. Various foodstuffs, fur­
niture, and utensils are scattered about in all the nooks 
that lead away from the firepit. Amid heaps of foodstuffs 
to the north are four human captives (commoners) in a 
cage, being saved for a feast. They can warn the charac­
ters about what lies in areas 15, 16, and 17. 
15. WEAPONS CAVE 
Herein are stored sixty-two throwing rocks, eight 
shields, fifteen spears, five clubs, and five helmets, all 
of frost giant size. The cave also holds six battleaxes 
(which the giants can hurl) and a well-made chain shirt 
of giant size. 
16. COMMON QUARTERS CAVERNS 
Currently one frost giant, two frost giant servants (use 
the hill giant statistics, plus immunity to cold damage), 
and three young frost giants (use the ogre statistics, 
plus immunity to cold damage) call this place home. If 
the frost giant is killed, the others weepily surrender , 
not fighting thereafter unless they are attacked. 
In addition to the giants, the room holds piles of skins 
and hides, a few stools, eleven large boxes, five chests, 
and many pegs (currently with fourteen capes and nine 
bags hanging from them). 
Treasure. Under the ninth box moved by the charac­
ters is a hole in the floor that contains 3,500 gp. 
17. KENNEL CAVE 
The jarl's hunting pack-four huge polar bears with 65 
hit points each-lairs here. 
Treasure. Each bear wears a gem-studded collar 
worth 200 gp. 
CAVERNS OF THE CARLS (AREAS 18 AND 19) 
Two large caverns provide quarters for the frost giant 
gentry. Each inhabitant has a cot, a chest, a chair or 
a stool, and several hides and skins for bedding. The 
whole area is lit by torches and a few fire beetles, with 
many pegs holding cloaks, capes, and bags along the 
walls. Three huge lockers, three hampers, and six ward­
robes make up the rest of the furnishings. The giants, 
some of them warriors and some of them servants, are 
CHAPTER 6 I AGAINST THE GIANTS 

--- PAGE 189 ---

r88 willing to negotiate to protect the young, which they fight 
to the death to protect or avenge. 
Treasure. Each giant warrior in the place has 1,000 
gp plus an armband that is a token of free passage (iden­
tical to the one described at area 8 of the upper level). 
Each other adult giant has 500 gp. The young have 
no treasure. 
18. West Chamber. This large cave is occupied by two 
frost giants and three frost giant servants (use the hill 
giant statistics, plus immunity to cold damage) along 
with three young frost giants (use the ogre statistics, 
plus immunity to cold damage). 
19. East Chamber. This slightly smaller area holds 
one frost giant, one frost giant servant, and two young 
frost giants. 
20. jARL'S ANTECAVERN AND TROPHY HALL 
Jar! Grugnur receives visitors in a chamber on the 
southern edge of the lower level. The eastern half of the 
cavern is a private audience hall, with pelts and skins on 
the walls and floor, a table, and four chairs. Some worth­
less scrolls are on the table, and on the walls of this area 
hang two normal shields, a heavy crossbow, two normal 
two-handed swords, and a pair of huge ivory tusks of no 
value. A few worthless furs and tapestries hang on the 
short sections of wall to the north. Both halves of the 
hall are illuminated by caged fire beetles. To the east a 
CHAPTER 6 I AGAINST THE GIANTS set of well-worn steps, each about 3 feet high, lead up to 
an exit screened by thick, leathery hides. 
The western spur of the chamber is the jarl's trophy 
hall. Here, the jar! often sits in a comfortable chair and 
ruminates over past glories and future plans; the floor 
in this area has actual rugs. The walls of the alcove are 
adorned with a host of trophies, including a cave bear 
pelt of enormous size, a wyvern skin, the rack from a 
giant stag, the mandibles and claws of an umber hulk, 
giant scorpion claws, the horn of a woolly rhinoceros, 
a pair of mammoth tusks, a pair of mastodon tusks, 
a giant boar head, a griffon skin, the wings of a giant 
eagle, a giant lynx pelt, and the jaws from a subterra­
nean lizard, 
Treasure. In addition to all the trophies of kills men­
tioned above, the place holds several items that are valu­
able or potentially useful. Many of them are weapons or 
armor of normal (nonmagical) sort, including: 
• A bow and a quiver with sixteen arrows 
Three shields 
A light crossbow and fourteen bolts 
A greataxe, two spears, and a flail 
A huge iron mace 
• A suit of splint armor sized for a dwarf 
A suit of plate armor sized for a human 
Other items of interest, because of their magical nature 
or unusual appearance, are as follows: 

--- PAGE 190 ---

A +l shield that is trapped (see below) 
The skull of a dwarf wearing an iron o rnue) 
Eleven +l bolts 
Two walrus tusks that are trapped ( ee belo one of 
which is an ivory-covered bronze horn of\al alla 
A white dragon skull that has an aura of ab_ura ion 
magic about it 
, A suit of +1 plate armor sized for an elf 
Three elaborate tapestries (one worth -1-00 gp. anoher 
valued at 100 gp, and one that is worthle s) 
Trapped Shield. If the magic shield is taken down 
from the wall, that act releases a spear trap that fires 
straight ahead to a range of 60 feet. The spear has a -10 
bonus to hit and deals 10 (3d6) piercing damage on a 
hit. The trap mechanism can be seen by someone who 
examines the shield and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom 
(Perception) check. Given 1 minute or so, a charac-
ter who uses thieves' tools and succeeds on a DC 15 
Dexterity check can jam the mechanism so the spear 
can't launch. If the check fails by 5 or more, the spear 
launches even if the shield is still on the wall. 
Trapped Tusks. If either of the walrus tusks is 
touched, the dragon skull screams "Alarm! Robbers!" 
in Giant until the skull is smashed to pieces, which con­
tinue to quietly whimper for some time thereafter. 
21. JARL GRUGNUR'S PRIVATE CAVERN 
The chief of the frost giants and his lady reside in a 
secluded chamber on the southeast edge of the strong­
hold's lower level. 
Living Area. The western part of this chamber con­
tains a huge table, four chairs, three wardrobes, five 
chests, five trunks, and seven coffers. The walls are 
hung with heavy tapestries and various pelts and skins, 
all of no particular worth. 
Jar! Grugnur (use the cloud giant statistics, plus 
immunity to cold damage but without Keen Smell and 
Innate Spellcasting) sits at the table in his chain mail 
jack with his arrow-catching shield nearby (AC 18, or 
AC 20 against ranged attacks, with his shield; AC 16 
without it). At his hip is his +2 longsword. The jar! has 
a +14 bonus to hit with the weapon and deals 23 (3d8 + 
10) slashing damage on a hit. In his hand is a platinum 
drinking horn set with eight gems. 
Across the table is Estia, his lady (use the cloud giant 
statistics, altered as for Grugnur), a fierce beauty with a 
cloak of saber-tooth tiger hide about her and an iron +2 
morningstar at her hip. On the table in front of her is a 
gold flagon set with eight gems (1,200 gp). 
Two winter wolves are crouched under the table. 
Treasure. The jarl's drinking horn has a value of 
2,000 gp, and his lady's flagon is worth 1,200 gp. 
All the various containers in the room contain cloth-
ing and other unremarkable items, except as follows: 
The second chest searched holds 700 pp. 
The fifth chest has 3,200 gp. 
The fourth trunk has a thick layer of old socks, under­
neath which are eight potions (speed, superior healing, 
storm giant strength, poison, oil of slipperiness, heal­
ing, and a philter of love). The second coffer has nine pieces of jewelry (worth 
1,000 gp each). 
The sixth coffer holds one hundred ninety-eight gems 
(one hundred four worth 10 gp each, fifty-one of 50 gp, 
thirty-six of 100 gp, six of 250 gp, and one of 1,000 
gp value). 
Sleeping Area. The eastern portion of the cavern is 
partially screened off by hangings. This cozy nook holds 
a rumpled bed, a small table, a chair, two stools, a chest, 
a trunk, and various odds and ends of clothing, armor, 
and weapons here and there. The walls are hung with 
pelts and rugs of no particular value. 
Treasure. The lid of the trunk has a secret drawer in 
it that contains six scroll tubes. The jar! will take these 
items if he is forced to flee and has time to get them. The 
contents of the tubes are as follows: 
Number 1 is empty. 
Number 2 holds a key to the invisible chest in the hid­
den escape tunnel (see below). 
Number 3 contains a map marking the location of the 
Hall of the Fire Giant King. 
Number 4 holds a scroll of protection (fiends). 
Number 5 contains a scroll of gibberish with an explo­
sive runes glyph of warding on it (spell save DC 15). 
Number 6 has two spell scrolls, one of delayed blast 
fireball and one of finger of death. 
HIDDEN ESCAPE TUNNEL 
Behind the wall hangings in the northeast end of the 
chamber is a natural passage about a mile long that 
turns south and exits at the base of the glacier, out 
of sight of anyone near the rift. Someone who looks 
around the room can notice the opening in the wall 
through gaps in the hangings with a successful DC 15 
Wisdom (Perception) check. Someone who handles the 
hangings in this area or looks behind them finds the 
opening without needing a check. 
The alcove to the northwest just inside the tunnel has 
a thick iron bar protruding from the wall about 10 feet 
off the ground. To a casting of detect magic, the bar has 
a strong aura of conjuration. Noticing the bar without 
specifically looking up for it requires a successful DC 
15 Wisdom (Perception check). If the bar is pushed 
downward, that act transports whatever or whoever is 
standing on the floor of the alcove to a spot some 50 feet 
distant from the entrance to Snurre's hall (the Hall of 
the Fire Giant King). 
An apparently empty ledge high in the southwest wall 
is the resting place of an iron box that is invisible, has no 
magical aura, and is locked (requiring a successful DC 
20 Dexterity check to open). Those who investigate the 
ledge can find the box only if they blunder into it or they 
are able to see invisible objects. The chest becomes visi­
ble when opened. It has a glyph of warding (save DC 17) 
inside the lid. The glyph triggers if the chest is opened 
without its key. If triggered , the glyph casts cloudkill 
(spell save DC 17) centered on itself. The box's contents 
are meant to be taken to the fire giants' stronghold and 
given as gifts to the powers behind the uprising. 
Treasure. In the iron box are a pearl of power, a set of 
Nolzur's marvelous pigments, and a wand of paralysis.

HALL OF THE FIRE GIA ~T 
KING 
Just as the trail led from the Steading of the .ill Gian 
Chief to the frozen wastes wherein wa fou e Gla­
cial Rift of the Frost Giant J arl, so the adven·ure i. e 
latter place has led (or transported ) the inrrepid parry 
to what they hope will be their last challenge. They 
are about to venture into the hot and smokin barren 
which are in effect Muspelheim, the home of the fire 
giants. In the vast rocky halls of the fire giant · dou hey 
liege lord, the dread King Snurre Iron Belly. they hope 
to find not only great treasure but the answer to the 
question of what or who is behind the strange alliance of 
many different types of giants. Surely here in the strong­
hold of the fire giants will be encountered the evil genius 
or geniuses controlling the uprising and planning the 
well-executed attacks, for Snurre is said to be far stron­
ger than smart. 
It is a sad fact that the characters can expect all 
encounters here to be worse than those the party has 
faced elsewhere, for fire giants are ferocious opponents, 
and their associates and helpers will undoubtedly be 
proportionately stronger and more fearsome than those 
of the lesser hill and frost giants-a sobering thought 
indeed! Surely the rewards for success cannot fail to 
be greater, for the fire giants-and their masters, per­
haps?-have more loot for the taking. 
If the party (or one or more members thereof) has 
been to the other two places, the characters will know 
that there is a charge upon them to report definite infor­
mation to the rulers who have sent them forth to inflict 
punishment on the rapacious giant raiders. Their mis­
sion: to slay fire giants and all who associate with them. 
Failure means death, not from the nobles, but from the 
monsters the party must face. Success means the right 
to keep all the loot they find, plus the possibility of re­
ward from the rulers of the lands being ravaged by the 
giant bands. 
And now the adventurers stand before the black 
and smoking slag hill that holds the Hall of the Fire 
Giant King. They have penetrated near the heart of 
the matter-into a fell realm where even the strongest 
need beware! 
RUNNING THE ADVENTURE 
As with the previous adventures in this series, it is up to 
you to add to the considerable detail given herein, filling 
in any needed information to color the whole and bring 
it to life. You, as Dungeon Master, must continue to im­
provise and create, for your players will certainly desire 
more specifics, seek to do things not provided for herein, 
and generally defy expectation. The script is here, but 
you will direct the whole, rewrite parts, and sit in final 
judgment on characters' actions. 
If you have already taken your players through the 
first two adventures , be particularl y mindful of how 
their behavior there will have altered what is described 
here. Use the parameters given to design your own epic. 
Be disinterested, and be just. This is a very difficult 
scenario, and the players might rue thoughtless actions, but do not allow this reaction to temper what you have 
before you. Likewise, do not set about to entrap the 
characters in a hopeless situation-allow their actions to 
dictate their fate. 
Remember also that these giants are not only the 
toughest so far encountered but also have the best ad­
vice immediately available to them. As soon as the party 
strikes and then retires, the attack will be assessed 
and countermeasures taken. Even when the party first 
enters the hall, you will have to gauge the reaction of 
the giants if and when they learn that intruders are 
within. How will they react? From whence will they call 
in guards? Where will Snurre go? Most assuredly , he 
will not remain seated upon his throne when an attack 
is in progress! You have not ceased being a Dungeon 
Master by using this prepared scenario; you have simply 
had some details handled for you so that you can better 
script the more important material. 
When the party retires from the hall to rest, the fire 
giants will lay whatever traps and ambushes they are 
able to prepare under the circumstances. Lights will be 
smothered, sentries posted, and so forth. In the original 
playtest, the giants who survived the first foray by the 
(exceptionally strong and well-played) party set several 
ambushes, each surprise being timed to allow them to 
retreat quickly behind a turn in a passage or through 
a set of doors, gradually falling back to the corridor to 
the lower level. While the characters offered no quarter 
and slew every giant or other creature encountered with 
absolute ruthlessness, their opponents fought with reck­
less abandon and self-sacrifice. 
How you manage this conflict in your game must be 
based on knowledge that only you can have. The upshot 
of this whole series of adventures is a fight to the finish. 
Only the leaders and those they take with them will 
normally seek to move to a place of safety; the rest will 
stand fast and battle to the end. 
ADVENTURE START 
The party might have arrived before the huge obsid­
ian valves that bar entrance to the hall by means of 
the transporter found in the lair of the frost giant jar!. 
In this case, they will have to search to find a place of 
safety to rest and recover their strength between forays 
into the hall. 
If the group journeyed hence by some other method, 
they will have noted such a place of refuge about two 
miles distant from Snurre's sooty palace. This hidden 
site should initially prove to be safe from detection 
as long as the characters leave no plain trail to it and 
as long as they are not followed to it. There is a limit, 
though, to how far they can push their luck. Each time 
they venture forth from their refuge to raid the fire gi­
ant hall, there is a 10 percent cumulative chance that 
the hidey-hole will be found by the giants (a 10 percent 
chance after the first raid, 20 percent following the sec­
ond, and so forth). 
A nearby ravine leads directly from the safe cave to 
the spiny, broken heap of slag indicated on the char­
acters' map as the site of the hall. A wide, well-trod 
path winds its way across the barren land up to two 
great slabs of black stone-the obsidian portals that 
CHAPTER 6 I A(,AINSTTHE GIANTS 

--- PAGE 193 ---

192 give access to Snurre's hall. Each valve is 29 feet tall, 
10 feet wide, and no less than 3 feet thick. Normal hu­
man strength cannot even budge them; for Medium or 
smaller creatures to open them requires at least two 
characters working together to make a successful DC 
25 Strength (Athletics) check. On the second and any 
successive raids upon the place, there is a 50 percent 
likelihood that the gates will be ajar, and some guard 
will be watching for attackers in order to alert the hall. 
The plain around the stronghold is most evil and drab 
in appearance. The sky is gray and filled with sooty 
clouds. A distant volcano can be seen, and far to the 
south a glowing river of molten lava moves sluggishly 
down a slope and out of sight. The air is hot and smells 
of heated rock and metal. The ground is covered with 
cinders and sharp rocks that make walking cross-coun­
try difficult (and noisy). The area is lit by night with 
dim red light, both from flaming gases that shoot forth 
out of the bowels of the earth and from the glow of 
molten rock. 
The pile of lava, slag, and jutting black rock that 
houses the Hall of Snurre is a steeply rising hill about 
300 feet high at its summit. It is difficult to scale. Smok­
ing vents are everywhere, and some of these holes spurt 
out jets of flame from time to time. The characters will 
never locate any entrance into the place other than by 
the main gate, and there is a 33 percent chance that any 
member investigating a vent hole will be struck by flam­
ing gases for 7 (2d6) fire damage. 
ENTRANCE LEVEL: GENERAL 
FEATURES 
Map 6.5 shows the layout of the uppermost level of the 
fire giant stronghold. The floors, walls, and ceilings 
throughout the place are of black, reddish-black, dark 
gray, and dull brown rock. In some places the stone 
has been hewn, but in others it appears to have been 
fused by heat. 
Ceilings. Passageways in the hall have vaulted ceil­
ings 30 feet high. Caves, chambers, and rooms are 40 to 
60 feet high. 
Doors. All doors are made of iron plates. A Medium 
or smaller creature must succeed on a DC 15 Strength 
(Athletics) check to open any of the doors in this place 
due to their great size and weight. Doors stay open if 
left that way. 
lllumination. The upper level of Snurre's hall is lit by 
torches, braziers, and natural gas jets. 
Locks. The hall contains numerous well-made locks. 
Someone using thieves' tools can pick a lock with a suc­
cessful DC 20 Dexterity check. 
Secret Doors. Secret doors in the hall are precisely 
crafted. Unless otherwise noted, it requires a successful 
DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check to find such a door. 
RANDOM ENCOUNTERS 
On the entrance level of the fire giant stronghold, the 
chance of a random encounter occurs on an hourly 
basis. At the end of each hour, roll a dl2. On a roll of 1, 
which indicates a random encounter, choose from the 
following possibilities: 
CHAPTER 6 [ AGAINST THE GIANTS One fire giant guard 
One fire giant with 12 gnoll workers 
Four young fire giants (use the ogre statistics, plus im­
munity to fire damage) with two hell hounds 
One cloud giant, one frost giant, or one stone giant, a 
\'i itor looking around 
LOCATIONS ON THE ENTRANCE 
LEVEL -
The following locations are identified on map 6.5. 
l. E TRY PASSAGE 
The floor here is polished obsidian, and great wall hang­
ings can be seen by the characters as soon as they enter. 
The tapestries displayed between the torches are ren­
dered in bloody colors and show victorious fire giants. 
The door guard is hidden in the alcove (area lA). 
lA. ALCOVE 
The tapestry that covers the opening to this guard post 
is of loose weave, allowing the fire giant guard in the 
dark recess to clearly see whoever enters the corridor. If 
intruders are spotted, he sounds his great bronze horn 
to warn the hall (see area 2). The giant has four rocks 
for throwing. 
If the characters are returning after severely defeating 
the giants, a ballista (from the arsenal at lOA) will be set 
up at the far end of the hallway in anticipation of a sec­
ond raid. This weapon is triggered by a nearly invisible 
tripwire set 30 feet inside the entrance, and someone 
must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check to 
find the wire. Once the wire is found, it can be avoided, 
but cutting it sets off the ballista. The ballista fires an 
array of bolts down the length of the hall, so each crea­
ture in it is subjected to one attack at a +6 bonus to hit, 
dealing 11 (2d10) piercing damage on a hit. 
2. GRAND HALL 
Two ettins are always in the hall that runs east-west 
off the entry passage, using their four heads to watch in 
all directions. If the guard at the gate sounds the alarm, 
these creatures move to hold the mouth of the entryway 
until help arrives from area 3, area 18, or areas 21-25. 
The floor of the grand hall is of reddish-black, highly 
polished stone. The pillars are carved into the shapes 
of dwarves, each straining to hold up the figure atop 
it. Light flickers weirdly from burning gases that spurt 
from the walls. One of the tapestries on the south wall 
screens the entrance to the royal apartment (areas 4-7). 
3. THRONE ROOM AND AUDIENCE CHAMBER 
Two steps of white-veined black marble lead up to an 
area where the floor is of deep red polished stone, Be­
tween two pillars of polished obsidian sits a massive 
throne made of jet and black-and-white-banded onyx, 
the whole inlaid with various large gems. The walls are 
inlaid with colored stone laid out to show various scenes 
of victory by King Snurre over his foes. On the wall 
directly behind the throne is depicted the flaming skull 
which is Snurre's own device, flanked by fire giants with 
clubs over their shoulders. The northern one of these 
inlaid giant-images conceals a secret door hidden in the 

--- PAGE 194 ---

wall; a cresset to the left of it, when pu 
the portal to swing inward. 
King Snurre is seated on the black ea 
Over 19 feet tall, he is hugely muscled a 
narily ugly-very broad, with bandy leg . • -
tusk-like and protruding, his side whi -e a 
bright orange and full. Snurre is clad in blac -o plate 
armor, and he wields a huge greatsword tha display 
flames running along its blade when it i wung. The 
king wears a necklace of coral skulls and ha a broad 
girdle set with small gems. Around hi houlder i a 
cape made of white dragon hide. 
When he sits on the throne, he wear hi jewel-tud­
ded crown of iron. Otherwise the crown i in hi bag 
and his bald pate covered by an iron helmet. 
King Snurre is a fire giant with the following changes, 
which increase his challenge rating to 11 (7,200 XP): 
He has 187 (15d12 + 90) hit points. 
He has resistance to cold damage. 
He can speak Common and Giant. 
His greatsword deals an extra 7 (2d6) fire dam­
age on a hit. 
Two fire giants guard the king at all times; their po­
sitions are indicated by the circled numbers 1 and 2. 
Each giant has a carved stone to throw. Crouching at 
positions 3 and 4 are a pair of hell hounds, the king's 
constant companions. 
Treasure. Snurre's crown is set with six rubies (worth 
500 gp each), six diamonds (500 gp each), and a huge 
jacinth (1,000 gp). His necklace has a value of 1,000 
gp, and his girdle is decorated with sixty-six garnets 
(worth 10 gp each). His magic cape grants resistance to 
cold damage. 
The gems embedded in Snurre's throne include twelve 
pieces of sard (worth 100 gp each), twelve fire opals 
(worth 250 gp each), and twelve rubies (500 gp each). 
4. CHAMBER OF THE QUEEN'S SERVANTS 
The walls of the grand hall are covered with hide rugs 
and wall hangings, one of which screens the entrance to 
the queen's private chamber . 
Inside this entryway are torches on the walls, and six 
chairs and three small tables along the hallway. At the 
end of the route westward is a chamber that holds four 
beds, four chests, two wardrobes, and four stools. 
Three fire giant servants (use the hill giant statistics , 
plus immunity to fire damage) are present here, one 
waiting outside the queen's chamber and two more 
in the end chamber. Each fights fiercely to protect the 
queen, with those at the end chamber rushing to aid the 
other. The servants wield longswords that deal 18 (3d8 
+ 5) slashing damage on a hit. 
Treasure . Each of the servants wears three pieces 
of jewelry worth 250 gp apiece. Amid the eighty-one 
hides, pelts, skins, and furs in the end chamber are five 
of value-the seventeenth, twenty-fourth, fortieth, fif­
ty-ninth, and seventy-seventh items that the characters 
examine are worth 200 gp each. 
5. QUEEN'S CHAMBER 
The floors and walls in the chamber north of the ser­
vants' quarters are covered with rich rugs and tapestries 

--- PAGE 195 ---

194 of no great value. The place is well lit by torches and 
a large brazier, and this makes it very hot indeed Uust 
right for fire giants!). 
Queen Frupy, who resides here, is a veritable harri­
dan, a sly and cunning fire giant. She is, if anything , 
uglier than Snurre. Topped by a huge mass of yellow-or­
ange hair that looks like a fright wig, Queen Frupy's 
face is a mass of jowls and wrinkles set in the middle 
of a very large head that seems to grow directly out of 
her shoulders without the benefit of any neck. Her body 
is lumpy and gross, her skin covered with bristles the 
color of her hair. Her little pig eyes, however, are bright, 
suggesting intelligence unusual in a giant. 
Her chamber contains a giant-sized bed covered with 
furs, a table and two chairs, a stool, and a dressing table 
with a huge mirror of seeing (weighing 100 pounds) 
that functions similarly to a gem of seeing, so that even 
unseen creatures and objects are reflected in it. (Frupy 
uses it if she suspects invisible creatures are about.) 
Also here are an ebony and mother-of-pearl wardrob e 
(filled with her clothing) , an iron strongbox, a chest 
of twelve drawers, four small coffers of copper on the 
table, and two bronze caskets. Each bronze casket has 
a poisonous snake inside, which must be dealt with be­
fore the contents can be accessed (see "Treasure"). 
The queen wears garments of black dragon hide set 
with iron studs (giving her an AC equivalent to that of 
plate armor). She wields an iron scepter as a weapon 
(treat as a maul with the same statistics as a fire giant's 
greatsword, except that it deals bludgeoning damage). 
Out of sight under the bed are Frupy's two pets, a pair of 
giant weasels that obey her every command . 
If intruders enter the place, Queen Frupy will com­
mand them to kneel in her august presence and state 
their business, so that she may fairly address their hum­
ble requests. Any who are so foolish as to do so will be 
sorry, as Frupy will call forth her pets and herself strike 
at the intruder who appears to be the most powerful. 
(A kneeling character is considered to be prone in this 
situation .) She will then bellow for her servants to come 
to her aid. 
Treasure. One of the bronze caskets holds 400 cp, 
and the other one has 300 pp concealed beneath a layer 
of 100 cp. 
If the lid of the strongbox is opened by anyone but 
Frupy, a glyph of warding inside is triggered, producing 
a fireball spell centered on the chest (save DC 15). The 
strongbox itself holds nothing of value, but it has a trick 
panel in the side, which requires a successful DC 20 
Wisdom (Perception) check to find. 
The panel, if opened, allows access to a jade box 
(worth 500 gp). This box has a false bottom, found with 
another successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check, 
that contains spell scrolls of two random 7th-level spells 
of a particular class (DM's choice). 
All but one of the copper coffers contain unguents and 
the like; the third coffer examined contains four pieces 
of gem-set gold jewelry worth 750 gp each. 
The drawers in the chest hold worthless personal arti­
cles, except for the fifth drawer from the bottom, where 
under some underthings Queen Frupy has concealed 
three potions: resistance (fire), mind control (mammal) , 
CHAPTER 6 I AGAINST THE GJANTS and mind concrol, fire giant), the latter of which she 
plan co u e on the king (see appendix A for the latter 
two potion ). 
Finally. Frupy wears six pieces of gem-set jewelry 
worth 500 gp each. 
6. CH,LfBER OF THE KING'S GUARDS 
Beyond the doors that lead north, along the east and 
,•.-e t walls of the short hallway, are a total of twelve 
throwing rocks lined up ready for use. Two fire giants, 
off-duty guards, relax in the adjoining chamber. Each 
has a carved throwing rock and a greatsword nearby. 
A table and two benches sit in the center of the room. 
The table has several platters and flagons on it, along 
with a small cask of wine and a wheel of cheese cov­
ered with mold. Two wooden lockers are tucked under 
the table. 
Treasure. Hidden inside the cheese in a hollowed-out 
space are five 100 gp gems. (This is the repository for 
the wealth of the on-duty guards.) 
Each of the lockers contains ordinary clothing and 
150 gp. Each guard carries three gems worth 100 gp 
each in a belt pouch, 
7. KING SNURRE's PRIVATE QUARTERS 
The great iron doors to this place bear the blazon of the 
flaming skull also found in the throne room. The doors 
open into an outer hall where six hell hounds roam. 
The walls in the outer hall are set with torches in 
cressets and draped with crude tapestries. Six chairs 
and two benches lie along the walls, along with three 
tables-each with a keg of ale, beer, or mead and drink­
ing vessels of horn or leather at hand. A small step up 
on either side of a natural stone column of reddish stone 
marks the end of the outer hall and the entry to the 
king's private chamber. 
The bedchamber of the king is lit in an eerie manner 
by flaming jets of gas and a huge iron brazier full of 
glowing coals. The room contains a huge, fur-covered 
bed, a table, a small throne of ebony and three lesser 
chairs, a tall cabinet, four trunks, an iron chest at the 
foot of the bed, and a bench near the entry. The floor is 
covered with pelts, and the walls are hung with tapes­
tries and trophies: two shields, an axe, four swords, a 
flail, and a hammer. All these items are sized for giants. 
A ledge on the south wall 9 feet above the floor holds 
thirty-nine skulls (human, dwarf, elf, giant, and other 
various and sundry creatures), eight helmets and helms, 
and five sets of armor (chain mail , splint, or plate as 
you desire). 
The containers in the room hold the personal gear of 
King Snurre, consisting of clothing, footwear, and bits 
of armor. Arrayed on the table are several small items 
including pieces of carved ivory, animal teeth, bits of 
wood, and stones. Together these items, the king be­
lieves, can be made to serve as a divination device. 
Treasure. Aside from all the mundane armor and 
weapons , the only item of value to be had here is one of 
the stones on the table, which is an uncarved piece of 
carnelian worth 100 gp. 
Secret Exit. A stone projects out of the wall to the left 
of the secret door, 12 feet above the floor. Pushing the

10 feet wide and 10 feet high. 
8. HYDRA CAVE 
A hydra lurks in either the north or the • a 
this area if it hears any creature coming up e "' ep­
toward its lair. The creature is very viciou_. a~ t e ·ng 
beats it and torments it for fun, and it hopes to take re­
venge on virtually any other living thing. 
9. KING SNURRE's TREASURE CAYE 
The chamber to the west of the hydra"s lair i filled with 
stuff, much of which is valueless or nearly o-a pile 
of 2,800 cp, three mounds of 4d4 worthle tapestries 
and furs, several dozen bales of valueless cloth. scores 
of various vessels and containers, and urns and vases 
of pewter and brass and bronze, plus ten urns of silver 
(worth 50 gp each) and two of gold (worth 500 gp each). 
A chimney in the southeastern part of the cave leads 
up through the roof. 
Treasure. The real wealth in the room is held inside 
nearly twenty different containers-eight iron trunks, 
six smaller chests, and five even smaller coffers. As the 
characters investigate and attempt to open them, they 
discover features and contents as follows. Opening a 
locked one requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity check 
using thieves' tools. 
Trunk 1 is locked. It contains 7,200 sp. 
Trunk 2 is locked. It contains nothing. 
Trunk 3 is unlocked and has no defenses. At the bot­
tom is s sack holding ten pieces of jewelry (worth 500 gp 
each). It is buried under a heap of 6,000 cp. 
Trunk 4 is locked and trapped. It contains 3 cubic 
feet of silk, worth 300 gp per cubic foot. If the trunk is 
opened without the key, a blade springs from the lid and 
chops down at one target, with a +11 bonus to hit and 
dealing 13 (3d8) slashing damage on a hit. With a suc­
cessful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character 
can spot alterations to the lock and hinges that are part 
of the trap mechanism . A successful DC 20 Dexterity 
check by someone using thieves' tools can be used to 
disable the hinge mechanism. If the trap goes off but the 
blade misses, it chops through 2 cubic feet of the silk, 
ruining it. 
Trunk 5 is locked. It contains eight pieces of rare 
wood, each the size of a mace and inlaid with mother-of­
pearl (worth 100 gp apiece). 
Trunk 6 is unlocked and has no defenses. It con­
tains 1,300 ep. 
Trunk 7 is locked. It contains ten fine ivory tusks each 
weighing 5 pounds and worth 150 gp. 
Trunk 8 is unlocked. When it is opened, it initially ap­
pears empty because all of its contents are invisible. The 
chest holds six pieces of jewelry worth 250 gp each as 
well as nine poisonous snakes. 
Chest 1 is unlocked and trapped. If its lid is lifted, 
poisonous gas billows forth and spreads out to fill a 
10-foot-radius area around it. Those within the cloud 
when it erupts must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution 
saving throw or become poisoned until they finish a 
short or long rest. The chest is empty. 
Chest 2 is locked. It contains worthless rocks. Chest 3 is unlocked and trapped. If its lid is lifted 
before the trap is disabled, acid sprays out from small 
holes in the sides, splattering anyone within 10 feet of 
the chest. Those in the affected area must make a DC 15 
Dexterity saving throw, taking 7 (3d4) acid damage on a 
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 
With a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check, 
a character discovers that the hinges are connected 
to a valve, disguised as a decoration , that pressurizes 
the acid in the chest walls. The trap can be disabled by · 
someone who uses thieves' tools and succeeds on a DC 
20 Dexterity check. 
To determine the contents of the chest, consult chap­
ter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide. Roll four times on 
Magic Item Table A, two times on Table B, two times on 
Table C, once on Table D, and once on Table E. Any re­
sult that is not a potion or a scroll should be disregarded 
but not rerolled. 
Chest 4 is unlocked and trapped. It contains 1,600 gp. 
If its lid is lifted before the trap is disabled, numerous 
spikes shoot forward, backward, and to each side. Each 
spike has a range of 15 feet and a +11 bonus to hit, deal­
ing 7 (2d6) piercing damage on a hit. Anyone within 15 
feet of the chest might be hit. With a successful DC 20 
Wisdom (Perception) check, a character notices that the 
hinges are connected to four valves, disguised as dec­
orations, that pressurize the spikes in the chest walls. 
Thieves' tools and a successful DC 20 Dexterity check 
can be used to disable the valves. 
Chest 5 is locked. It contains nothing. 
Chest 6 is locked and trapped. It contains a cloak of 
elvenkind and a pair of boots of elvenkind. The lock 
and the chest's handles are coated with oil of taggit (see 
"Sample Poisons" in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master's 
Guide). With a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) 
check, a character spots the oil. A character who suc­
ceeds on a DC 15 Intelligence check, or any character 
who has proficiency with a poisoner's kit, knows that 
the oil can be wiped off with alcohol, although doing so 
without wearing protective clothing is risky, requiring a 
successful DC 15 Dexterity check. On a failed check, the 
character is exposed to the poison. 
Coffer 1 is unlocked and trapped. It contains thirty 
gold rings, one of which is a ring of protection . The oth­
ers are ordinary rings worth 50 gp each. If the treasure 
is touched before the trap is disabled, a poison needle 
shoots from the inner side of the coffer, hitting the ex­
tremity that was extended. The needle deals 1 piercing 
damage and delivers a dose of purple worm poison (see 
"Sample Poisons" in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master's 
Guide). With a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) 
check, a character discovers the recess in the coffer 
wall that holds the needle. A character can remove the 
needle, thereby disabling the trap, by using thieves' tools 
and making a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. 
Coffer 2 is locked. It contains 200 pp concealed be­
neath a layer of 500 cp. 
Coffer 3 is locked. It holds packets of leaves and seeds 
and husks-various hot spices worth a total of 100 gp. 
Coffer 4 is unlocked. It contains six small, highly 
crafted, carved statues of unknown mineral and work­
manship. All register as desecrated objects to the scru-

196 tiny of Divine Sense or a detect evil and good spell. Each 
idol is associated with a different ability score. While 
one is carried, its bearer has disadvantage on all d20 
rolls involving that particular ability score. 
Coffer 5 is locked. It holds sixteen gems (worth 250 
gp each) concealed beneath a layer of two hundred 
gems worth 10 gp each, further topped by five hundred 
gems of good size and fine appearance but worth only 
1 gp each. 
10. ARSENAL COMPLEX 
A fire giant is always at the ready inside the entrance to 
this storage area. If summoned or attacked, the guard 
fetches the chimera from area 11. The guard has three 
throwing rocks at hand. Torches provide light, and a 
bench offers a place to sit down. 
JOA. West Arsenal. The western wing contains 
fifteen huge swords, a ballista, twenty spears, three 
maces, five greataxes, and a quantity of giant-sized 
throwing rocks. 
Treasure. Hidden in the far southwestern corner un­
der the spears are a +l longbow and a quiver of twenty 
+l arrows. 
JOB. East Arsenal. The eastern wing has another 
supply of throwing rocks, five massive clubs, nine fire 
giant helmets, two chain shirts, eight shields, and eight 
studded leather jacks-all giant-sized. Eight big barrels 
of oil are stored along the east side of the area. 
Treasure. One of the giant-sized shields is actually a 
shield of missile attraction. 
11. CHIMERA PEN 
The fire giants keep a chimera here. This creature at­
tacks intruders on sight, since it hates everyone except 
fire giants. 
12. ADVISOR'S QUARTERS 
A corridor heads westward from the pillared hallway. 
The corridor and the chamber beyond contain furnish-
CHAPTER 6 I AGAINST THE GIANT ing of rnrious sizes. The smallest of them are a table, 
a plu h chair with a footstool, and a couch. Other items 
are more or less human-sized, including a long table, 
two benches. two chairs, and twelve chests. Finally, 
there are four huge chairs, a table, and a footstool sized 
for giants. Rugs on the floor, tapestries on the walls, 
and bronze cressets with flaming torches complete 
the decor. 
Eight gnoll servants/bodyguards are lounging in this 
area. awaiting orders. They obey only the commands of 
King Snurre, Queen Frupy, or the Advisor-who is is a 
grossly fat but very strong and quite fast renegade moun­
tain dwarf named Obmi (see area 12A). 
Treasure. The chests contain the treasure of each 
gnoll (amounting to 50 gp each) plus the gnolls' personal 
gear. The third, eighth, tenth, and twelfth chests that the 
characters examine are locked; they contain bottles of 
wine and spirits. 
12A. 0BMI'S STUDY 
The door to this study appears to be locked from the 
outside, suggesting that the place is vacant (Obmi is very 
clever). He can see through the door by means of a peep­
hole, and if he sees intruders who are battling the gnolls 
and winning he will yell for them to help him, claiming 
to be a victim and a prisoner of the giants. 
In fact, at first sight, this chamber appears to be a cell 
rather than a truly comfortable study. Obmi is at work 
in the room, poring over several scrolls atop his plain 
wooden desk, searching for solutions for the problems 
besetting his King. The dwarf has been Snurre's advi­
sor for twenty-five years, having spent five years as a 
slave before that. A case against the north wall contains 
various maps, scrolls, and papers, all written in Giant 
or Dwarvish. 
If he finds himself at a disadvantage , Obmi (use the 
assassin statistics, with 16 Strength and Charisma 
and the ability to make three melee attacks using Mul­
tiattack) tells the characters that the giants have held

king will be. 
While in his study, Obmi has only a cudded lea her 
jacket and a long knife (the equivalenc of a hon5word. 
coated with one dose of the poison noced in che a sa sin 
statistics). If worst comes to worst, he bolt for room 
12B and bars the door once he is inside. 
Treasure. Obmi uses a plain wooden box a a foot­
stool. It seemingly holds only old clothes of his-but 
beneath a false bottom, which requires a successful 
DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to find, some gems 
are hidden: two worth 500 gp each, eight worth 100 gp 
each, twenty-three worth 50 gp each, forty-one worth 10 
gp each, and eighteen worth 5 gp each. 
12B. 0BMI'S BEDCHAMBER 
In a larger chamber adjacent to his study, the renegade 
dwarf has a soft bed, a small stand, a table and chair, 
a cabinet, two iron chests, and an arming rack. His 
dwarven plate and +1 shield (AC 20, or AC 23 with his 
shield) are laid on the rack near the door, and his +1 bat­
tleaxe and +1 warhammer (each deals ld8 + 4 damage 
in Obmi's hands) hang on the wall above. Underneath 
the armor are his gauntlets of ogre power (giving him 
an additional +l to attack and damage rolls with melee 
weapons) . His ring of invisibility is on a small stand 
near his bed. 
Upon entering the room Obmi will palm the ring, don 
the armor, put on the gauntlets, thong the axe to his belt. 
heft the hammer, and grab the shield. At the first good 
opportunity he will attack the party and raise a cry for 
help, but he will do so only when he knows help will be 
able to come. He knows a bit about the drow, and he will 
bargain with that information, or anything else, to save 
his life. If offered no quarter, he will fight to the very end. 
Treasure. In addition to Obmi's magical gear, both of 
the iron chests contain valuables. One chest holds 900 
gp. The other holds 100 pp and a bejeweled silver ewer 
and silver bowl (each item worth 500 gp). 
13. COUNCIL ROOM 
The king and his council meet in this large chamber, 
but the place is now empty. A long table near the center 
of the room has five great chairs around it. Hides cover 
parts of the polished black floor. Rude tapestries adorn 
the walls and are also hung across the openings around 
the perimeter of the room. There are several torches in 
the place, but none are lit. 
13A. WEST ALCOVE 
Within the alcove to the west is a table with a flat chest 
on it, locked and full of stones (weighing 200 pounds). If 
the chest is lifted or moved, a pressure plate underneath 
it shifts, causing six poisoned arrows to hoot out from 
the north wall. Each arrow has a range of 100 feet and 
a +11 bonus to hit; it deals 5 (ldlO) piercing damage on 
a hit, and the target struck must make a DC 11 Consti-cution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) poison damage on 
a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful 
one). The arrows strike the south wall and shatter if they 
miss interposing creatures. 
The holes for the arrows are sealed with a thin crust 
of mortar. A character who examines the wall spots 
them with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) 
check. Someone who looks carefully at the base of the 
chest can spot the pressure plate with a successful 
DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. The holes can be 
blocked by hammering iron pitons or similar objects 
into them. The pressure plate can be wedged in place 
with the use of at least two such objects. In either case, 
a character attempting to disarm the trap must succeed 
on a DC 10 Strength check. On a failed check, the trap 
operates anyway when the attempt to block it fails. 
Treasure. A map of the area around the stronghold 
hangs on the western wall. Two locked chests rest 
against the north and south walls-the northern one 
filled with 850 sp, the southern one holding 500 gp and 
six bone batons with Dwarvish runes upon them. 
Each of the batons is a token of free passage whose 
runes read, in Giant, "Official Business on Behalf of 
King Snurre the Fearsome." Any individuals or groups 
that display one of these items are safe from attacks by 
the giants or the giants' allies as long as they take no 
aggressive action. 
13B. SOUTH ALCOVE 
Four extra chairs for the council table are stored in the 
alcove to the south, and a huge cabinet holds eighty­
three scrolls and three hundred sixty-seven pieces of 
paper or parchment. 
Most of the cabinet's contents are worthless and of 
no import, but the sixty-eighth scroll tube contains in­
structions for King Snurre, telling him to gather forces 
of hill, stone, frost, and fire giants, along with whatever 
strength he can raise in ogres, oni, cloud giants, and any 
other creatures for an all-out attack on humankind. The 
message further promises powerful help from the dark 
elves. It is signed "Eclavdra." 
The papers are copies of messages to and replies from 
various types of giants and giant-kin. One, in Dwarvish, 
reads, "The fire giant of stone left and left elbow." 
14. DOOR GUARD 
A fire giant stands guard at all times outside the doors 
to the council chambers. 
15. KITCHEN 
Benches, counters, a table, several stools, three 
cupboards, various bins and barrels, and miscellaneous 
kitchen gear are scattered around the kitchen. The area 
to the west is a natural firepit, where flaming gases are 
used to roast whole creatures. 
The place is typically occupied by busy workers: a fire 
giant matron, two fire giant servants (use the hill giant 
statistics, plus immunity to fire damage), and seven 
gnoll thralls. The servants and the gnolls fight only un­
der the direction of the matron, fleeing or surrendering 
if she falls. 
Slippery Exit. The chute to the northwest goes down 
to the lava pool on the second level (area 6 on map 6.6). 
CHAPTER 6 AGAIN'if THE GIANTS 197 

--- PAGE 199 ---

Six feet in diameter, it is slippery and greasy from gar­
bage and empties out 2 feet above the lava. 
16. STORAGE CHAMBER 
The room near the kitchen is jammed full of barrels of 
ale and mead, boxes, sacks, hampers, and wheels of 
cheese. Overhead hang smoked sides of meat, smoked 
fish, strings of sausages, and the like. There are smaller 
boxes of salt, and a screw-top copper container filled 
with spices (wonderfully hot peppers). Tuns of wine and 
casks of beer are kept handy near the door. The most 
common item, heaps of hard bread, is everywhere. 
17. GUEST CHAMBER 
The doors to this room are closed on the outside by a 
great bar, because King Snurre does not fully trust his 
guest, a rakshasa, that resides herein. Naturally, most 
adventurers will assume a creature thus imprisoned 
might become a trusted associate-an attitude the rak­
shasa will encourage by taking some benign form (such 
as that of a fellow adventurer, a kindred soul, who has 
been deprived of equipment) to gain the characters' con­
fidence before it attacks. 
Inside are four beds, a table and two chairs, two 
stools, and other furnishings including three chests and 
a footstool (in reality a treasure chest). Rugs and tapes­
tries adorn the floor and walls, and flaming torches in 
sconces provide light. 
Treasure. The rakshasa carries 50 gp and two 
gems (worth 100 gp each). The disguised chest holds a 
jeweled scepter worth 1,000 gp, three potions (superior 
healing, mind reading, and invulnerability), and five 
spell scrolls (zone of truth, true seeing, darkness, cure 
wounds cast at 4th level, and symbol). 
18. BARRACKS 
Currently two fire giants and two fire giant servants 
(use the hill giant statistics, plus immunity to fire dam­
age) are housed here. They typically lounge around 
sharpening weapons and telling lies about their ama­
tory prowess. 
The room has eight cots, four stools, and four ham­
pers. Each cot is heaped with skins. The hampers con­
tain the giants' personal gear. Pegs on the walls hold 
their bags and cloaks. There are five clubs, three axes, 
six spears, and eight shields scattered about, mostly 
along the north wall. The place is lit by flaming gas jets. 
Treasure. One of the clubs, noticeably lighter than 
the others, has been hollowed out to serve as a treasure 
cache. It holds 15 pp, 30 gp, 15 ep, 25 sp, 184 cp, and 
three 100 gp gems. 
19. SERVANTS' QUARTERS 
This room currently holds four fire giant servants (use 
the hill giant statistics, plus immunity to fire damage). 
The others that live here are presently at work in the 
kitchen (area 15). This torch-lit chamber has seven cots, 
various pieces of smaller furniture, and pegs on the 
walls that hold garments and the like. 
Treasure. Each servant has a piece of silver jewelry 
worth 100 gp. 
CHAPTER 6 I AGAINST THE GIANTS 20. Co~rn:u, AL QUARTERS 
Three fire giant servants (use the hill giant statistics, 
plu immunity to fire damage) care for six young fire gi­
ant (use the ogre statistics, plus immunity to fire dam­
age) in this vast chamber. All have weapons (kids' toys 
for the youngsters) and will fight with enthusiasm. 
There are three beds and six cots along the walls. In 
each wing is a bench, three chairs, six stools, a long ta­
ble. and various boxes, hampers, and cupboards. 
Treasure. Each servant has a piece of silver jewelry 
worth 100 gp. 
21. E TRY HALL OF THE KENNELS 
Four hell hounds scuffle and play just inside the doors. 
They are part of the pack at area 22 and will flee thereto 
by the safest route if threatened. 
22. KENNEL CHAMBER 
Four hell hounds are here. If those in area 21 are at­
tacked and yelp for assistance, these beasts split into 
pairs and station themselves in the north and south 
ends of the open area, from where they spring to the aid 
of the others. The hell hounds love their handler at area 
23 and come to his rescue if he whistles. 
The kennel contains no treasure, other than 
the hounds' prized bones (of interest only to other 
hell hounds). 
23. KENNEL KEEPER'S QUARTERS 
Herein dwell the Keeper and his mate, two fire giants 
who will rush to the aid of their charges if they hear a 
commotion outside. Their chamber contains a large bed, 
a table, two chairs, a bench, a chest, a cabinet, three 
barrels (beer, mead, and ale), two buckets (his and hers), 
and a crate (holding dried meat for the hounds). Burning 
torches light the place. Pegs on the walls hold wearing 
apparel and the giants' bags. A shield, a battleaxe, and 
a javelin lean against the wall to the north. Hides and 
pelts decorate the floor and walls, and a number of skins 
and furs are heaped on the bed and the bench. 
Treasure. The second bucket has a false bottom, 
which requires a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Percep­
tion) check to find. Beneath it are stored 20 pp and eight 
gems (worth 100 gp each). 
The javelin leaning against the wall is actually a jave­
lin of lightning. 
One of the six cloaks on the bench is a hell hound 
cloak (see appendix A). Wrapped inside this cursed 
cloak is a sword of vengeance. There are three other hell 
hound hides in the chamber (those of beloved departed 
pets), all quite normal. 
24. GUARDPOST 
A fire giant is on duty here at all times with four throw­
ing rocks nearby. An iron cylinder hanging near the 
north wall is a gong to be sounded if intruders are seen. 
25.BARRACKS 
Two fire giant warriors and two fire giant servants (use 
the hill giant statistics, plus immunity to fire damage) 
are lounging among the cots, chests, and other furniture 
that fill this place. Several pegs here and there hold 

--- PAGE 200 ---

cloaks, capes, shields, and four giant · ba,,.s -
only worthless giant-sized items in the c e:: er 
containers. 
One warrior has a greatsword , and the ot e-o e 
fights with a human-sized +2 greataxe. The ,eapo 
gives the giant a +13 bonus to hit and deals!::! 3 :::: -9) 
slashing damage. The room also has twen _·-one row­
ing rocks, which all the giants will use if· e oppo umty 
presents itself. 
Treasure. The easternmost of the three pillars has 
a secret hatch (equivalent to a secret door) concealing 
a hollowed-out space that contains 800 gp and three 
pieces of gem-studded jewelry (worth 500 gp each). 
SECOND LEVEL: GENERAL FEATURES 
Map 6.6 shows the layout of the second level of the 
fire giant stronghold. The floors, walls, and ceilings 
throughout the area are of black, reddish-black , dark 
gray, and dull brown rock. In some places the stone 
has been hewn, but in others it appears to have been 
fused by heat. 
Ceilings. Passageways have vaulted ceilings 30 
feet high. Caves, chambers, and rooms are 40 to 60 
feet high. 
Doors. All doors are made of iron plates. A Medium 
or smaller creature must succeed on a DC 15 Strength 
(Athletics) check to open any of the doors in this place 
due to their great size and weight. Doors stay open if 
left that way. 
IlJumination. Light is provided by torches, braziers, 
natural gas jets, and molten lava. 
Locks. The hall contains numerous well-made locks. 
Someone using thieves' tools can pick a lock with a suc­
cessful DC 20 Dexterity check. 
Secret Doors. Secret doors on this level are precisely 
crafted. Unless otherwise noted, it requires a successful 
DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check to find such a door. 
RANDOM ENCOUNTERS 
On the second level of the fire giant stronghold, the 
chance of a random encounter occurs on an hourly 
basis. At the end of each hour, roll a dl2. On a roll of 1, 
which indicates a random encounter, choose from the 
following possibilities: 
One fire giant and one fire giant servant (use the hill 
giant statistics, plus immunity to fire damage) 
One troll escorting one hill giant, one stone giant, or 
one frost giant 
• One troll with ten gnolls 
, One drow mage with five wererats 
LOCATIONS ON THE SECOND LEVEL 
The following locations are identified on map 6.6. 
1. HALL OF THE DEAD 
This dark hall contains twenty huge sarcophagi stand­
ing upright against the walls, and four even larger ones 
lying on the floor in the center of the chamber. Those 
four are made of stone, and the northern two have like­
ness of fire giants carved into their lids. while the south­
ern two are blank. Of the sarcophagi that line the walls, half are made of 
stone, six are crafted from bronze, two are brass, and 
two are iron. All of them bear likenesses of fire giant 
kings and queens. 
Examination will reveal that each of these burial 
vaults contains only the remains of a king or a queen, 
moldering garments, a few corroded weapons, and sim­
ilar worthless items (wererat grave robbers stole any­
thing of value long ago). 
Secret Exit. The tunnel behind the secret door in the 
southeast corner is about 5 feet in diameter . It twists 
and turns so that any person using it will lose all sense 
of direction before exiting at area 2 on map 6.7. 
2. ETTIN GUARDS' CHAMBER 
Four ettins reside here when they are not on duty near 
the main entrance to the grand hall (map 6.5, area 2). 
Two are asleep, their weapons within easy reach, while 
the other two quite alert. The chamber has a rude table, 
a bench, two stools, and four cots. Torches light the 
place. Nine pegs on the walls hold clothing and six gi­
ants' bags. 
Treasure. In the northwest corner is a hamper with 
six sacks, each holding 600 cp (which is the ettins' accu­
mulated pay). 
3. VISITORS' CHAMBER 
The doors to the north open into a room that houses two 
stone giants who have been working for King Snurre 
as engineers. The room, lit by torches, contains four 
cots, a large table, other furnishings, and pegs that hold 
clothing and two giants' bags. Eleven throwing rocks 
are scattered on the floor. A haunch of meat rests on the 
table along with mugs and platters of tin. 
Treasure. Each giant has 250 gp and a gem 
(worth 100 gp). 
4. STORAGE ROOM 
This room, illuminated by four torches set in wall 
cressets, has been cleaned out to serve as quarters for 
four hill giants. If they survived or escaped the assault 
on the steading, Chief Nosnra and his wife are among 
the occupants. 
If only ordinary hill giants are here, the room contains 
nothing more than four heaps of skins for bedding, a 
table, and two chests. 
If Nosnra and Grutha are present, the place has two 
cots, two heaps of skins, a trunk, a chain, a table, and 
two chests. 
Treasure. Ordinary hill giants carry 100 gp each but 
have no other treasure. The chief, if present, will have 
brought along whatever of his valuables he could sal­
vage and carry here. 
5. COMMUNITY QUARTERS 
In this large area are housed a fire giant warrior, three 
fire giant servants (use the hill giant statistics, plus im­
munity to fire damage), and four young fire giants (use 
the ogre statistics, plus immunity to fire damage). All 
are armed with various weapons, even the young, and 
there are twenty throwing rocks in the chamber. 
The place holds several beds, two large cabinets, two 
tables, miscellaneous smaller furniture , a crate, and

202portunity presents itself, she will heist as much in gems 
and magic as she can and then slip away-but until then 
she will help the characters to the best of her ability 
(both to better her own chances of staying alive in this 
awful place and to win their trust). During this time she 
will be casing the characters to learn what they carry. 
Ce1113C. The king's chief lieutenant , a fire giant 
named Boldo, hangs in chains as punishment for failing 
to be properly deferential to Snurre. He will do anything 
to get back into Snurre's favor. Thus, he will happily lie 
to the party and tell them he is here because he tried to 
prevent Snurre from taking his current hostile course. 
If freed, he tells the characters, he can get several other 
fire giants to aid them in overthrowing the king and re­
storing the peace. In fact, Boldo will betray the party at 
his earliest opportunity. He is quite bright, and he will 
not be rash. 
CeJJ 14C. Chained in the cell next to the guardroom 
is an empyrean (of chaotic good alignment). It has been 
drugged and is effectively unconscious. A character 
who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check 
can identify the effects of exposure to a virulent form of 
oil of taggit (see "Sample Poisons" in chapter 8 of the 
Dungeon Master's Guide). Magic, such as protection 
from poison or lesser restoration, can remove the poison 
from the empyrean's system. Otherwise, he recovers 
naturally in 12 hours. If awakened, he helps any party 
destroy the inhabitants of this place, although he would 
not mind seeing evil characters in the party die also. 
Guardroom (G). One fire giant guard and three 
wererats in human form (appearing as female humans 
in tattered clothing) are conversing here by torchlight. 
The giant has two rocks nearby. In the room are a table, 
a chair, a stool, a bench, three kegs on the floor, and a 
small, covered jar on the table. The first keg holds small 
beer, the second one water, and the third one mead. The 
jar contains oil of taggit; anyone who opens the jar is 
exposed to the poison and has disadvantage on the sav­
ing throw. On the walls are pegs holding a giant's bag, a 
cape, a shield, keys to the cells, and a shirt. 
If the guard is subdued and interrogated, he knows 
nothing of the secret tunnel to area 8 (and thus does not 
volunteer that information). If the disguised wererats are 
conversed with, they claim to be captives forced to labor 
for the giants as scullions. If they are attacked, the were­
rats assume the form of giant rats and escape through a 
drain hole in the northwest corner of the room, traveling 
from there to alert the drow of intruders. 
The secret door to the east opens into a passage about 
2 feet wide and 1 ½ feet high. It is rough, and a human 
in armor could not hope to pass along its length; even a 
halfling would have to struggle to get through it. 
Treasure. A loose stone in the floor to the east of the 
door hides a cache of 30 ep, 60 gp, and 21 pp. The guard 
wears a gemmed brooch (worth 100 gp) on his cloak. 
8. SECRET ROOM 
This place, pitch dark, is the lair of seven wererats. If 
the encounter is going badly for them, survivors flee 
down the northeast passageway to area 15 on the third 
level (map 6.7) and warn the drow. 
CHAPTER 6 I AGAINST THE GIANTS Aside from stolen cloaks piled here and there like 
ne the chief features in this secret room are three 
heavyiron chests. All are locked, and each key is on 
a di erent wererat. The chests are also trapped with 
poi on needles (see "Sample Traps" in chapter 5 of the 
Dungeon Master's Guide). The poison on these needles 
i oil of taggit (see "Sample Poisons" in chapter 8 of the 
Dungeon Master's Guide). 
The third chest the characters investigate is addition­
ally trapped so that two poisoned darts fire upward from 
the inside when the lid is opened. Each dart has a range 
of 30 feet and a +8 bonus to hit. It deals 2 (ld4) piercing 
damage on a hit and subjects its victim to exposure to 
drow poison (see "Sample Poisons" in chapter 8 of the 
Dungeon Master's Guide). The mechanism for this trap 
is inside the chest, thus it cannot be detected from the 
outside. A character who succeeds on a DC 20 Wisdom 
(Perception) check while beginning to open the lid no­
tices that it opens stiffly, with resistance from the inside. 
Those near the chest have a brief moment of warning 
before the lid springs fully open and the darts shoot 
forth; anyone who ducks down or lunges away from the 
chest can avoid being hit. 
Treasure. The first chest holds six pieces of jewelry 
worth 250 gp each, eight pieces worth 500 gp each, and 
three large pouches stuffed with 100 gp each. 
The second chest contains a potion of poison, 800 gp 
(loose), and a cursed scroll of protection (lycanthropes). 
Someone who reads the scroll must succeed on a DC 15 
Wisdom saving throw or become afflicted with wererat 
lycanthropy. 
The third chest is empty, but a permanent invisibil­
ity spell covers writing on the inside of the lid. If the 
invisibility is dispelled, the information tells where a 
stone in the wall along the stairs down can be removed 
to reveal a ring of shooting stars, a spell scroll of seven 
cleric spells (DM's choice), and a metal case holding 
six potions (healing, diminution, plus four more of the 
DM's choice). 
A secret compartment in the lid of the box that con­
tains the potions holds pipes of the sewers. A character 
who succeeds on a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check 
while examining the box finds the compartment. 
TEMPLE OF THE EYE (AREAS 9-11) 
Illusionary walls (represented by dashed lines on the 
map) screen the temple area from discovery. Making 
physical contact with these images reveals their illusory 
nature. Someone who examines either image without 
touching it can determine that it is an illusion by making 
a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. 
On a successful check, the illusions fade for that charac­
ter, becoming transparent enough to see through. 
Beyond the illusions, the whole place is illuminated by 
a strange, swirling light that seems to be part of the very 
air. Eddies of luminosity drift here and there, causing 
the whole scene to be difficult to perceive. Distances and 
dimensions are tricky to determine in the shifting light 
of rusty purple motes and lavender rays. Globs of mauve 
and violet seem to seep and slide around. The ceiling of 
the temple is out of visual range, 50 feet high at its low-

--- PAGE 204 ---

est point and well over 65 feet where it va
the center. 
9. Giants' Worship Area. Each pillar radt esa snse 
of unease and insecurity in a 5-foot radiussimulate
this by making players uneasy in whatever a__ youfind
best). The wall to the west is a mural howinggiant
bowing before a black cairn, offering sacri fice and give-
ing gifts. The floor in the western half of the area i of 
porphyry , and the pillars are made of serpentine. Their 
well-polished surfaces reflect the strange light that 
permeates the place. The scenes on the west wall grow 
more gruesome as the viewer proceeds north. culminat­
ing in scenes showing human and giant sacrifice near 
the end closest to the altar (area 11). 
10. Servants' and Thralls' Worship Area. The pol­
ished floor of red and black hornblende seems to flow 
between the thin pillars of obsidian that border this 
area. Each of these pillars radiates an aura of mild fear 
in a 2-foot radius, and if one is touched the creature who 
comes into contact with it must succeed on a DC 15 
Wisdom saving throw or be affected as if by a fear spell 
with the pillar as the object of its fear. Passing between 
two pillars causes a creature to take 5 (2d4) lightning 
damage, or double that if it is wearing metal armor. 
The wall to the east shows a scene of various crea­
tures submitting to a trio of huge, vaguely squid-like 
creatures, each with ten hairy tentacles and mottled in 
various shades and tints of purple and violet. In the fore­
front of this mass self-sacrifice are elves and humans, 
but there are also dwarves , gnolls, ores, trolls, halflings, 
ogres, goblins, and other creatures among the crowd. 
Those near the front of the line are being torn apart and 
the bloody gobbets eaten as dainty morsels. 
11. Priests' Area. The northern end of the temple is 
tiered, with three low steps that lead up toward the cen­
ter of the north wall. This wall, made of cloudy purple 
stone, displays an inlay of a huge inverted triangle with a 
Y shape enclosed in it and touching the triangle's sides. 
Hanging beneath this symbol, suspended on chains 
from the ceiling, is a black metal triangle and cylinder. 
The floor of the first tier is black stone shot through 
with veins of violet. A great drum of blackened skin and 
chitinous material rests on the western side of the first 
tier. On the eastern side is a rack from which hang nine 
silver cylinders, apparently a set of chimes. (these chime 
tubes are hollow and are worth 100 gp each). 
The large pillar to the east on the first tier is made of 
malachite and is covered with graven signs and sigils. A 
casting of detect magic reveals that the glyphs radiate an 
aura of conjuration magic. If the correct pair of gylphs 
are touched, the creature touching them will be trans­
ported to area 18 on the third level (see map 6.7). You 
should devise the twenty-four glyphs upon this pillar 
and select which two are the trigger mechanism. 
The second tier is dark gray stone, with specks of lilac 
and orange and purple. It holds a huge stone altar block 
of dull, porous-looking, somewhat rust-colored black 
mineral. To either side of the altar are large bronze bra­
ziers whose corroded green coloration is particularly 
nauseating in this setting. Flanking the braziers, in the 
form of triangles pointing downward. are two sets of 
candelabra, each candelabrum having three branches. These are made of bronze that is green with age, and 
each branch holds a fat black candle that burns with a 
flame of leaping lavender and deep glowing purple but 
never grows shorter. 
The third tier is dull black stone with whorls of plum 
and lavender and splotches of red. The metal triangle 
stands upon the third tier. If the altar stone is touched by 
living flesh or hit by a weapon (or any object), it begins 
to fade in color, and in 3 rounds becomes a translucent 
amethyst color with a black, amorphous center. A crea­
ture that touches or strikes the altar when it is in this 
form must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or 
become paralyzed for 1 hour. 
If the drum on the first tier is beaten, the chimes are 
rung, and the triangle is struck while the altar is in this 
translucent state, a glowing golden eye swims into view 
in the stone's writhing center. For each creature that 
sees the eye, roll a d12 and consult the following table. 
The creature is affected as if by a symbol spell of the in­
dicated type (save DC 15): 
d12 Result 
Death 
2 Discord 
3 Fear 
4 Hopelessness 
5 Insanity 
6-12 No effect (looked away in time) 
Except for the death effect, these effects are curses and 
can be removed only as such. 
If the three tentacle rods from area 12 are in the char­
acters' possession when the eye appears, and the bra­
ziers remain lit, then the altar becomes a means of sum­
moning an Elder Elemental God-it turns a transparent 
heliotrope in color, the black mass at the center grows 
larger and shows swollen veins of purple, and the eye 
is a fiery red-orange. Then a tentacle comes out of the 
altar and grabs the nearest living creature. The tentacle 
has a reach of 20 feet and a + 11 bonus to hit. A creature 
hit by the tentacle is drawn into the stone-totally gone, 
destroyed. 
If a creature is drawn into the altar, the altar re­
turns to its dormant state, and atop it will be the thing 
most wished for by the party-or something that will 
enable the characters to attain the end or state they 
most desire. 
If a second summoning of this Elder Elemental God is 
attempted within the same day, roll a dl2 and apply the 
indicated result from the table below. 
d12 Result 
Tentacles try to seize and devour ld4 more creatures 
within the minute, but entity does not grant any addi­
tional desires. 
2 Entity strikes everyone present permanently blind and 
does not grant any additional desires. 
3 Entity raises one ability score of each character pres­
ent by 1 point and takes no sacrifice. 
4-12 Entity ignores the whole thing. 
Treasure. The only items of value in the temple that 
can be salvaged are the silver chimes. Each hollow sil­
ver cylinder is worth 100 gp.

12. DROW CLERICS' AREA 
The entrance to this chamber is protected a all of 
tentacles (not depicted on the map). It appearsasrough 
brown-purple stone. This magic wall i like ropers 
combined into one creature , giving it two b e at ac k
and eight tendrils that it can employ everyround hough 
the tendrils have a range of only 20 feet The·all 
has resistance to bludgeoning , piercing. and lashing 
damage from nonmagical weapons . A ca tingof dispel 
magic deals the wall 50 damage, and disintegrate deals 
it 100 damage. 
Drow can freely pass through the wall If any other 
creature touches it, the wall attacks and emits a hiss­
ing and champing noise to alert the occupants of the 
chamber beyond it. If its current hit points drop to half 
its hit point maximum or lower, the wall casts darkness 
on itself (affecting only the outside of the wall, not its 
inner surface). 
The chamber south of the wall is lit by the same ever­
burning black candles that are found in the temple (area 
11), so the illumination is eerie and dim. The walls are 
hung with purple cloth, and the floor is thickly carpeted 
in black. The inner room to the east is screened off from 
the outer room by a brocaded hanging of black with or­
ange, gold, lilac, and mauve. 
Outer Chamber. The antechamber is the quarters of 
a drow elite warrior and a drow mage who assist their 
priestess , Eclavdra . Each has a tentacle rod in addition 
to its usual gear and weaponry . 
A smoldering copper brazier near the door gives off an 
incense-like smoke that is sweet, cloying, decayed-sm ell­
ing, disgusting , alluring, and euphoric all at once. In the 
candlelit room are two low black couches, each inlaid 
with silver. To one side sit a round table and two arm­
chairs. At the foot of each couch is a low table with a ba­
sin and ewer made of jasper. Small stools and enameled 
coffers provide a bit of decoration . 
Treasure . The jasper basins and ewers are worth 300 
gp per set. The first coffer examined holds a spell scroll 
of word of recall and three bars of adamantine , each 
weighing 5 pounds and worth 500 gp each. The second 
coffer contains 100 cp, 100 sp, 10 ep, 20 gp, and 10 pp, 
each type of coin in its own black leather pouch, as well 
as a pouch of ten gems (worth 50 gp each). 
Inner Chamber . The inner room, lavishly furnished 
and decorated , is the sanctuary of Eclavdra , the drow 
priestess ofLolth who has fomented all the trouble 
with the giants. Like her assistants , she also carries a 
tentacle rod in addition to her other equipment. 
Here the light from candles is supplemented by two 
small braziers of black and silver. Tapestries of a sug­
gestive nature adorn the walls. The furnishings include 
a large bed, two small tables, three coffers, a buffet, a 
cabinet, a large wardrobe , two divans with a low chest 
between them, a dressing table and chair, a large mir­
ror, two hampers , and two chests. All furnishings are 
of ebony or black stone, and most have silver inlay. The 
wardrobe holds feminine clothing and the priestess 's 
vestments of mauve, black, and plum, stitched with gold. 
A small screen of ebony inlaid with amber (weighing 
10 pounds and worth 150 gp) sets off a dressing area in the southeast corner near the wardrobe, where a low­
backed chair stands with a gown thrown over it. This 
screen effectively hides the location of the secret door, 
which enables the priestess to slip in and out unseen. 
Treasure . Many of the items in Eclavdra's chamber 
are of significant value. 
The priestess 's ceremonial garment is set with ten vio­
let garnets (worth 50 gp each), ten topazes (50 gp each), 
ten black opals (100 gp each), and ten amethysts (100 gp 
each); it is covered with a plain black wrapper to protect 
it from dust and damage. 
A coffer on the low chest between the divans has a 
glyph of warding on the inside of the lid, so if anyone 
other than Eclavdra opens it, the glyph casts insect 
plague (spell save DC 14). The container holds three 
spell scrolls (gate, divine word, and greater restoration). 
A coffer near her bed contains six potions: poison, 
mind control (fire giant) (see appendix A), growth, hero­
ism, and two philters of Jove. 
On the dressing table are two combs, a brush, four 
pins, and ten jars that hold unguents and cosmetics. 
These items are of onyx and silver, set with tiny gems. 
Each is worth 50 gp. 
Beside her bed on a small table are a basin, a ewer, 
and a goblet made from lapis lazuli (each is worth 500 
gp). The ebony-and-amber screen around the dressing 
area weighs 10 pounds and is worth 150 gp. The large 
mirror of silver is worth 50 gp.

13. GUEST CHAMBER 
Ifjarl Grugnur and his lady, Estia, survived the assault 
on che glacial rife. they will be sequestered in this cham­
ber. accompan ied by a frost giant that serves as a door 
guard. If che jar! and his lady are not present, the room 
concain two frost giants, recently arrived messengers. 
The place is dimly lit by a few torches. It holds eight 
cots,a long table, two benches, two chairs, three stools, 
two buckets, six chests, a large box, and a cabinet. 
Hides on the floors and pelts on the cots help to make 
this place more comfortable and familiar for frost giant 
guests. Pegs hold clothing and three giants' bags. 
Treasure. Each giant carries 100 gp. In addition, the 
jar! and his lady will have whatever loot they managed to 
salvage from their stronghold. 
14. GUEST CHAMBER 
Two cloud giants, a noble and his traveling companion , 
have come to hear from King Snurre why his war-
fare will profit them and make them more powerful. 
The giants have two lions serving as watch-animals 
at the door. The noble has a chain mail coat (AC 16), 
and both have their great morningstars and throwing 
rocks nearby. 
The chamber contains two very large beds, two ward­
robes, two small tables, a large table, two chairs, two 
stools, two buckets, a cabinet, a bench, and four chests. 
The place is illuminated by torchlight , and there are 
tapestries on the walls, rugs and hides on the floor, and 
furs on the beds. 
Treasure. On the small table near the bed to the south 
is a platinum box set with moonstones and sunstones 
(worth 1,000 gp) that holds ten gems (worth 100 gp 
each), which are a present to the visitors from the king. 
15. TROLLS' CHAMBER 
Six troll guards nest in this room. Two of them keep 
watch in the northern passage (within the area marked 
by Xs) and two others do the same in the southern 
passage. The other two monsters are in the central 
chamber. Dozens of various polearms , morningstars , 
and swords lie heaped in the middle of the room. (These 
are used to arm the gnolls currently penned in areas 
16 and 17.) 
Treasure. Each troll has a nest of sticks, bones, hide 
and skin scraps, and other nauseating material in which 
is hidden 50 gp. 
16. THRALL PEN 
Sixteen unarmed gnolls dwell here. Each has nothing 
but a heap of straw and a hide coverlet. Although these 
creatures are slaves of the giants, they identify with 
their masters' cause and will never help humans for any 
reason-in fact, they will gladly take up arms to fight in­
truders if given the chance. 
17. THRALL PEN 
Ten unarmed gnolls dwell here. They will behave in all 
respects like their kin in area 16. 

--- PAGE 208 ---

THIRD LEVEL: GENERAL FEATURES 
Map 6.7 shows the layout of the lowest le ·el of e fire 
giant stronghold. This place is entirely natural. the tun­
nels and caverns showing no marks of being hollowed 
out, except for the entranceway to the levelfrom above
and around the exit beyond the River of Lava.
As is usual with natural areas, do not worry overmuch
about describing direction of passages and wall of 
caves and caverns, let alone size and shape. Primitive 
mapping techniques under stress conditions would 
develop just about the same sort of chart as your play­
ers will when their characters explore this level ... 
wretched, but sufficient to get from place to place. If 
they have made it this far, they do not need any help 
from the DM! 
Ceilings. All passages are at least 20 feet high, small 
caves being 25 feet or so from floor to ceiling vault and 
large caverns anywhere from 25 to 75 feet high (areas 7, 
19, and 20 are among the highest). 
Illumination. Most areas here are dark and still; only 
a few are lit, such as the lava cavern (areas 19 and 20) 
and the giants' final refuge in a crisis (area 5). If you like, 
add a few patches of phosphorescent growth as dungeon 
dressing -the light making it possible to see movement 
across it but not sufficient to illuminate an area. 
Sounds. If the characters were to remain still, they 
might hear water dripping, and perhaps once and once 
only a far distant echoing of stone striking stone. 
RANDOM ENCOUNTERS 
On the third level of the fire giant stronghold, the chance 
of a random encounter occurs on an hourly basis. At the 
end of each hour, roll a dl2. On a roll of 1, which indi­
cates a random encounter, choose from the following 
possibilities: 
• Two wandering trolls 
• A fire giant patrolling with two hell hounds 
• One drow elite warrior and three drow that use 
stealth to remain undetected and avoid confrontation 
LOCATIONS ON THE THIRD LEVEL 
The following locations are identified on map 6.7. 
1. CAVERN 
This cavern is fairly colorful, having many reddish, 
pale yellow, and shining blue-gray rock formations that 
glisten in the light of torches or lanterns. Three ropers 
dwell here and conceal themselves among the natural 
stalagmite formations. They wait until prey approaches 
the center of the area before attacking. 
Treasure. Each roper has one gem (worth 100 gp) in 
its internal digestive organ. 
2. GLOWING CAVE 
This small offshoot of the larger cavern that runs north 
and south is filled with luminous plant growth and con­
tains twelve hungry giant fire beetles. Some will be on 
the ceiling and drop upon any creatures entering their 
lair. These creatures served as a source of gifts for the 
frost giants in the past. They have no treasure. 3. CAVERN END 
The long cavern hooks eastward and terminates. Near 
the dead-end wall is an abandoned subterranean lizard's 
nest that contains several dozen shiny rocks (but none 
of value). 
4. CAVE 
Four hell hounds are on guard here, immediately giving 
voice if they detect any intruders. 
5. CAVERN 
Two fire giants are stationed here as a reserve on 
Snurre's order (acting on instructions from the drow, of 
course). One rests in the northeast end while the other 
keeps watch, patrolling between the spots marked G. 
Each has several rocks nearby for throwing. They have 
a typical giant's bag apiece, and the room also has piles 
of hides for bedding, a hamper or two, and some per-
sonal gear. 
In a crisis situation, this is where King Snurre, Queen 
Frupy, Obmi, and other important fire giants and guests 
will retreat to, along with whatever valuables they 
can salvage. 
6. GREAT VAULTED CAVERN 
In the middle of this place is a permanent illusion of a 
huge red dragon dozing atop a mound of treasure (ap­
pearing like area 7, below). What is actually in that spot 
is a gorgon that obeys drow and has been instructed to 
ignore the presence of such creatures as hell hounds 
and fire giants and trolls. If any other kind of creature 
speaks to it from a distance in Common or Draconic, it 
has been instructed to stand quietly but then to breathe 
upon intruders as soon as they are within range. The 
illusion disappears once the gorgon attacks. 
7. TREASURE TROVE CAVE 
This room is actually an extradimensional space, ten 
times larger than shown on the map. Anyone entering 
will notice first the enormous pile of treasure that fills 
the central part of the area and second the adult red 
dragon sleeping upon it. 
Brazzemal is the dragon's name. If the boulder across 
the entrance is moved, requiring the strength of a fire 
giant, he will certainly awaken. He will not immediately 
reveal that he is aware of intruders, preferring to wait 
until they are at the edge of his breath weapon's range 
before addressing them. 
Brazzemal is persuasive and deceitful, and his real 
desire will be to slay and devour the party and take their 
treasures to add to his already considerable hoard. Few 
adventurers ever face a dragon of his size in battle and 
live to tell about it; make sure that players and char­
acters are well aware that they face a truly terrifying 
foe. Characters who are suitably flattering and ransom 
themselves by handing over the bulk of their wealth and 
magic items may be allowed to withdraw. 
If the dragon is cornered and in desperate straits, he 
will swear to anything in order to save his life, but his 
information is not to be trusted (although he will word 
things in such a way as to avoid uttering any magically 
detectable lie). 
CHAPTER 6 I AGAINST THE GIANTS 207 

--- PAGE 209 ---

208 Treasure. Brazzemal's hoard is an enormous heap, 
most of its volume consisting of loose coins. All the best 
treasures are buried, and a thorough search through the 
pile will take a very long time. It contains: 
• 69,830 cp 
, 34,600 sp 
, 1,870 ep 
, 9,240 gp 
200 pp in a malachite box that is itself worth 100 gp 
• Twenty-three loose gems worth 10 gp each 
• Five gems worth 100 gp each in a gold-chased 
silver egg (the two halves unscrew) that is itself 
worth 100 gp 
, Twelve pieces of assorted jewelry worth 100 gp each 
Five jeweled weapons, human-sized, worth 
200 gp each 
Two silver mirrors worth 50 gp each) 
A ten-piece gold service worth 150 gp per piece 
Ten ivory statues with inlays of gems and precious 
metals worth 200 gp each 
, Four jade carvings and figurines worth 500 gp each 
inside a small chest 
, An idol carved of bloodstone worth 200 gp 
, Seven spell scrolls of wizard spells (DM's choice) in a 
crystal casket worth 500 gp 
• A dragon slayer (DM's choice of sword type) in a jew­
eled scabbard worth 500 gp 
, A brazier of commanding fire elementals 
Four potions of resistance (fire) in a coffer 
Eight jars of rare unguents and perfumes worth 
100 gp each 
A suit of +2 armor, sized for a human (DM's choice of 
armor type) 
In addition, Brazzemal has six hundred sixty-six gems 
(worth 1 gp each) pressed into his stomach to protect 
it. Destructive magical attacks against the dragon will 
certainly destroy from 60 percent to 90 percent of 
these gems as well as wreaking havoc with the hoard 
as a whole. 
8. CAVE 
This is a drow guardroom, currently housing three 
drow elite warriors and six drow. All are clothed in 
black capes, shod with soft boots of black hide, and wear 
hoods over their helmets. Two sentries are on duty at all 
times near the entrance. The room holds only bedrolls 
and some miscellaneous gear. 
Treasure. Each elite warrior carries 40 pp, and each 
other drow carries 5 pp. 
9. WIDE PASSAGE 
Twelve piercers make their home in a cul de sac, where 
they patiently await unwary prey. The floor of the place 
is strewn with shattered skulls and bones. 
Treasure. Amid the gleaming white remains lies a 
gold necklace set with five gems (worth 250 gp in total). 
10. SINGING CHAMBER 
This small place has excellent acoustics, and the drops 
of water falling into the pool along the southern portion 
of the wall make a faint, pleasant musical sound that 
can be heard for 120 feet in silence (or from 60 feet 
CHAPTER 6 I AGAINST THE GIANTS away in normal conditions). The pool's edge is lined by a 
hu e patch of gray ooze, and another lies along a ledge 
11 feet high in the southeast of the place. 
StinkingCAVERNS (AREAS 11-13) 
The large spaces along the southern side of this level 
are inhabited by troll servants of King Snurre. The stink 
that comes from these creatures, their nests, and the 
offal and remnants of rotted meat they leave about is no­
ticeable from as far away as the head of the corridor that 
leads southwest from near area 9. 
These caverns are very dangerous. If the trolls hear 
suspicious noises, or if any of them are assaulted, they 
split up to use the multiple passages in these areas to 
surprise and surround their attackers, leaping out of the 
darkness to tear them to shreds. An assault from nine 
trolls is nothing to sneeze at, even for a high-level party. 
Treasure. Each troll's nest holds about 1,000 gp 
worth of mixed coins. The nest of the large troll in area 
1 3alsocontains fifteengemsworth100 gp eachanda
jeweled mace worth 500 gp. 
11. TroJJ Annex. Three trolls lounge herein, each with 
the typical messy mound of sticks and bones and other 
noisome things. 
12. TroJJ Central. Two trolls. This room, and its in­
habitants, are much the same as those in area 11. 
13. TroJJ Heaven. Four trolls, including a dominant 
one that is particularly large (120 hit points), reside 
here. Conditions are similar to those in areas 11 and 12, 
except even more noisome. 
14. NARROW CAVERN 
The corridor leading north from the troll dens is striated 
with layers of blue and green and greenish-blue depos­
its and streaks. Patches of green slime (see "Dungeon 
Hazards" in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide) 
grow on the roof of the passage and in the pool of water 
at its end. The slime on the ceiling covers an area about 
40 feet wide just south of the pool. The pool holds thir­
ty-six agates (worth 10 gp each), which sparkle in the 
presence of any light-source. Any creature that reaches 
in to get these stones is 50 percent likely to blunder 
into the slime in the pool, which blends in with the 
greenish rock. 
15. GRAY CAVERN 
This dark-walled place is the drow strong point, and a 
drow watches each of the six routes that meet at this 
cavern. Four more drow are stationed in the chamber 
itself, for a total of ten. 
In addition, the eastern alcove serves as a field head­
quarters for two drow elite warriors (the female is in 
command) and a drow mage. Near this alcove, a nar­
row passage leads east and then south, ending at a set 
of rough-hewn stairs that ascend to the second level, 
emerging near area 8 on map 6.6. 
Treasure. The warriors and the mage carry 40 pp 
apiece, and each drow has 5 pp. 
16. SMALL CAVERN 
The arrows to the north of the entry passage on the map 
mark the location of a trap. A character must succeed 
on a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check to spot a trip-

--- PAGE 210 ---

e wire. 
the act triggers a torrent of small iron p e e: each 1 4 
inch in diameter , that pour out of hidden containe on 
the eastern wall. These little spheres coat e floorin 
the final 40 feet of the passageway and the firs20feet 
of the cavern itself. 
If they fall, the iron balls make a loud noi e. and any 
creature moving across the affected area mu t succeed 
on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A crea­
ture that moves through the area at half speed doesn't
need to make the saving throw. 
There are nine female drow in the place. Five are 
normal drow, and three others are drow elite warriors . 
These eight guards protect Nedylene , a drow priestess 
ofLolth who is opposed to anything Eclavdra attempts. 
She is here to check up on her rival, and she will be 
suspicious of any creature entering her current abode. 
On the other hand, she will not be averse to seeing her 
rival's plans go wrong, so negotiation is a possibility. 
Nedylene wields a +2 whip and carries a staff of 
swarming insects in addition to her other gear. 
17. JEWELED CAVERN 
If light strikes the walls of this cavern, mineral deposits 
make the place glitter and sparkle as if it were sown 
with jewels. This breathtakingly beautiful place is the 
current lair of two mind flayers who have decided to 
see what is going on with their friendly enemies, the 
drow. They plan to observe events, and the dark elves 
ignore them. 
Treasure. Each mind flayer carries 250 gp (bribe 
money), and they have a tome of clear thought in a black 
metal box that can be opened only by a creature that has 
Intelligence 18 or higher. 
18. SMALL CAVERN 
The cave at the end of the passage to the northeast is 
another drow guardroom, with occupants and contents 
identical to area 8: three drow elite warriors and 
six drow, two of which are on duty at all times near 
the entrance. 
Treasure. Each elite warrior carries 40 pp, and each 
other drow carries 5 pp. 
19. SALAMANDER CENTRAL 
The huge cavern in the northwest corner of this level is 
lit up in reddish light from the bubbling , steaming river 
of molten lava that flows through the place. The cavern 
stinks of sulfur and heated rock, and the temperature 
here is very hot, although a strong draft cools it some­
what. The roof is no Jess than 60 feet high. 
A rope bridge is suspended about 15 feet above the 
lava river, offering safe access to the northern chamber 
(area 20). The ropes have been specially treated to keep 
them from bursting into flame. A creature that comes 
within 10 feet of the lava for the first time on a turn, or 
starts its turn within 10 feet of the Java, takes 11 (2d10) 
fire damage. A creature that enters or touches the lava 
for the first time on a turn, or starts its turn in the lava, 
takes 33 (6d10) fire damage. 
Amid this vaporous inferno in the area to the south­
east are two salamanders enjoying a change of clime. The flames and smoke render the area lightly obscured. 
The salamanders are totally indifferent with respect 
to whom they attack, although they know and re-
spect the drow. 
20. COUNCIL CHAMBER AND DROW HQ 
The secluded section of the cavern to the north serves 
as the meeting place and council chamber for Eclavdra 
and her minions. If things have gone badly for the drow, 
and Eclavdra has escaped, she will be here with any sur­
viving followers. 
A constant watch is kept on the east entry to the cav­
ern-if intruders come, the dark elves will know of it. If 
threatened by powerful characters, the drow will cut the 
rope bridge, then flee to safety back along the passage to 
the north-northwest (at the location marked A), descend­
ing deep into the Underdark. 
Currently in this place (at the least) are six drow and 
four drow elite warriors, one of which is a female com­
mander who has 110 hit points. The commander has 
a +2 shortsword, a +l hand crossbow, and three magic 
bolts, as follows: 
• A bolt of holding, which casts hold person on a target 
hit with the bolt, as well as up to two other targets 
within 30 feet of that target 
A bolt of blinding, which casts blindness/deafness to 
blind on a target hit with the bolt, as well as up to two 
other targets within 30 feet of that target 
• A bolt of vapors, which casts stinking cloud centered 
on the point it hits 
Each of these effects has a spell save DC of 15 and a du­
ration of 1 minute. 
Treasure. In addition to bedding and a small amount 
of personal gear, a chest holding 200 pp and ten gems 
worth 100 gp each is hidden behind a rock formation in 
the far northeastern corner of the place. (Anyone who 
looks there will find the chest.) 
The commander has a small coffer that contains two 
potions of speed and two potions of superior healing. 
These will be used by the drow if necessary (and if she 
is able to dispense them). 
PURSUING THE DROW 
A pair of hoists-derrick-like machines with straps 
strong enough to hold cargo of any sort (even giants!)­
are tucked into nooks on either side of the river of lava. 
If any of the dark elves escape and the characters want 
to follow them, they can use these hoists to transport 
their possessions over the lava. It will take several 
hours to set the devices into working position, but 
thereafter characters will be able to move supplies and 
pack animals across the river and begin their pursuit 
of the drow. 
If the characters choose not to chase the dark elves, 
assume that the drow collapse the tunnel behind them, 
sealing off the Underdark and ending the threat of coor­
dinated giant attacks thereafter. In any case, surviving 
characters are to be congratulated on the success of 
their mission. Ti>

To B OF HORRORS 
N THE FAR REACHES OF THE WORLD. UnDERA
lost and lonely hill, lies the sini ter Tomb of Hor­
rors. This labyrinthine crypt is filled with terri­
ble traps, strange and ferocious mon ters. rich 
and magical treasures, and somewhere within 
rests the demilich. 
The legend of the tomb is an old story with 
many parts, some of which may be lost or ob­
scured. Characters attempting to glean special informa­
tion by consulting sages or through legend lore spells 
may still have difficulty obtaining as much background 
as they desire, for the scraps of information thus gained 
are often minimal and mystical. 
The essentials of the legend can be furnished to the 
players from the following section. 
LEGEND OF THE TOMB 
Somewhere under a lost and lonely hill of grim and fore­
boding aspect lies a labyrinthine crypt. It is filled with 
terrible traps and not a few strange and ferocious mon­
sters to slay the unwary. It is filled with rich treasures 
both precious and magical, but in addition to the afore­
mentioned guardians, there is said to be a demilich who 
still wards his final haunt. Be warned that tales have it 
that this being, called Acererak, possesses powers that 
make him nearly undefeatable! 
All accounts conclude that it is quite unlikely any ex­
plorers will ever find the chamber where the demilich 
lingers, for the passages and rooms of the tomb are 
fraught with traps, poison gases, and magical protec­
tions. Furthermore, the demilich has so well hidden his 
lair that even those who avoid the pitfalls will not be 
likely to locate their true goal. Only large and well-pre­
pared parties of the bravest and strongest should even 
consider the attempt, and if such a group does locate 
the tomb, they must be prepared to fail. Any expedition 
must have magical protections and weapons, and must 
be equipped with every sort of device possible to en­
sure survival. 
THE TRUTH BEHIND THE LEGEND 
Ages ago, a human wizard/cleric of surpassing evil took 
the steps necessary to preserve his life force beyond 
the centuries he had already Jived, and this creature 
became the Jich known as Acererak. Over the scores of 
years which followed, the Jich dwelled with hordes of 
ghastly servants in the gloomy stone halls of the very hill 
where the tomb is. 
Eventually even the undead life force of Acererak be­
gan to wane, so for the next eight decades, the lich's ser­
vants labored to create the Tomb of Horrors. Then Acer­
erak destroyed all his slaves and servitors, magically hid 
the entrance to his halls, and went to reside in his final 
haunt, while his soul roamed strange planes unknown to even the wisest of sages. If the characters gain access 
to the innermost part of the tomb where the lich's crypt 
lies, their actions along the way will have caused his 
soul to be called back to the Material Plane and alerted 
Acererak, now a demilich, that interlopers have invaded 
his resting place. 
RUNNING THE ADVENTURE 
As clever players will gather from the information in the 
"Legend of the Tomb," this dungeon has more tricks and 
traps than it has monsters to fight. This is a thinking 
person's adventure, and if your group is a hack-and-slay 
gathering, they will be unhappy! Only high-level charac­
ters stand a chance of surviving, but every player who 
braves the tomb will have the experience of a lifetime. 
Negotiation of the tomb will require quite a long time, 
so be prepared to spend several sessions with this 
material. When the game ends for the day, assume the 
expedition is spending the intervening time resting and 
recovering until play again commences. Since there 
are no monsters to be randomly encountered within the 
tomb, the party might be able to encamp close to the 
entrance without fear of being disturbed, but if you do so 
opt, do not inform the players of this. 
As characters enter the various areas, read aloud ap­
propriate sections of text, but never give any additional 
PLACINC THE ADVENTURE 
In the original Tomb of Horrors, Gary Gygax suggested six 
possible, far-flung locations for the adventure in the Grey­
hawk setting-proof in itself that the tomb is liable to turn 
up just about anywhere. Those possibilities are as follows: 
, Inside the highest hill on the Plains ofluz 
, On an island (unmapped) in the Nyr Dyv 
, In the Bright Desert 
, At the western border of the Duchy of Geoff 
, Somewhere in the Vast Swamp south ofSunndi 
, On an island beyond the realm of the Sea Barons 
Other settings offer choices that are just as varied. 
Dragon/once. The tomb on Krynn might be in the foot­
hills near the Eastwall Mountains, in the Cursed Lands of 
Newsea, or in the Shadowglades of Krynn, where a rene­
gade wizard who served Takhisis was said to dwell. 
Eberron. Appropriate sites for the tomb in Eberron in­
clude the Ashen Spires of Karrnath, or among the tors in 
the Vile Marsh between Droaam and the Shadow Marches. 
among Shargon's Teeth. Eberron's Boneyard could hide 
the tomb and thus speak to Acererak's enmity for Eber­
ron's dragons. 
Forgotten Realms. The tomb could be in the Serpent 
Hills or the Trielta Hills on Faerun. It could be in the 
High Moor or amid the isles that make up the Korinn 
Archipelago in the Moonshaes. It might be somewhere 
in the Anauroch desert, perhaps tying Acererak to an­
cient Netheril.

212 information that player characters would have no way 
of knowing, and avoid facial expressions or voice tones 
that might either give helpful hints or mislead players. 
The real enjoyment of this adventure is in managing to 
cope, and those players who do so with even moderate 
success will appreciate your refereeing properly and al­
lowing them to "live or die" on their own. 
The starting information given here simply assumes 
that the expedition has arrived at the site of the Tomb of 
Horrors. After relating the salient features of the "Leg­
end of the Tomb," you may fill in whatever other back­
ground is needed to get the characters to the site. 
ADVENTURE START 
The characters have arrived at the site of the demilich's 
last haunt. Before them is a low, flat topped hill, about 
200 yards wide, 300 yards long, and 60 feet high. Only 
ugly weeds, thorns, and briars grow upon the steep 
sides and bald top of the mound. There are black rocks 
upon the top of the hill, and if these are viewed from a 
height of about 200 feet or so above the mound, it will be 
seen that the whole is shaped like a human skull, with 
piles of rock appearing as eyeholes, a nose hole, and the 
jagged teeth of a grinning death's head. 
A thorough inspection and search of the entire area 
reveals only that the north side of the hill has a crum­
bling cliff of sand and gravel about 20 feet high in the 
middle of the whole. (This cliff face is represented by the 
northern edge of map 7.1.) A low stone ledge overhangs 
this eroded area, and shrubs and bushes obscure it from 
observation at a distance. 
It takes 10 minutes for characters to search each 
10-foot-wide space along the cliff face. This examination 
must be done from a distance, using a long spear or a 
10-foot pole to poke into the sand and gravel, looking for 
an opening. Any prodding into the cliff face must be suf-
DEMONIC ATTENTION 
Characters who become astral or ethereal in the tomb 
might attract a demon. Roll a d20 whenever this occurs. 
On a roll of l to 16, no demon appears. Otherwise the fol­
lowing demons could appear: 17, a vrock; 18, a hezrou; 19, 
a glabrezu; or 20, a nalfeshnee. 
ABOUT THE 0RICINAL ficiently high off the ground in order to collapse enough 
material to expose a portion of a tunnel entrance. Once 
an entrance is exposed, it takes about 1 hour for charac­
ters to thoroughly clear the passage that lies beyond, but 
a crawl space can be opened in 10 minutes. 
Probing of the gravel and sand face can begin wher­
ever the characters choose-east side, west side, mid­
dle, several locations at once or merely a single one 
at a time. Leave this strictly to the players to decide. 
The best manner to handle it is to ask where they will 
search, once they have determined that they will in­
vestigate the area and they have stated how it will be 
done and with what. Remember that probing low to the 
ground, or probing with short implements (daggers , 
swords, and the like) will not reveal anything. 
As soon as any entrance is cleared and entered, go to 
the appropriate location on map 7.1: either area 1, area 
2, or area 3. 
LOCATIONS IN THE TOMB 
The following locations are identified on map 7.1. 
1. FALSE ENTRANCE TUNNEL 
If the characters clear the passage on the west side of 
the cliff face, read: 
The corridor before you is made of plain stone, roughly 
worked, and it is dark and full of cobwebs. The ceiling 
overhead is obscured by hanging strands of webbing. 
Casual observation will not reveal that the ceiling, 
20 feet overhead , is composed of badly fitting stones. 
The cobwebs must be burned away for someone to be 
able to inspect the tunnel ceiling. Anyone who does so 
and succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) 
check realizes that the ceiling is unstable and in danger 
of collapse. 
Daylight is sufficient to reveal a pair of oaken doors 
at the end of the passageway . The doors open outward 
by means of great iron ring pulls. When either door is 
opened, it is revealed to be a false door, and the trap is 
triggered . 
Tomb of Horrors was born in Gary 
Gygax's home campaign and in­
troduced to the world at the first 
Origins game convention in 1975. 
Since its original publication in 
1978, Tomb of Horrors has risen In the words of its creator, "This 
is a thinking person's adventure ." 
to legendary status among D&D 
players and is generally regarded 
as one of the greatest adventures 
of all time. 
CHAPTER 7 I TOMB OF HORRORS It was designed not for player char­
acters of a certain level-though 
high-level adventurers are certainly 
necessary -but for players who 
enjoy a mental challenge and DMs 
who want to put their own spin on 
this truly unique dungeon. 

--- PAGE 214 ---

214Ceiling Trap. If the ceiling is prodded with any force, 
or if the doors are opened, the ceiling of the tunnel col­
lapses. Creatures under the collapse must make a DC 
15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 27 (5d10) bludgeon­
ing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage 
on a successful one. The trap mechanism is beyond 
the doors and inside the ceiling, so it can't be disabled 
from outside. 
2. FALSE ENTRANCE TUNNEL 
If the characters clear the passage on the east side of 
the cliff face, read: 
I The corridor before you is made of plain stone, roughly 
worked and mortared, with a 10-foot-high ceiling. 
Daylight will enable adventurers to dimly see what ap­
pear to be two separate doors at the end of the corridor. 
The paving stones on the floor 50 feet south of the 
entrance are unmortared and shift slightly when char­
acters tread upon the surface. A character who inspects 
the floor in this section and succeeds on a DC 15 Wis­
dom (Perception) check notices the change in the floor. 
A character can use thieves' tools to keep the stones 
from shifting by taking 1 minute and succeeding on a 
DC 20 Dexterity check. On a failed check, the shims are 
put in place but they fail when someone moves across 
the stone, and the trap is triggered. 
CHAPTER 7 I TOMB OF HORRORS Sliding Block Trap. If the paving stones shift when 
someone moves across them, a 10-foot-thick block of 
stone emerges from the midpoint of the eastern wall 
and begins to slide into the corridor. Have the players 
roll initiative. On each initiative count, the block slides 
6 inches to the west, until at initiative count 1, it com­
pletely blocks the corridor. The block's movement can 
be stopped by using an iron bar or a similarly sturdy 
normal object, but only if the object is placed on the 
floor where it can be wedged into the space between 
the block and the floor. If the block moves far enough 
to prevent the characters from escaping, they have 
to devise a means to bypass it. It can't be moved or 
forced backward. 
The doors at the end of the passage are false ones. 
3. ENTRANCE TO THE TOMB OF HORRORS 
Even a bit of light entering through a crawl space or 
provided by a torch will reveal that an unusual tunnel 
lies ahead. If the characters clear the passage near the 
center of the cliff face, read: 
Bright, brilliant colors are to be seen everywhere, the 
stones and pigments undimmed by the passage of de­
cades. The floor of the corridor is a colorful mosaic of 
stone, with a distinct, winding path of red tiles about two 
feet wide snaking its way south down the corridor. No 
stonework can be seen on the walls or the ceiling twenty 

--- PAGE 216 ---

feet above, for some sort of cement or plastehasbeen
smoothed over all of these surfaces and the usrated. 
The scenes show fields with kine grazing a c pse1t 
several wolves in the background , workers ofa ious
races and strange human-animal mixtures--pig-human,
ape-human, and dog-human-going about arious tas s. 
Certain of the frescoes show rooms of some building--a
library filled with many books and scrolls, the door of a 
torture chamber, and a wizard's work room. There are 
chairs, windows, boxes, bales, doors, chests, birds, bats, 
spiders, and all manner of things shown on the walls. 
This corridor contains five covered pits (see the sidebar). 
On the west wall adjacent to the northernmost pit is 
where the torture chamber is painted. The wall hiding 
the passage to the west shows a depiction of an iron 
door that evidently confines some sort of horrid creature 
(its taloned and scaled hands grasp the bars of its small 
window). If the plaster and lath beneath this image is 
broken away, a normal, inward-opening door will be 
revealed. If the plaster remains intact, the door can be 
discovered only by magical means. 
Message from Acererak. If the path of red tiles on 
the floor is carefully observed and studied all the way 
from the entrance to where the path forks toward areas 
5 and 6, the individual with such perseverance will be 
rewarded by suddenly understanding that a message is 
contained in barely noticeable runes in the mosaic floor. 
The message reads: 
Acererak congratulates you on your powers of observa­
tion, so make of this whatever you wish, for you will be 
mine in the end no matter what! 
Go back to the tormentor or through the arch, and the 
second great hall you'll discover. 
Shun green if you can, but night's good color is for those 
of great valor. 
If shades of red stand for blood, the wise will not need 
sacrifice aught but a loop of magical metal-you're well 
along your march. 
Two pits along the way will be found to lead to a fortu­
itous fall, so check the wall. 
These keys and those are most important of all, and be­
ware of trembling hands and what will maul. 
If you find the false you find the true, and into the col­
umned hall you'll come,and there the throne that's key 
and keyed. 
The iron men of visage grim do more than meets the 
viewer's eye. 
You've left and left and found my tomb, and now your 
souls will die. 
4. FRESCO OF THE WIZARDLY WORK ROOM 
The most outstanding feature in this location is actu­
ally outstanding! Two jackal-headed human figures are 
painted so as to appear to be holding a real bronze chest 
that protrudes from the wall. COVERED PITS 
Pit traps throughout the tomb, except where otherwise 
noted, are constructed as covered pits. Each one islO 
feet deep and concealed by a counterweighted trapdoor 
that looks like the floor and opens as soon as any person 
steps on it. 
A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Percep· 
tion) check discerns the edges of a pit's lid. In addition, 
someone who prods a pit lid can force the lid to open with 
a successful DC 10 Strength check. The lid can be wedged 
shut with a piton or a similar object. A character must suc­
ceed on a DC 15 Strength check to place the shim prop· 
erly. On a failed check, the shim fails if someone treads 
on the lid. 
Each pit is spiked at the bottom, so someone who falls 
in takes falling damage plus 11 (2dl0) piercing damage 
from the spikes. The spikes are also poisoned, so some­
one injured by them must make a DC 15 Constitution 
saving throw, taking 22 (4dl0) poison damage on a failed 
save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 
Poison Needle Trap. If the chest is examined closely, 
the viewer will note that it is hinged on the bottom so 
as to allow the lid to swing down if a catch on the top 
is pressed. The catch has an easily seen poison needle 
trap-the needle sticks 3 inches out of the wall-and the 
needle can be avoided easily by pressing the catch with 
the pommel of a dagger. Disabling the trap by taking the 
needle out of the mechanism requires the use of thieves' 
tools and a successful DC 10 Dexterity check. 
The needle deals 1 piercing damage and 11 (2d10) 
poison damage if it hits someone . Someone who takes 
this poison damage must succeed on a DC 15 Constitu­
tion saving throw or become poisoned for 1 hour. 
Deep Covered Pit. If the chest is opened, it appears 
to be empty, but a character who actually feels inside the 
chest will find a rod that protrudes vertically from the 
bottom. This lever moves easily, and if it is pulled with 
any force it will open a trapdoor in this square that cov­
ers a 30-foot-deep covered pit (see the sidebar). Some­
one who falls in takes damage from a 30-foot fall as well 
as from the spikes and the poison. 
The trapdoor over this pit is 3 feet thick and can't be 
detected by sounding , and it is technically not a trap, so 
a find traps spell doesn't reveal it. A true seeing spell 
reveals a tiny rectangular gap where the door meets the 
floor. Once the trapdoor falls away, the pit remains open 
thereafter. 
5. THE ARCH OF MIST 
One section of the path shown on the floor leads directly 
into a stone archway. If any character stands within 2 
feet of the entranceway upon the path, read: 
The stone archway before you is filled with a veil of thick 
vapors. The stones on either side of the base and the key­
stone protrude slightly from the stones around them. As 
you move to within touching distance, the left-hand base 
stone begins to glow yellow, the right-hand base stone 
orange, and the keystone seven feet above blue. 
CHAPTER 7 I TOMB OF HORRORS 215 

--- PAGE 217 ---

216Nothing will cause the vapors to clear, nor will any sort 
of magic allow sight into the area, until the glowing 
stones are pressed in the proper sequence: yellow, blue, 
orange. If this is done, the vapors disappear, and the 
path appears to go eastward. 
If the archway is entered when it is clouded, those 
characters doing so will be instantly teleported to area 7. 
If it is passed through after pressing the glowing stones 
in proper sequence , those who step through while 
following the path will be teleported to area 11, and 
those who pass through off the path will be sent back 
to area 3. 
6. THE FACE OF THE GREAT GREEN DEVIL 
The path of red tiles leads south from the fork. If any 
character comes within 2 feet of the southern wall, read: 
On the wall before you is a relief sculpture of a devil 
face formed of mosaic tiles. The face has a huge O of a 
mouth, inside of which the space is dead black. 
Aura. The devil face radiates an aura of transmutation 
magic if detect magic is used on it, and a casting of 
detect evil and good or a paladin's use of Divine Sense 
reveals it as a desecrated place. 
Mouth Trap. The mouth opening is similar to a 
sphere of annihilation, but it is about 3 feet in diame­
ter-plenty of room for those who wish to leap in and be 
completely and forever destroyed. A character who ex­
amines the mouth and succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence 
(Arcana) check identifies the trap for what it is. 
7. THE FORSAKEN PRISON 
This miserable cubicle appears to have absolutely no 
means of egress. Three iron levers, each about one foot 
long, protrude from the south wall of the chamber . 
Even a magical means of detection will not indicate any 
way out of this place. 
Levers. The iron ievers can be moved horizontally 
or vertically, singly or in combination. Only the act of 
moving all three together upward or downward has any 
results. Moving them up opens a small trapdoor in the 
center of the ceiling 10 feet above. Pushing them simul­
taneously down opens the entire floor to a 100-foot-deep 
pit with no exit. The floor returns to a closed position 
in 10 minutes, sealing any victim inside the pit until an­
other creature triggers the floor trap again. 
Crawl Space. The ceiling route is a crawl space some 
3 feet square. At the place it turns east there is a plug in 
the ceiling, which can be detected only with magic or if 
a character has sense enough to check for secret doors. 
A character who succeeds on a DC 20 Wisdom (Percep­
tion) check can find the door. Also, anyone who raps or 
sounds on the ceiling in the door's area hears it is hol­
low, indicating a space beyond. Eventually the small tun­
nel leads to a magical one-way door, which opens in the 
pit side as shown, and players are back to square one. 
CHAPTER 7 I TOMB OF HORRORS 8. GARGOYLE LAIR 
When any door leading to the lair is opened, it frees the 
room·s occupant from temporal stasis. 
What appeared to be a statue an instant ago comes to 
life before your eyes. The creature flaps its wings and 
stares at you. 
Creature. A mutated, four-armed gargoyle attacks 
anyone who enters its lair. This creature uses Multiat­
tack to make three attacks: one with its bite and two 
with its claws. 
Treasure. Around the creature's neck is a collar stud­
ded with ten gleaming gems (blue quartz stones of 100 
gp value each). 
Hidden in a secret compartment of the collar is a slip 
of parchment with the following written on it in magical 
code (requiring comprehend languages to understand): 
"Look low and high for gold, to hear a tale untold. Take 
the archway at the end, and on your way you'll wend." 
Beneath the runes, the initial "A" is inscribed. 
9. COMPLEX OF SECRET DOORS 
If someone opens the door on the east wall of 
area 8, read: 
l The small room beyond the door is empty and appears to 
have no other exits. 
The south wall contains the first in a series of secret 
doors. Each of these portals requires a successful DC 
20 Wisdom (Perception) check to find and must be 
opened by hand using a particular method, as follows: 
A. Pull down and inward (hinged on bottom) 
B. Pivot on central hinge 
C. Pull inward and up at bottom (hinged on top) 
D. Slide up 
E. Pull double panels inward (hinged on sides) 
F. Slide left 
G. Door has seven studs ina row--press all at once and 
door opens, but press 1 and 7 and the door falls in­
ward. A character pressing the studs or near enough 
to do so must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving 
throw or take 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage from the 
falling door. 
Bolts from Above. Each round that characters are in 
any of the rooms inside the complex of secret doors, a 
number of bolts will be fired into the area from hidden 
devices in the walls and ceilings, and there is a 50 per­
cent chance that one character, randomly determined, 
in each such area must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity 
saving throw or take 5 (ldlO) piercing damage. There is 
no way to prevent the bolts from being triggered. 
10. GREAT HALL OF SPHERES 
This area is similar to area 3, for the floor is of inlaid 
tiles and the walls and ceiling are painted with figures 
of animals, strange signs and glyphs (which mean abso-

--- PAGE 218 ---

lutely nothing), and humans and human-like creatures 
posing with spheres of different colors. These globes are 
two-dimensional, of course, and their significance and 
pattern are described below. From north to south, with 
the west wall being the left-hand column, and the east 
the right-hand, the spheres are colored and positioned 
as follows: 
West Wall 
Gold, held high overhead' 
Orange, held waist high 
(False door) 
Purple, at feet 
(False door) 
Bronze, held waist high 
Gray, held at shoulder

Anillusion covering a crawlway to area 11 
2This door can be opened by a knock spell or destroyed with 
disintegrate 
3An illusion covering a crawlway to area 14 
4An illusion covering a crawlway to area 13 
The false doors and secret doors can be found with 
successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) checks. If 
anyone makes physical contact with an illusion in this 
area, its nature becomes apparent. Also, a character 
who examines an illusory image without touching it 
can make a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. 
On a successful check, the illusion becomes faint to the 
character, who can then easily see the crawlway beyond 
the illusion. 
Magic Archway. On the south wall is a stone arch­
way similar in appearance to area 5, also filled with 
cloudy vapors that block vision or detection of what lies 
beyond. When a character moves to within 3 feet of the 
arch, read: 
As you come close, three stones in the archway in front 
of you begin to glow. The left-hand base stone shines 
with an olive hue; the one on the right glows citron, and 
the keystone seven feet overhead gives off russet light. 
No matter how the stones are manipulated, the archway 
remains clouded and veiled with a haze which nothing 
can enable the onlookers to see through. All living 
matter which goes through the arch will be teleported 
to area 3, while nonliving matter is teleported simulta­
neously to area 33-meaning that characters stepping 
through will appear at the start totally nude, while 
everything else with them will go to the crypt of the de­
milich. (Cruel, but most entertaining for the DM.) 11. THE THREE-ARMED STATUE 
This small room holds what appears to be a statue of a 
gargoyle, eight feet tall, with four arms. One of the arms 
is broken off and lies on the floor in front of the statue. 
No amount of fooling around with the broken arm will 
enable it to be replaced, and the statue will do nothing at 
all meanwhile. 
Ten Gems for One. A close look at the open and 
outstretched hands of the statue will determine that a 
large gem (a 100 gp blue quartz fits perfectly) will fit in a 
carved depression in each of the three remaining hands, 
while the broken one has no such concavity. If three 
large gems of any sort are placed within the hands, the 
stony digits will close and crush them to powder, dump 
the remains on the floor, and return to their normal 
positions. 
If this process is repeated until ten gems (or more) are 
crushed, a magic mouth spell is triggered and speaks 
the following words: "Your sacrifice was not in vain. 
Look to the fourth to find your gain." 
As these words are uttered, an invisible gem of seeing 
will come into being in the palm of the broken-off arm. 
The gem must be found, and the character so doing 
will need to wipe it free of a magical substance before 
it can be seen or used. Note that if the arm is carelessly 
moved, the gem will fall out and roll away. See invisibil­
ity or any other sort of searching except by careful feel­
ing will be useless. Describe the gem, once it is wiped 
CHAPTER 7 I TOMB OF HORRORS

--- PAGE 219 ---

218 clean and visible, as an oval diamond, with two flat and 
polished sides, very clear, and about 1 inch in diameter 
by a quarter-inch thick. It will operate only twelve times, 
then shatter. 
12. TRAPPED FALSE DOORS 
In four locations in the tomb, there are false doors 
which screen a spear trap. When one of these doors is 
opened, a spear will shoot out, and the door opener or 
someone standing nearby is subject to be struck. De­
termine at random, if need be, which character is the 
target. The trap has a range of 60 feet, has a +11 bonus 
to hit, and deals 9 (2d8) piercing damage. If the door is 
closed and reopened, another spear will fire. The mech­
anism can be jammed by a character who uses thieves' 
tools and succeeds on a DC 20 Dexterity check. 
13. CHAMBER OF THREE CHESTS 
When the party enters the illusory crawlway hidden by 
the red sphere, they will come to an apparent dead end, 
but a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check re­
veals the presence of a secret door. 
The character who opens the door will fall to the floor 
10 feet below due to a tilting stone at the mouth of the 
crawlway, taking falling damage (a mere annoyance, but 
it erodes the strength of the party). 
Three large chests are affixed firmly to the floor; the 
western one is gold (plate covering iron), the center one 
is silver (plate over iron), and the eastern one is of oak 
bound with thick bronze bands. Each is about 4 feet 
long, 2 feet wide, and 3 feet high. 
Gold. Opening the gold chest releases a swarm of 
poisonous snakes that slither out and attack next 
round. They continue biting until all are killed. 
Silver. Inside the silver chest is a clear crystal box 
(worth 1,000 gp) that holds a ring of protection. Some­
one who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) 
check while examining the box and the chest notices 
the box is set into the chest bottom. When this box is 
lifted from the supposed bottom of the chest, eight darts 
will fire upward, and the one or two characters leaning 
over the chest so as to be in the line of fire will take ld4 
attacks each if they are exposed to the path of these 
missiles. The darts have a range of 60 feet, a +11 bonus 
to hit, and deal 3 (ld6) damage on a hit. The trap mecha­
nism is under the crystal box and can't be disabled with­
out first removing the box. 
Oak. When the lid of the oak chest is opened, an ani­
mated giant skeleton (see appendix B) will be instantly 
teleported into the room, and it strikes with surprise. 
14. CHAPEL OF EVIL 
After passing through the illusory black sphere the 
party will have crawled along the small tunnel until 
reaching the end, only to find it is solid stone. It requires 
a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check to find 
the secret door at the end of the passage-no form of 
magic will detect it, save for a gem of seeing. If the char­
acters open the door and enter the room, read: 
CHAPTER 7 I TOMB OF HORRORS You see what is obviously some form of temple area. 
There are scenes of normal life painted on the walls, but 
the people have rotting flesh, skeletal hands, worms 
eating them, and so forth. Yet there are also depicted 
various religious symbols of good alignment. There is 
a mosaic path leading between four rows of wooden 
pews that face the worship area. In front of the pews, a 
wooden railing divides the room. South of it is an altar in 
front of a tiered dais, on which sits a wooden chair. 
If the characters move farther into the room so they can 
see the features in the south end, continue: 
The chair is nicely carved and padded but seems 
unremarkable. On either side of the dais are large, 
free-standing large brass candelabras each holding five 
white candles. In each corner on the southern wall is a 
large white pottery urn stoppered with a brass and wood 
plug. Sprawled on the floor near the west wall is human 
skeleton in black chain mail that is badly rusted and dam­
aged. The skeleton's outstretched arm points to a stone 
archway set in the wall. The opening is filled with opaque, 
bright orange vapors. 
Aura. A casting of detect evil and good or a paladin's 
use of Divine Sense identifies the chapel as a conse­
crated place. (What a puzzle! Could the demilich actu­
ally have been of good alignment?) 
Pews. Simple examination indicates that all of the 
benches have hinged seats. If a character examines ei­
ther of the pews in the front row before opening the lid, 
a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals 
that the hinges on this pew are larger than the ones on 
the pews in the other rows. 
Gas Trap. The hinges on the front pews are larger 
and stronger because they include rods that are con­
nected to valves inside the pew. If the seat on either of 
the front pews is lifted up, a cloud of poison gas fills the 
whole room in 2 rounds. A character caught in the gas 
must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or 
become poisoned for 48 hours. 
If the hinges are noticed and then disassembled, 
requiring 1 minute and a successful DC 15 Dexterity 
check using thieves' tools for each hinge, the trap can't 
trigger. A failed check results in no progress at the task, 
but if the check fails by 5 or more, the trap goes off ex­
plosively, blowing the lid open. 
Treasure. The back pair of pews have 4,000 sp each 
hidden therein, the next pair have 3,000 ep each, and 
the pair closest to the trapped pews have 2,000 gp each. 
Altar. The centerpiece of the chapel is a block of 
strange material that glows with an inner light of opales­
cent blue. (If the altar is specifically targeted by a detect 
evil and good spell, it registers very faintly as a dese­
crated object.) If the altar is touched by living matter, a 
lightning bolt spell (save DC 15) will streak down the 

--- PAGE 220 ---

center aisle. After this bolt comes forth, the altar turns 
a fiery blue-red, and if it thereafter is touched by any ob­
ject it will explode as a fireball spell (save DC 1 5. 
Archway. Just as in other locations around the tomb, 
the mists that obscure the archway can't be penetrated 
with any sort of vision or magic. (If a character moves 
close to the archway and asks about it, explain that none 
of the stones of the arch glow.) The skeleton. of course, 
misleads the party, for any character passing through 
the portal will enter a 10-foot-by-10-foot room where 
their sex and alignment are reversed by a powerful 
magic. Exiting the room and reentering the archway 
will restore original alignment, but also deals 3 (ld6) 
psychic damage. Going back a third time will reverse 
sex again, but the individual will be teleported in the 
manner of the archway in area 10. Only a wish spell will 
restore both alignment and sex. If alignment is restored 
by entering the orange portal, a remove curse or greater 
restoration spell will then restore original sex. 
Wall Slot. A character who inspects the eastern wall 
directly opposite the archway and succeeds on a DC 10 
Wisdom (Perception) check finds a small slot with the 
letter O faintly traced above it. This is the location of a 
moving stone block described below. The block can't be 
magically detected, nor will it open by physical or magi­
cal means other than the method given in area 15. 
15. STONE GATE 
As shown on the map, the stone that forms part of the 
eastern wall of the chapel is 2 feet wide, 4 feet high, and 
10 feet thick in a wedge shape. It is impregnated with 
strong antimagic that prevents its detection or removal 
or its change to another form or substance. The wall 
slot (see above) is of sufficient size to accept a coin or a 
disc-shaped gem. It is also just right for the insertion of 
a magic ring of any sort. Only such an item will trigger 
the mechanism, which causes the block to sink slowly 
into the floor so as to allow entry into the passage be­
yond. The object deposited into the slot is forever lost, as 
the sinking stone crushes all to pieces. The gate opens 
easily from the other (east) side, and no special item is 
required to trigger its opening from that side. 
Doors and Pits. Beyond the gate stone, the corridor 
widens to 10 feet and turns southward where steps lead 
down steeply to a corridor that goes west. Each of the 
three doors in the corridor opens easily if any pushing 
force is applied to it, and a creature that does so stum­
bles into the pit on the other side unless it succeeds on 
a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. If a door isn't violently 
pushed against, it can be opened safely by pulling it 
inward, and the party will have standard chances of fall­
ing in when the characters leading the way step on the 
pit cover. 
By the time the westernmost door and pit have been 
reached, the characters will certainly expect the pit, and 
will be likely to bypass and ignore it. This carelessness 
would prevent them from examining the pit from within. 
On the south wall of the pit is a wooden door painted 
to look like stone, which is easily discovered by anyone 
who looks at this wall while inside the pit or who makes 
a tactile investigation of the wall from outside the pit. Crawl Space. Beyond the painted door is a narrow 
passage that emerges at the top of a short flight of stairs 
leading down. 
16. LOCKED OAKEN DOOR 
The thick wooden door ahead of you is heavily bound 
with iron bands, and there are several locks keep-
ing it shut. 
Aura. The door is found to radiate an aura of abjura­
tion magic if a detect magic spell is cast upon it. 
Sounds from Beyond. A character who listens with 
an ear to the door will hear far-off music and happy sing­
ing, obviously coming from the other side of the door. 
No amount of forcing or spells will open the door. The 
only way to continue northward is to use a disintegrate 
spell on the door or physically destroy it (it has 100 
hit points). 
If the characters destroy the door, read: 
As the door falls away, you can hear sounds of confusion 
and distress coming from the north. A faint glow, like 
that of a small flame, shines in the distance. The walls of 
the passage ahead of you are of smooth white alabaster, 
and the floor is highly polished, smoke-gray marble. 
CHAPTER 7 I TOMB OF HORRORS 
219 

--- PAGE 221 ---

220 The destruction of the door triggered a minor illusion 
spell that produced the noises of distress, which are de­
signed to lure the characters onward. 
The tunnel floor is a counterweighted beam. Its over­
balancing point is the third square north of the door. 
When one or more characters move there, the floor be­
yond the door will begin to tilt downward, with the north 
end slowly sinking. If this occurs, quickly state how the 
floor is beginning to slant, and have the characters roll 
initiative. On initiative count 10, all characters north of 
the door fall prone and slide 10 feet to the north. 
A character can attempt to scramble back up the ramp 
to the south by making a successful DC 10 Strength 
(Athletics) check, or two successful checks if using the 
Dash action. Those who succeed still slide 10 feet north 
on initiative count 10 in each round, but they can also 
climb upward according to the normal rules for doing 
so. A character whose check fails by 5 or more slides an 
extra 5 feet to the north. Those who slide to the fourth 
square north of the door take 3 (ld6) fire damage, then 
11 (2d10) fire damage in the fifth square. Characters 
who slide farther than that are plunged into a pit of mol­
ten lava which will absolutely snuff them out. 
17. MAGICAL SECRET DOOR 
This entrance to the remainder of the tomb is on the 
wall adjoining the stairway that leads down. It can be 
found by mundane means, requiring a successful DC 
20 Wisdom (Perception) check, but nothing will enable 
it to be opened until either the area is viewed through 
a gem of seeing, a true seeing spell is cast, or a detect 
magic spell is used to determine the door's magic aura 
(abjuration). 
After the magic of the door is identified, a dispel magic 
or remove curse spell is needed to remove the guard 
that prevents the door from being opened. Once this 
is accomplished, the secret door can be opened easily 
from either side. 
18. CORRIDOR PROTECTED BY FEAR GAS 
If the characters travel south from the secret door, they 
reach a landing at the top of a stairway. 
I Stairs descend to the west. The corridor that extends 
past the bottom of the steps is slightly cloudy. 
The corridor is filled with fear gas. Unless characters 
announce they are holding their breath before enter­
ing its 40-foot length, they will breathe in the gas. A 
creature exposed to the gas must succeed on a DC 
15 Constitution saving throw or become frightened 
for 1 minute. 
A creature frightened in this way must take the Dash 
action on each of its turns to retrace its steps, moving 
away from this area of the tomb by the safest route pos­
sible. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the 
end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a 
successful save. Once the effect ends, the creature is im­
mune to the gas for 1 hour. 
Beyond the first 10 feet, the gas becomes thicker, and 
it irritates the eyes. The area is lightly obscured, so it 
CHAPTER 7 I TOMB OF HORRORS requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check 
to notice the south door that leads into area 18A. Once 
that door is opened, the gas dissipates. 
18A. FALSE CRYPT 
Beyond the door, a stairway leads down. The way is 
blocked by thick webbing that fills the area from steps 
to ceiling. 
The steps down to the chamber at the end are filled with 
webs (as the spell) which can only be removed by mag­
ical fire (a burning hands spell, a flame tongue sword, 
or the like). Any character trying to break through them 
will become hopelessly entangled and can't get loose un­
less the webs are burned away or the character is freed 
by a wish spell. 
If the characters clear away the webs and descend to 
the foot of the stairway, read: 
Lying on the floor at the bottom of the stairs is an iron 
mace inlaid with silver. South of this location is a mod­
est-sized room. What you can see of it is filled with rot­
ting and decayed furnishings. 
The mace will begin to glow with a bright golden light 
when it is picked up by any character. (Whenever this 
weapon is swung at the occupant of this chamber, it 
will hit.) 
Characters who enter the room will see a solid gold 
couch along the back wall. A skeletal figure that resem­
bles a lich, wearing a crown on its head, slowly rises 
from the couch (and throws up its hands in apparent 
fear if the mace is being carried). A booming voice 
seeming to emanate from the whole of the chamber will 
demand: "Who dares to disturb the rest of Acererak? It 
is your death which you have found!" 
Creature. The false crypt is the home of a false lich 
that is actually a magically prepared greater zombie 
(see appendix B). Between strikes the creature will ges­
ture with its hands as if readying a spell. If it is struck by 
the golden mace it will make a roaring bellow (produced 
by a magic mouth spell), and the weapon will obviously 
stagger it (roll dice and shake your head ruefully) every 
time the mace is used. The third time it is struck by the 
glowing mace, the false lich will instantly wither and 
disappear in a puff of dust, and the mace will shatter. 
If the characters investigate the room's contents, they 
can see a jade coffer, the dead monster's fallen crown, 
and a fine leather bag (its condition is a give-away-it 
isn't rotten) all within easy reach. The furnishings and 
decorations are of no value. 
Collapse. At the moment when the false lich disap­
pears, the room will start to shake and stones will begin 
to come down from the ceiling. Obviously the place is 
beginning to collapse, but take your time detailing the 
increasing rumblings, tremors, grinding noises, falling 
hunks of ceiling, and so forth to the players. 

--- PAGE 222 ---

Now begin counting slowly to 10, and it is odds on 
that there will be a stampede up the stairs to get away! 
A programmed illusion spell affecting the entire false 
crypt will produce the full effects of a cave-in. complete 
with tactile components. Actual dust will billow up the 
stairs, while bits of stone begin to fall in the east-west 
tunnel and then in the north-south tunnel and the stairs 
reached from the pit. If the party runs out, ask them if 
they thought it was too hard a dungeon. 
Treasure. The jade coffer is worth 5,000 gp and con­
tains six potions of healing. The crown is set with gems 
and worth 25,000 gp. (The gold that makes up the couch 
is worth 50,000 gp, but it can't be moved or damaged.) 
The small sack holds 278 pp, twenty-nine gems worth 
10 gp each, seven spell scrolls (all of 1st-and 2nd-level 
wizard spells), and a map showing a location several 
hundred miles away that supposedly has a rich treasure 
(it is a fake, naturally). 
False Ending. If this outcome doesn't make the play­
ers suspicious enough to take another run through to 
check things out, put the adventure away for use when 
you have a different group (or the same ones) inquiring 
about one of the references in the "Legend of the Tomb." 
Note that something so simple as a commune spell will 
reveal that the demilich has not been destroyed. 
19. LABORATORY AND MUMMY PREPARATION 
ROOM 
Although there is only one item of eventual use within 
this totally plain and cluttered place, the volume of items 
within it is calculated to waste time for the players. 
Describe the features of the room as the characters 
investigate. 
All of the walls are lined with shelves, and upon these 
are old jars filled with dust and impotent ingredients 
of all sorts. There is a large desk and stool, two work­
benches, and two mummy preparation tables. Clay pots 
and urns on these tables and the floor obviously once 
contained unguents, ointments, oils, perfumes, and the 
like. Linen wrappings are in rolls or strewn about. Dried 
herbs of unidentifiable nature, bones, skulls and the like 
litter the workbenches. 
Vats. In the south part of the room are three vats of 
about 7 feet in diameter and 4 feet in depth that contain 
murky liquids. The vats are affixed to the floor and too 
heavy to move. The western one holds only dirty water. 
The middle vat contains a slow-acting acid which will 
deal 3 (ld6) acid damage on the round after a creature's 
flesh comes into substantial contact with it (by immers­
ing an arm, being splashed on, and so forth)-minor 
contact (dipping a finger) will cause only a mild itch. At 
the bottom of this vat is one-half of a golden key. 
The eastern vat contains a grayish substance that is 
actually an ochre jelly that sits atop the other half of the 
golden key. 
Treasure. The key parts are magical and will not be 
harmed by anything . If the parts are joined together they 
form one solid key, hereafter called the First Key. Be­
cause the acid will harm even magic weapons, the play­
ers will have to figure some way to neutralize or drain 
off the contents of the second vat to acquire the key, as a reach-in-and-grope-for-it technique has only a 1 percent 
cumulative chance per round of being successful. 
20. HUGE PIT FILLED WITH SPIKES 
If the characters proceed through the laboratory, they 
come upon a descending staircase that ends at a cor­
ridor heading east. Assuming they can see what lies 
ahead of them, read: 
A ten-foot-deep, empty pit completely tills the passage­
way and extends so far as to make jumping across it im­
possible for most creatures. 
Spike Trap. The characters might deduce that the pit 
can be crossed by climbing down and walking across 
the bottom, then climbing up the other side. Simple! 
Wrong-any footstep upon the last 5 feet (east portion) 
of the pit presses a pressure plate, causing a volley of 
spikes to discharge upward. If the plate is triggered, 
each person in the pit or leaning over its edge is likely 
to be struck by the spikes, which have a +11 bonus to 
hit and deal 11 (2d10) piercing damage. New spikes will 
come up out of the floor every time if the plate is pressed 
more than once. 
A character who succeeds on a DC 20 Wisdom (Per­
ception) check discovers the pressure plate. It can then 
be wedged shut by a character who is adjacent to the 
plate and succeeds on a DC 20 Dexterity check while 
using thieves' tools. On a failed check, it's apparent that 
the block didn't work-unless the check fails by 5 or 
more, in which case the job seems solid but fails when 
someone walks on the plate.

222 21. THE AGITATED CHAMBER 
The secret door to this place can be found with a suc­
cessful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. 
The room appears to be filled with funerary offerings 
and furniture. There are four rotting sofas, a couple of 
throne-like chairs, and a jumble of stands, small tables, 
and vases and urns that are dented, chipped, and broken. 
Only the rather plain tapestries hanging on the east and 
west walls appear to have been spared a rough looting. 
Amid the general havoc are scattered several trunks and 
a larger number of coffers. 
Heaving Floor. The weight of the characters upon the 
balanced floor of this room sets a mechanism into mo­
tion. Each round they remain in the place, on initiative 
count 0, roll a die. An odd-numbered result means that 
the floor of the room willjump and buck up and down 
violently. When the floor does so, each creature in the 
room must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw 
or fall prone and take 1 bludgeoning damage from abra­
sions and contusions. 
Tapestries. The wall hangings, which depict weed­
grown rocks and green and golden tan scenes of under­
sea life, are special, antimagic-treated creations made of 
green slime and brown mold (see "Dungeon Hazards" in 
chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). 
If either tapestry is torn down, it instantly turns into 
green slime and covers a 20-foot-long, 10-foot-wide 
area of floor when it falls. Note that the tapestries can 
be handled normally without risk, just not yanked so as 
to tear them (and they are well affixed at the top); if any 
character is holding one when the room becomes agi­
tated, however, it is 75 percent probable that the jerking 
motion will tear the thing. 
If these hangings are subjected to burning, they in­
stantly turn to brown mold that covers the same area. 
The secret door behind the tapestry on the west wall 
requires the tapestry to be removed, but thereafter can 
be found as easily as the entry door. 
Treasure. The trunks are empty, but the smaller 
coffers hold various items. Roll a d6 each time one is 
opened. On a roll of 1-3, the coffer contains ld3 poison­
ous snakes. On a roll of 4-5, 8d10 pp are found. On a 
roll of 6, the coffer holds 2d4 gems (worth 10 gp each). 
22. THE CAVERN OF GOLD AND SILVER MISTS 
A thick silver mist, shot through with delicate stream­
ers of gold, partially blocks your view of the area that 
lies ahead. 
The mists make the entire area heavily obscured. A 
detect evil and good spell cast in the area, or a paladin's 
use of Divine Sense, indicates that this is a conse­
crated place. 
Any creature that steps into the mist must make a DC 
15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the crea-
CHAPTER 7 I TOMB OF HORRORS cure·s Intelligence and Charisma scores become 1. The 
creature can't cast spells, activate magic items, under-
rand language, or communicate in any intelligible way. 
The creature can, however, identify its friends, follow 
them. and even protect them. This effect lasts until the 
character can breathe the clean air above ground under 
the warm sun. 
Creature. At the center of the cavern is a small grotto 
in which dwells the fey being Siren (see appendix B). As 
a private joke, Acererak placed her in this cavern under 
an enchantment. She must be asked to come out of the 
chamber in order to break the spell, and she can give no 
clues as to the nature of her durance. If the characters 
come close enough, they can see that two sacks, a large 
one and a small one, are lying on the floor next to her. 
Siren will converse in a friendly fashion, asking how 
characters are and if they find the going hard in the 
tomb. Because of the enchantment, she will answer 
any direct questions with an evasive reply: "I cannot 
say," "That is unknown to me," "Possibly," and so forth 
unless she is freed. She knows nothing of the tomb in 
any event. 
If the characters ask her to come with them and are 
kind, she will do so and stay with them through the rest 
of the adventure. 
Treasure. Both of Siren's sacks contain treasure, but 
it isn't possible to acquire more than one of hem-and 
in fact both of the sacks will disappear if she is asked to 
accompany the party. If a character touches one of the 
sacks before she is asked to come along, she and the 
other sack immediately disappear. 
The large sack contains 50 pieces each of copper, sil­
ver, electrum, gold and platinum. It appears to be a nor­
mal sack, but it has a magical aura if it is checked, for it 
is a bag of holding. 
To determine the contents of the small sack, roll a dlO: 
dlO Contents 
1-2 Filled with wool 
3-4 Five pieces of jewelry 
5-6 ld6 potions of greater healing 
7 ld6 spell scrolls, each of a wizard spell of 5th level or 
lower (DM's choice) 
8 4dl2 gems (worth 100 gp each) 
9 Bracers of defense 
l O Ring of feather falling 
It isn't possible to gain both the large and the small 
sacks by any means. If a character or characters state 
they will grab them simultaneously, roll dice to see 
which sack is touched a fraction of a second sooner. The 
other disappears-along with Siren-forever. 
23. FALSE/TRUE DOOR 
When the party opens the door that promises to offer 
access to the north, it is probable that they will believe it 
to be nothing more than a false door, but the seemingly 
blank wall of solid stone behind the false door hides a 
secret door, which can be found with a successful DC 15 
Wisdom (Perception) check. 
Secret Trapdoor. On the other side of the secret door 
is a secret trapdoor in the floor of the corridor, requiring 
a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check to find. 

--- PAGE 224 ---

The trapdoor opens onto a steep flight of narrow tairs 
that spiral down to a 5-foot-wide tunnel which emerges 
at area 24. 
23A. KNOCKOUT CORRIDOR 
If the characters don't find the tunnel or choose not to 
follow it, they move through a door that leads east and 
then come upon a set of double doors in the north wall. 
When the doors to the north are opened, sleep gas bil­
lows forth from the other side. Each creature in the east­
west passage must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution 
saving throw or fall unconscious for 2d4 x 10 minutes. 
Rolling Stone. Every 10 minutes after the gas is 
released, roll a d4. On a roll of 4, a stone juggernaut 
(rather like a steam roller) comes out of the 20-foot­
square room to the north and rolls ld6 x 10 feet south, 
then west. Everything it rolls over is squashed to a pulp. 
There is no appeal. 
24. ADAMANTINE DOOR 
The tunnel from the south emerges into a corridor that 
then heads east. The door at the end is a great block of 
adamantine. It has permanent antimagic effects on it, 
and there is no magical or physical way of forcing entry. 
There are three slots in the door at about waist height. 
If sword blades are shoved simultaneously into all the 
slots, the 1-foot-thick door will swing open. Five rounds 
later, the door slams shut. There is no way of opening it 
from the west side. 
25. PILLARED THRONE ROOM 
You look upon an enormous chamber colored in pas­
tels. A forest of massive, many-hued columns support 
the ceiling. 
Aura. Each of the 3-foot-diameter pillars radiates an 
aura of transmutation magic when such is detected for. 
Upwardly Mobile. Any character who touches a pillar 
with or without intent will uncontrollably float upward 
(as if affected by a levitate spell), then bounce gently 
around on the ceiling, 30 feet above, just as a helium 
balloon. To stop this effect, a dispel magic or remove 
curse spell must be placed upon each such individual. 
There seems to be a gentle breeze in the room, for any 
character floating among the many-hued columns will 
begin drifting toward the northwest or northeast corner 
of the room. From the entry an observant character with 
a suitable light source will be able to observe part of the 
dais on the south wall and the door at area 27. 
Northwest Devil Face. About 24 feet above the floor 
in the northwest corner, on the north wall, is a mosaic 
relief sculpture of a green devil's face which appears to 
be exactly the same as that first encountered in the en­
trance hall to the tomb (area 3). Any creature that comes 
within 3 feet of its gaping mouth will be sucked in and 
instantly teleported, to be "spat out" nude at area 6, 
while all non-living matter in the character's possession 
goes to area 33. 
Northeast Devil Face. The sculpture in the northeast 
corner is identical in size and placement to the one in the other corner, but it is tinged with a bluish color over 
the green. Any character that enters the mouth opening 
of this devil face is teleported to area 27 A. 
Charred Remains. Strewn near the southeast corner 
is a heap of charred bones and skulls, plus the crisped 
and blackened remains of clothing and gear, arms and 
armor-a thoroughly awful and frightening sight. A 
character who comes close enough to examine the re­
mains will find a huge, glowing orange gem at the center 
of the destruction. 
Cursed Gem. The gem can be easily claimed. Casting 
a detect evil and good spell reveals it to be a desecrated 
object. On a casting of detect magic, the gem gives off a 
strong aura of conjuration -so strong that the detecting 
character will get the vague feeling that the wish spell is 
involved in the gem's magic. 
The gem is actually a cursed magic item. If any char­
acter touches it and attempts to cast a wish spell using 
it, a reversed or distorted version of the wish's fulfill­
ment will bring harm to that character and all named 
in the wish. 
Then, immediately after the evil wish spell has trans­
pired, the gem begins to pulse with reddish lights, 
growing progressively stronger, brighter and hotter. Roll 
initiative. On initiative count 1, the stone explodes, abso­
lutely killing any character within a 15-foot radius in a 
wave of searing radiation and flames. The gem remains 
as a noisome mass of stinking purplish mold which 
bubbles and chuckles. In one week the mass will again 
re-form as a glowing orange gem. 
CHAPTER 7 I TOMB OF HORRORS 223 

--- PAGE 225 ---

Ebony Dais and Silver Throne. When the characters 
come close enough to see the details on the dais, read: 
Contrasting with the pastel colors of the floor and pillars 
of the hall is the stark blackness of the huge dais on the 
south wall, atop which sits an obsidian throne inlaid 
with silver and ivory skulls. Upon the throne rest a crown 
made of gold and a scepter made of electrum, with a 
gold knob on one end and a silver cap on the other. 
Aura. The crown and both ends of the scepter prove to 
be magical if such is detected for. In addition, the crown 
and the gold knob of the scepter radiate an aura of ab­
juration magic, and the silver end of the scepter has an 
aura of necromancy magic. 
Crown and Scepter. The crown negates the pillars' 
levitation effect for anyone who dons it and enables the 
wearer to see within the hall as if in normal daylight­
but outside this place the wearer is blind. As soon as a 
creature puts on the crown, the wearer knows that the 
crown can be removed only by touching the scepter to it, 
but doesn't find out the exact procedure . 
If the golden knob is touched to the crown, the wearer 
can remove the headgear. If the silver end of the scepter 
is touched to the crown, the wearer is instantly snuffed 
out, turning to a fetid powder that can't be brought back 
to life no matter what (wish spells notwithstanding). 
Treasure. Each of these items is obviously valuable 
(25,000 gp for the crown, 12,500 gp for the scepter), but 
both are cursed. If they are removed from the tomb, the 
possessor of either item will be visited by a vrock sent 
to reclaim the item and return it to the throne room-or 
by two such demons if a single character has both items. 
Throne Passage. A character who examines the 
throne and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) 
check discovers a small replica of the crown inlaid in 
silver on the lower front panel of the seat. If the silver 
end of the scepter is applied to this inlay, the throne 
sinks down and reveals a 5-foot-wide passageway that 
leads south. 
26. SMALL ROOM WITH A DOOR OF ELECTRIC 
BLUE 
The two doors near the northern corners of the throne 
room look the same. When a character comes within 
10 feet of either one, it can be seen that the door actu­
ally shimmers with a faint blue light. When the door 
is touched, this glimmering grows bright. A brass pull 
beckons to be used, and the door will open easily. Inside 
the western room there is nothing but dust. The eastern 
room is another matter. 
If the eastern door is opened, the characters will see 
a low stone table upon which rests a wooden sarcoph­
agus. Various broken and looted urns and coffers are 
scattered about. Inside the sarcophagus are the parts 
of a mummy (not an undead, exactly, for at this time it 
is the mummified remains of a human) with wrappings 
partially undone and tattered. 
Treasure. A huge amethyst, worth 5,000 gp, is barely 
visible between the wrappings that cover the mummy's 
CHAPTER 7 I TOMB OF HORRORS head. A character who examines the mummy and suc­
ceeds on a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check can dis­
cO\·er it in one of the eye sockets. 
Creature. The gem has an evil magic placed upon it, 
and if it is removed from the mummy, the remains be­
come a true mummy lord that has no spells and no leg­
endary actions (defeating it awards half XP). Magic upon 
the mummy lord's wrappings makes them nonflamma­
ble, and the creature wears a ring of resistance (fire). 
27. THE PORTAL OF SCINTILLATING VIOLET 
The door in the center of the north wall of the throne 
room appears to lead to another small room. Like the 
two near the corners, this one gives off a faint glow 
when viewed from 10 feet away, though this light is of a 
lilac color. 
When this door is touched, the light changes to a 
bright and coruscating purple with tinges of sickly 
green. If a character opens the door, read: 
You see a bare chamber, with a small door on the north 
wall, and pairs of swords crossed behind shields hung 
upon the walls. There are three such sets on each of the 
walls to either hand, and two sets on the north wall, one 
flanking each side of the door. 
Creatures. If the threshold of the chamber is crossed 
by any creature, one set of swords will fly off the wall 
and attack the individual so doing. The two flying 
swords will both attack, and the shield (statistics as the 
swords, but no attacks) will interpose itself to take hits 
meant for the swords. This trio will attack until they are 
destroyed or the one who violated their area is dead. 
Surviving weapons and shields return to their former 
positions after the offender is hacked to pieces. 
Worse still, if the threshold is crossed a second time, 
another pair of blades and a shield will attack, and each 
set gains a cumulative + 1 bonus to attack and damage 
rolls, as well as 1 hit point more than the previous set. 
Only the following spells will affect these items: teleki­
nesis sends all three items of a set back to their original 
position; heat metal will cause one item to fall to pieces; 
disintegrate will destroy all items of a set; magic weapon 
will cause a sword to become a plain iron weapon. 
27A. CHAMBER OF HOPELESSNESS 
Any creature unfortunate enough to be teleported here 
from area 25 is doomed, for its fate is clearly stated in 
glowing letters magically written on the north wall of 
the place. If someone arrives here, read: 
"You who dared to violate my tomb now pay the price. 
Stay here and die slowly of starvation, or open and 
enter the door to the south, where certain but quick 
death awaits. 
"Whichever you choose, know that I, Acererak the Eter­
nal, watch and scoff at your puny efforts and enjoy your 
death throes." 

--- PAGE 226 ---

Fountain. A small stream of water spills from a wall 
outlet into a basin and drains away through side holes. 
so there is always plenty to drink. (It is impossible to 
flood the place, for there are hundreds of small drain 
holes in the walls and floor.) 
Treasure. There are numerous skeletons here. rotting 
equipment, and 30d10 each of sp, ep, gp, and pp hurled 
about. Searching through the remains will yield 2d10 
gems (worth 10 gp each), a potion of diminution, and 
a +l flail. 
Swords and Shields. If the door to the south is 
opened from this side, all the swords and shields in 
area 27 swoop from the walls to attack, but they cease 
as soon as the door opener retreats into the chamber to 
the north. 
28. THE WONDROUS FOYER 
The narrow passage behind the throne leads to a 
10-foot-wide landing and a series of steps which become 
wider to the south as they ascend. When a character 
reaches the landing and is able to see the steps, read: 
The walls of the area ahead are untarnished and gleam­
ing copper panels set between rare woods inlaid with 
ivory. The ceiling is silver, formed so as to reflect and 
amplify light brought into the place. The chamber widens 
to the south, where a set of gently sloping steps leads 
upward. The six steps, from nearest to farthest, are made 
of onyx, pink marble, la pis, black marble, yellow serpen­
tine, and malachite. 
Upon the black marble step is a large, cylindrical key 
of bronze, hereafter called the Second Key, for all to 
behold. It has an antipathy /sympathy spell cast upon it 
(save DC 17) that repels humanoids (the antipathy ef­
fect). At the head of the steps are a pair of huge doors. 
29. THE VALVES OF MITHRAL 
The doors at the top of the stairs are 14 feet wide and 28 
feet tall. They are made of solid mithral, 3 feet thick, and 
impregnated with great magics in order to make them 
absolutely spell-and magic-proof. 
Keyhole. Where these valves meet, at about waist 
height, is a cup-like depression, a hemispherical concav­
ity with a central hole. The hole appears to fit the Sec­
ond Key, but if it is inserted, the character so doing will 
take 5 (ldlO) lightning damage. Anyone so foolish as to 
insert the First Key (from area 19) will take double that 
amount of damage. 
True Key. The real key to these great gates is the 
scepter from area 25. If the gold knob is inserted into 
the depression , the mithral doors will swing silently 
open. If the silver end of the scepter is touched to the 
hemispherical cup the holder of the instrument will be 
teleported instantly to be spat out of the devil's mouth 
at area 6, nude, while all non-living materials with the 
individual go to area 33, and the crown and the scepter 
reappear on the throne. 
Blood Trap. If the door is attacked by force it will not 
budge, but if it is scratched or nicked it will turn red in thatspot, and if it is cut by a sharp weapon it will begin 
to gush forth blood-the blood of all those who have 
died within the tomb! The red flow will cascade down 
the steps and fill the area to the top of the southernmost 
step in 6 rounds, and each round thereafter it will rise 
higher and encompass one more step. If unchecked, 
the flow of blood will fill the foyer to the ceiling in 
20 rounds. 
Fire of any sort, magical or otherwise, turns the blood 
to a poison gas, which is fatal, and all characters in the 
foyer area are dead, with no saving throw, while any in 
the 5-foot-wide passage to the throne room are slain un­
less they succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. 
Casting one or more cure wounds spells on the door 
in any combination that expends four spell slots (such 
as four 1st-level castings, two 2nd-level , or one 4th-level) 
will stanch the flow of blood, as will a heal spell. If other 
magic is used against the blood, only the following 
spells will have any effect: 
Cone of cold freezes the blood and halts the flow 
for 3 rounds. 
Create or destroy water turns the blood to water. 
Disintegrate destroys all the blood. 
Levitate coagulates the blood and causes it to rise up as 
a Huge red ochre jelly. 
Polymorph changes the blood into seven wights, which 
attack immediately. 
Purify food and drink turns all the blood to poison gas. 
A character caught in the gas must succeed on a DC 
15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned 
for 48 hours. 
Raise dead or resurrection destroys all the blood and 
causes a shade to appear on the top stair. The shade 
blesses the characters so that they benefit as if they 
had just finished a long rest. 
30. FALSE TREASURE ROOM 
This imposing chamber has a silvered ceiling, just as the 
foyer has, so it is brightly illuminated by reflected light. 
The walls are of ivory with gold inlaid. The floor is pol­
ished agate. In each corner stands a statue of black iron, 
easily nine feet tall. That to the northeast stands with a 
saw-toothed two-handed sword raised to strike; that to 
the northwest a huge, spike-ended mace; to the south­
east the sculpture holds a wickedly spiked morning star, 
and the one in the southwest has a voulge. 
Near the center of the room is a large bronze urn fili­
greed in gold. A thin stream of smoke issues from a tiny 
vent in its brass stopper. On the southern wall stands a 
granite sarcophagus that appears to be damaged. Flank­
ing the sarcophagus are two large iron chests. 
The room is lined with lead and has antimagic proper­
ties, so no spells will work within the room, and no mag­
ical properties of items of any sort will properly function 
except those that detect an aura of magic or a place of 
desecration. 
CHAPTER 7 I TOMB OF HORRORS 225 

--- PAGE 227 ---

226 Statues. Each statue has a magical aura, but they are 
merely hunks of metal; they do nothing. Each registers 
to the casting of detect evil and good as a desecrated ob­
ject, and the visage of each of these iron statues is most 
fearsome and terrifying. 
Moving a statue can be done, but it requires a com­
bined Strength of 48. Moving the statue in the north­
west corner reveals a ring pull in the western wall 
which will raise a small plug of stone and enable the 
party to enter a small chute which takes them into the 
corridor that goes west. 
Bronze Urn. A character who examines the urn can 
use an action to pry loose the stopper. If the stopper is 
removed, an efreeti will come forth. If the urn has been 
battered, knocked about, shaken, overturned, or other­
wise roughly handled, the creature will be in a fury and 
will attack. If not, it will grant three wishes for the party 
and then depart. 
Sarcophagus. Examining the lid of the sarcophagus 
reveals that glyphs spelling "ACERERAK" are inset on 
it in platinum. (The metal, worth 100 pp in total, can be 
pried out.) The end of the thing nearest the wall is stove 
in and shattered. Inside can be seen bits of a wooden 
inner shell, a few bones, destroyed jewelry (the stones 
pried out), torn bits of robes and windings, dust, and a 
broken staff of the magi (evident from the runes upon it). 
A shattered skull will roll out if the contents are moved 
around. (Why, the demilich has long been destroyed, but 
his magical traps somehow survived!) 
Iron Chests. Each of these massive boxes is embed­
ded into the stone. Neither can possibly be moved, and 
both show marks of prying, battering, and similar treat­
ment. Each chest is triple-locked, and each lock contains 
a poison needle trap (see "Sample Traps" in chapter 5 of 
the Dungeon Master's Guide). If the trap is triggered by 
a failed check, it deals 1 piercing damage and delivers 
a dose of purple worm poison (see "Sample Poisons" in 
chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). 
Treasure. Both chests have treasure, the true nature 
of which doesn't become apparent until the spoils are 
moved at least 13 miles away from the tomb. 
The eastern chest holds 10,000 gems, which will 
initially appear to be of not less than 50 gp value each. 
Each is actually a 1 gp piece of quartz. The other chest 
contains 10,000 copper pieces magicked to appear as 
platinum when they are first discovered. 
31. ONE-WAY DOORS 
Characters who traverse the east-west corridor have 
no chance of discovering the north-south route that 
adjoins it. The two doors to the north are magical, such 
that they don't exist except for characters who approach 
and open them from the north. 
Phasing Pit. The covered pit depicted on the map 
doesn't exist until someone opens either of the one-way 
doors or opens the door in the corridor while traveling 
east to west. When one of those events occurs, the cov­
ered pit comes into phase where shown. This pit is oth­
erwise exactly the same as others in the place. 
CHAPTER 7 I TOMB OF HORRORS 32. SECRET DOOR 
The portal to the south can't be detected by any magical 
means. but a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) 
check enables a character to notice that the wall at this 
location has a small opening that is metal-lined -obvi­
ously a keyhole! 
Following this discovery, any attempt to force the door 
open by physical or magical means will be useless. But 
if the First Key (from area 19) is inserted in the hole and 
then removed, the door will sink into the floor, revealing 
itself to be a stone-sheathed adamantine slab of tremen­
dous thickness. There can be no real doubt that the end 
of the adventure -one way or another-is near. 
33. THE CRYPT OF ACERERAK THE DEMILICH 
l Beyond the door is a smallish, rectangular chamber with 
a ceiling that extends twenty-five feet overhead . There is 
l a smaii depression a few inches deep and about two feet 
square in the center of the floor. 
A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check enables 
a character to discover a small hole in the middle of this 
depression-another keyhole! 
If the First Key is inserted herein, the key explodes, 
and the individual doing so takes 17 (5d6) bludgeon­
ing damage. I 
The Second Key (from area 28) will fit within the hole, 
and nothing untoward will occur. In fact, nothing what­
soever will happen until it is turned three times to the 
right in succession. If this is done, read: 
I As you finish turning the key, the floor begins to tremble, 
and then abruptly it starts to rise toward the ceiling. 
Roll initiative. On initiative count 10, anyone still on the 
southern 15 feet of the crypt floor is crushed against the 
roof and slain. If any characters survive, read: 
The rising of the floor in the southern part of the room 
reveals a mithral vault. There is a door in the center of 
the device, with a ring set into it. 
A hard pull will open the door. 
A low, dust-covered bench is near the back wall of the 
vault. On and around it are an abundance of items. Rest· 
ing on one end of it is a human skull. 
Creature. The skull belongs to Acererak, the demilich 
who lies in wait for the characters. When they joined the 
halves of the First Key, that act called his soul back to 
the Material Plane, and their use of the Second Key to 
enter the vault alerted him that he must be prepared to 
do battle in order to survive yet more centuries. 

--- PAGE 228 ---

All that now remains of Acererak the lich are the dust 
of his bones. This bit is enough! If any of the treasure 
in the crypt is touched, the dust swirls into the air and 
forms a man-like shape. If this shape is ignored, it 
will dissipate in 3 rounds, for it can only advance and 
threaten, not harm. Any physical attack will give it 1 
point of energy, however, and a damaging spell cast on 
it gives it a number of points of energy equal to the level 
of the spell slot expended (1 point for a cantrip). Each 
point of energy is equivalent to a hit point, and if 50 hit 
points are thus gained, the dust will form into a ghost 
controlled by Acererak, and this thing will attack imme­
diately. (The dust will seem to waver and fall back if it is 
struck by blow or spell, as if suffering actual damage, so 
formation of the ghost isn't too improbable.) 
If any character is so foolish as to touch the skull of 
the demilich, a terrible thing occurs. Acererak rises 
into the air upon the touch, and it slowly scans the party 
prior to attacking. The demilich has the Trap the Soul 
action and access to its lair actions, but not lair traits. It 
can tell which members of the party are the most power­
ful, and it uses Trap the Soul on them first. 
There are two jewels set into the skull's eye sockets 
(50,000 gp rubies) and six pointed (marquis cut) dia­
monds set as teeth in the jaw (each diamond is worth 
5,000 gp). If all these gems are filled with souls and the 
skull is still intact and still being opposed, it will pro­
nounce a curse upon the remaining characters which 
will teleport them randomly in a 300-mile radius, each subjected to a bestow curse spell (save DC 17) that lasts 
until dispelled. If the curse is removed, the character 
must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed 
save, the character must permanently decrease one 
ability score by 2, or two ability scores by 1 each. This 
secondary effect is instantaneous and can't be dispelled. 
Treasure. Characters who survive the demilich's 
wrath can claim any loot they can carry. Inside the vault 
are these items: 
• All items possessed by characters who were tele­
ported nude 
• Ninety-seven small gems worth 10 gp each 
• Three huge gems-a 10,000 gp peridot, a 50,000 gp 
emerald, and a 100,000 gp black opal 
• Four magic weapons -a defender, a sword of ven­
geance, a berserker axe, and a spear of backbiting (see 
appendix A) 
In addition, the hoard contains several magic items of 
your choosing (except that none can be of legendary rar­
ity), including: 
, Twelve potions 
Six spell scrolls, each of a wizard spell of 5th 
level or lower 
• One magic ring, one magic rod, one magic staff, and 
three wondrous items 
This ends the expedition to the Tomb of Horrors. We 
hope you and your players have found it exciting, chal­
lenging, and rewarding.

228 APPENDIX A: MAGIC ITEMS 
The magic items that are introduced in this book are de­
tailed here in alphabetical order. The adventure in which 
an item appears is given at the end of its description. 
AMULET OF PROTECTION FROM TURNING 
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement) 
While you wear this amulet of silver and turquoise , you 
have advantage on saving throws against effects that 
turn undead. 
If you fail a saving throw against such an effect, you 
can choose to succeed instead. You can do so three 
times, and expended uses recharge daily at dawn. 
Each time an effect that turns undead is used against 
you, the amulet glows with silvery blue light for a few 
seconds. (The Hidden Shrine ofTamoachan) 
BALANCE OF HARMONY 
Wondrous item, uncommon 
This scale bears celestial symbols on one pan and fiend­
ish symbols on the other. You can use the scale to cast 
detect evil and good as a ritual. Doing so requires you to 
place the scale on a solid surface, then sprinkle the pans 
with holy water or place a transparent gem worth 100 
gp in each pan. The scale remains motionless if it de­
tects nothing, tips to one side or the other for good (con­
secrated) or evil (desecrated) , and fluctuates slightly if 
it detects a creature appropriate to the spell but neither 
good nor evil. By touching the scales after casting the 
ritual, you instantly learn any information the spell can 
normally convey, and then the effect ends. (The Hidden 
Shrine ofTamoachan) 
BRACELET OF ROCK MAGIC 
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement) 
While you wear this gold bracelet, it grants you immu­
nity to being petrified, and it allows you to cast flesh 
to stone (save DC 15) as an action. Once the spell has 
been cast three times, the bracelet can no longer cast it. 
Thereafter , you can cast stone shape as an action. After 
you have done this thirteen times, the bracelet loses its 
magic and turns from gold to lead. 
Curse. The bracelet's affinity with earth manifests as 
an unusual curse. Creatures of flesh that are strongly 
related to earth and stone, such as stone giants and 
dwarves, have advantage on the saving throw against 
flesh to stone cast from the bracelet. If such a creature's 
save is successful , the bracelet breaks your attunement 
to it and casts the spell on you. You make your saving 
throw with disadvantage, and on a failed save you are 
petrified instantly. (The Hidden Shrine ofTamoachan) 
EAGLE WHISTLE 
Wondrous item, rare 
While you blow an eagle whistle continuously, you can 
fly twice as fast as your walking speed. You can blow 
the whistle continuously for a number of rounds equal 
to 5 + five times your Constitution modifier (minimum 
of 1 round) or until you talk, hold your breath, or start 
suffocating. A use of the whistle also ends if you land. If 
APPENDIX A J MAGIC ITEMS you are aloft when you stop blowing the whistle, you fall. 
The whistle has three uses. It regains expended uses 
daily at dawn. (The Hidden Shrine ofTamoachan) 
HELL HOUND CLOAK 
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement) 
This dark cloak is made of cured hell hound hide. As 
an action, you can command the cloak to transform you 
into a hell hound for up to 1 hour. The transformation 
otherwise functions as the polymorph spell, but you can 
use a bonus action to revert to your normal form. 
Curse. This cloak is cursed with the essence of a hell 
hound, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse 
to you. Until the curse is broken with remove curse or 
similar magic, you are unwilling to part with the cloak, 
keeping it within reach at all times. 
The sixth time you use the cloak, and each time there­
after, you must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. 
On a failed save, the transformation lasts until dispelled 
or until you drop to O hit points, and you can't willingly 
return to normal form. If you ever remain in hell hound 
form for 6 hours, the transformation becomes perma­
nent and you lose your sense of self. All your statistics 
are then replaced by those of a hell hound. Thereafter, 
only remove curse or similar magic allows you to regain 
your identity and return to normal. If you remain in this 
permanent form for 6 days, only a wish spell can reverse 
the transformation. (Against the Giants) 
LOAD STONE 
Wondrous item, rare 
This stone is a large gem worth 150 gp. 
Curse. The stone is cursed, but its magical nature is 
hidden; detect magic doesn't detect it. An identify spell 
reveals the stone's true nature. If you use the Dash or 
Disengage action while the stone is on your person, its 
curse activates. Until the curse is broken with remove 
curse or similar magic, your speed is reduced by 5 feet, 
and your maximum load and maximum lift capacities 
are halved. You also become unwilling to part with the 
stone. (Dead in Thay) 
MIRROR OF THE PAST 
Wondrous item, rare 
The holder of this platinum hand mirror can learn some­
thing about the history of a specific object or creature by 
taking an action to gaze into the mirror and think of the 
target. Instead of the holder's reflection , the mirror pres­
ents scenes from the target's past. Information conveyed 
is accurate, but it is random and cryptic, and presented 
in no particular order. Once it is activated, the mirror 
gives its information for 1 minute or less, then returns to 
normal. It can't be used again until the next dawn. (The 
Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan) 
NIGHT CALLER 
Wondrous item, uncommon 
This whistle is carved from transparent crystal, and it 
resembles a tiny dragon curled up like a snail. The name 

--- PAGE 230 ---

Night Caller is etched on the whistle in Dwarvish runes. 
If a character succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligen ce (Arcana 
or History) check, the character recalls lore that says the 
duergar made several such whistles for various groups 
in an age past. 
If you blow the whistle in darkness or under the night 
sky, it allows you to cast the animate dead spell. The 
target can be affected through up to 10 feet of soft earth 
or similar material, and if it is, it takes 1 minute to claw 
its way to the surface to serve you. Once the whistle has 
animated an undead creature, it can't do so again until 7 
days have passed. 
Once every 24 hours, you can blow the whistle to re­
assert control over one or two creatures you animated 
with it. (The Sunless Citadel) 
POTION OF MIND CONTROL 
Potion, rarity varies 
When you drink a potion of mind control, you can cast a 
dominate spell (save DC 15) on a specific creature if you 
do so before the end of your next turn. If you don't, the 
potion is wasted. 
A potion of mind control produces the effect of a dom­
inate beast, a dominate person (humanoid), or a domi­
nate monster spell (see the table below). If the target's 
initial saving throw fails, the effect lasts for 1 hour, with 
no concentration required on your part. The charmed 
creature has disadvantage on new saving throws to 
break the effect during this time. (Against the Giants) 
Potion of ... 
Mind control (beast) 
Mind control (humanoid) 
Mind control (monster) 
ROBE OF SUMMER Rarity 
Rare 
Rare 
Very rare 
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement) 
This elegant garment is made from fine cloth in hues of 
red, orange, and gold. While you wear the robe, you have 
resistance to cold damage. In addition, you are comfort­
able as if the temperature were that of a balmy day, so 
you suffer no ill effects from the weather's temperature 
extremes. (Dead in Thay) 
SHATTERSPIKE 
Weapon (longsword) , uncommon (requires attunement) 
You have a +l bonus to attack and damage rolls you 
make with this magic weapon. If it hits an object, the hit 
is automatically a critical hit, and it can deal bludgeon­
ing or slashing damage to the object (your choice). Fur­
ther, damage from nonmagical sources can't harm the 
weapon. (The Sunless Citadel) 
SPEAR OF BACKBIT! G 
Weapon (spear or javelin), very rare (requires attune­
ment) 
You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made 
with this magic weapon. When you throw it, its normal 
and long ranges both increase by 30 feet. and it deals 
one extra die of damage on a hie. After you throw it and 
it hits or misses, it flies back co your hand immediately. Curse. This weapon is cursed, and becoming attuned 
to it extends the curse to you. Until the curse is broken 
with remove curse or similar magic, you are unwilling 
to part with the weapon, keeping it within reach at all 
times. In addition, you have disadvantage on attack rolls 
made with weapons other than this one. 
Whenever you roll a 1 on an attack roll using this 
weapon, the weapon bends or flies to hit you in the back. 
Make a new attack roll with advantage against your own 
AC. If the result is a hit, you take damage as if you had 
attacked yourself with the spear. (Tomb of Horrors) 
STONE OF ILL LUCK 
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement) 
This polished agate appears to be a stone of good luck to 
anyone who tries to identify it, and it confers that item's 
property while on your person. 
Curse. This item is cursed. While it is on your per­
son, you take a -2 penalty to ability checks and saving 
throws. Until the curse is discovered, the DM secretly 
applies this penalty, assuming you are adding the item's 
bonus. You are unwilling to part with the stone until the 
curse is broken with remove curse or similar magic. 
(The Hidden Shrine ofTamoachan) 
WAND OF ENTANGLE 
Wand, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster) 
This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use 
an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast the entangle 
spell (save DC 13) from it. 
The wand regains ld6 + 1 expended charges daily at 
dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. 
On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed. 
(The Sunless Citadel) 
WAYTHE 
Weapon (greatsword), legendary (requires attunement) 
Waythe is a unique greatsword most recently in the pos­
session of a high-ranking cloud giant ambassador. 
You gain a +l bonus to attack and damage rolls made 
with this magic weapon. When you hit a creature of the 
giant type with it, the giant takes an extra 2d6 slashing 
damage, and it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength sav­
ing throw or fall prone. 
The sword also functions as a wand of enemy detec­
tion. It regains all of its expended charges at dawn and 
isn't at risk of crumbling if its last charge is used. 
Sentience. Waythe is a sentient weapon of neutral 
good alignment , with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 
2, and a Charisma of 14. It has hearing and darkvision 
out to a range of 120 feet. 
The weapon can speak and understand Giant and 
Common, and it can communicate telepathically with 
its wielder. 
Personality. This sword believes in freedom and 
allowing others to live as they see fit. It is protective of 
its friends, and wants to be friends with a like-minded 
wielder. (It takes only 1 minute for a good-aligned char­
acter to gain attunement with the sword.) Waythe is 
courageous to the point of foolhardiness, however, and 
vocally urges bold action. It is likely to come into conflict 
with an evil or a timid wielder. (Against the Giants)

APPENDIX B: CREATURES 
This appendix details creatures and nonplayer char­
acters that are mentioned in this book and that don't 
appear in the Monster Manual. That book's introduction 
explains how to interpret a stat block. 
Some of these creatures are available in Volo's 
Guide to Monsters but are reproduced here for your 
convenience. 
The creatures are presented in alphabetical order. 
ANIMATED TABLE 
Some of the defenders of the fortress in The Forge 
of Fury are animated objects that were crafted long 
ago by the dwarf mage Arundil. They include the ani­
mated table. 
Constructed Nature. An animated table doesn't re­
quire air, food, drink, or sleep. 
BARGHEST 
Vicious and intelligent canines from the Lower Planes, 
barghests can be encountered inside the Doomvault. 
Unlike other creatures of their ilk, the barghests in 
Dead in Thay can be bargained with because they resent 
their imprisonment, and thus they might become allies 
(after a fashion) of the player characters .

Antimagic Susceptibility. The table is incapacitated while in the 
area of an antimagic field. If targeted by dispel magic, the table 
must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the cast­
er's spell save DC or fall unconscious for 1 minute. 
False Appearance. While the table remains motionless, it is in­
distinguishable from a normal table. 
Charge. If the table moves at least 20 feet straight toward a 
target and then hits it with a ram attack on the same turn, the 
target takes an extra 9 (2d8) bludgeoning damage. If the target 
is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw 
or be knocked prone.

Shapechanger. The barghest can use its action to polymorph 
into a Small goblin or back into its true form. Other than its 
size and speed, its statistics are the same in each form. Any 
equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. The bar­
ghest reverts to its true form if it dies. 
Fire Banishment. When the barghest starts its turn engulfed in 
flames that are at least 10 feet high or wide, it must succeed on 
a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be instantly banished to Ge­
henna. Instantaneous bursts of flame (such as a red dragon's 
breath or a fireball spell) don't have this effect on the barghest. 
Keen Smell. The barghest has advantage on Wisdom (Percep­
tion) checks that rely on smell. 
Innate Spellcasting. The barghest's innate spellcasting ability is 
Charisma (spell save DC 12). The barghest can innately cast the 
following spells, requiring no material components: 
At will: levitate, minor illusion, pass without trace 
1/day each: charm person, dimension door, suggestion

Hit: 8 (ld8 + 4) slashing damage.

CENTAUR MUMMY 
In The Hidden Shrine ofTamoachan , characters must 
contend with a mummified centaur that wants to prevent 
them from moving any farther into the dungeon. Com­
bining the most lethal features of two creature types, 
the centaur mummy can attack nearby targets with its 
melee weapons while trying to use its Dreadful Glare 
against enemies that hold back.

Charge. If the centaur mummy moves at least 20 feet straight 
toward a target and then hits it with a pike attack on the same 
turn, the target takes an extra 10 (3d6) piercing damage. 
ACTIONS 
Multiattack. The centaur mummy makes two melee attacks, 
one with its pike and one with its hooves, or it attacks with its 
pike and uses Dreadful Glare.

Hit: 10 (ldlO + 5) piercing damage. 
Hooves. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic 
damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 
Constitution saving throw or be cursed with mummy rot. The 
cursed target can't regain hit points, and its hit point maximum 
decreases by 10 (3d6) for every 24 hours that elapse. If the 
curse reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target 
dies, and its body turns to dust. The curse lasts until removed 
by the remove curse spell or similar magic. 
Dreadful Glare. The centaur mummy targets one creature it can 
see within 60 feet of it. lfthe target can see the mummy, the 
target must succeed on a DC 12 w·sdom saving throw against 
this magic or become frightened until the end of the mummy's 
next turn. If the target fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it is 
also paralyzed for the same duration. A target that succeeds on 
the saving throw is immune to the Dreadfu Glare of all mum­
mies (but not mummy lords) for tne next 24 hours. CHAMPION 
One of the most remote locations inside White Plume 
Mountain is the hideout of a band of criminals led by the 
fallen champion Sir Bluto, an alleged mass murderer

erything in their power to ensure that anyone who hap­
pens upon their sanctum doesn't live to tell of it.

ing upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an 
ability check. 
ACTIONS 
Multiattack. The choker makes two tentacle attacks. 
Tentacle. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one tar­
get. Hit: 5 (ld4 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (ld6) piercing 
damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is grap­
pled (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is re­
strained, and the choker can't use this tentacle on another tar­
get (the choker has two tentacles). If this attack is a critical hit, 
the target also can't breathe or speak until the grapple ends. 
APPENDIX B I CREATURES CHOKER 
The choker (from Dead in Thay) is a malevolent , other­
worldly creature that relies on stealth and strangulation 
to put down its enemies. Two long arms extend from its 
scrawny body, functioning like tentacles that enable the 
choker to strike from a distance. The creature's primary 
tactic is to grab a target around the throat and hold on 
until its prey is dead. 
CONJ_U_R_E_R ____ _

Charisma (spell save DC 13). It can innately cast the following 
spells, requiring no verbal or material components: 
At will: detect magic, disguise self, mage armor

succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or its hit point 
maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. 
This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The tar­
get dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. 
A humanoid slain by this attack rises 24 hours later as a zom­
bie under the wight's control, unless the humanoid is restored 
to life or its body is destroyed . The wight can have no more 
than twelve zombies under its control at one time. DREAD WARRIOR 
The Red Wizards (Dead in Thay) make use of several 
kinds of undead minions, including the special servants 
known as dread warriors. After being created by a se­
cret ritual, a dread warrior is further enchanted so that 
a Red Wizard can employ the creature in the fashion of 
a spellcaster's familiar. By creating a psychic link with a 
dread warrior, a Red Wizard can experience the world 
through the creature's senses and direct the warrior. 
Undead Nature. A dread warrior doesn't require air, 
food, drink, or sleep.

failed save, the attacker targets the creature closest to it, other 
than the enchanter or itself. If multiple creatures are closest,

EVOKER 
Evokers are specialist wizards who harness magical 
energy and elemental forces to destroy. Many tend to 
be hotheaded and aggressive. Others are cold and re­
served, unleashing their power at just the right moment 
to exploit an opponent's weakness.

GREATER ZOMBIE 
Many of those who brave the Tomb of Horrors believe

place and not attacked, it might provide visitors with a 
bit or two of possibly useful information. 
KELPIE 
A kelpie (White Plume Mountain) is a form of intelligent,

disguise is convincing, unless the kelpie is in bright light or the 
viewer is within 30 feet of it, in which case the seams between 
the seaweed strands are visible. The kelpie returns to its true 
form if takes a bonus action to do so or if it dies.

Hit: 11 (2d8 + 2) piercing damage. If the target is a Medium or 
smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 12). 
Drowning Hypnosis. The kelpie chooses one humanoid it can 
see within 150 feet of it. If the target can see the kelpie, the tar­
get must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be mag­
ically charmed while the kelpie maintains concentration, up to 
10 minutes (as if concentrating on a spell). 
The charmed target is incapacitated, and instead of holding 
its breath underwater, it tries to breathe normally and immedi­
ately runs out of breath, unless it can breathe water. 
If the charmed target is more than 5 feet away from the kel­
pie, the target must move on its turn toward the kelpie by the 
most direct route, trying to get within 5 feet. It doesn't avoid 
opportunity attacks. 
Before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, 
and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the 
kelpie or drowning, the target can repeat the saving throw. A 
charmed target can also repeat the saving throw at the end of 
each of its turns. If the saving throw is successful, the effect 
ends on it. 
A target that successfully saves is immune to this kelpie's 
hypnosis for the next 24 hours.

Quarterstaff. Melee Weapon Attack: +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one 
target. Hit: 2 (ld6-1) bludgeoning damage, or 3 (ld& -1) 
bludgeoning damage if used with two hands. VAMPIRIC MIST 
In a loose manner of speaking , the vampiric mist is the 
embodiment of the vampire's hunger for blood. It exists 
only to seek out creatures and drain the life from them, 
and its insubstantial nature enables it to pursue prey 
through the tiniest of openings. 
When first encountered , a vampiric mist appears as
a billowing mass of light clouds. As the creature feeds, 
its coloration darkens to a deep crimson. In the Temple 
of Blood inside the Doom vault (Dead in Thay), several 
clouds of vampiric mist appear and attempt to engulf 
any who don't escape the place quickly. 
Undead Nature. A vampiric mist doesn't require 
air or sleep.

Blood Sense. The vampiric mist can sense living creatures that 
have blood or similar vital fluids in a radius of 60 feet. 
Forbiddance. The vampiric mist can't enter a residence without 
an invitation from one of the occupants. 
Misty Form. The vampiric mist can occupy another creature's 
space and vice versa. In addition, if air can pass through a 
space, the mist can pass through it without squeezing . Each 
foot of movement in water costs it 2 extra feet, rather than l 
extra foot. The mist can't manipulate objects in any way that 
requires hands; it can apply simple force only. 
Sunlight Hypersensitivity. The vampiric mist takes 20 radiant 
damage when it starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, 
the mist has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. 
ACTIONS 
Blood Drain. One creature in the vampiric mist's space must 
make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw (undead and con­
structs automatically succeed). On a failed save, the target 
takes 10 (2d6 + 3) necrotic damage, its hit point maximum is 
reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and 
the mist regains hit points equal to that amount. 
This reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts until 
the target finishes a long rest. It dies if this effect reduces its hit 
point maximum to 0.

tive -1 penalty to the AC it offers. The armor is destroyed if the 
penalty reduces its AC to 10. 
APPENDIX B I CREATURES WHITE MAW 
In their laboratories inside the Doomvault (Dead in 
Thay), the Red Wizards experiment with a process to 
create sentient oozes. The creature they call White Maw 
is one of their early achievements-a gray ooze of enor­
mous size that has intelligence and can communicate. 
These talents are considerably diminished by the fact 
that the creature is utterly insane. 
Ooze Nature. White Maw doesn't require sleep. 
YUSDRAYL 
The kobolds that occupy a portion of the Sunless Citadel 
are not a combative lot, as long as they are not attacked . 
That attitude is shared by their leader, Yusdrayl. She 
is not automatically hostile to strangers who enter her 
throne room, and in fact is looking for some help from 
a group of outsiders that can help her contend with the 
goblins that live nearby. But if she or any other kobolds 
are threatened or set upon, Yusdrayl defends herself and 
her tribe as fiercely as she can.
