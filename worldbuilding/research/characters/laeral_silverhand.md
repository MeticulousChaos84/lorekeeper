## Overview

Laeral Silverhand serves as the Open Lord of Waterdeep in the current era (1490s DR), the public face and chief executive of the city's government. She is one of the legendary Seven Sisters—daughters of the goddess Mystra who serve as Chosen of the goddess of magic. Her appointment as Open Lord represents both her immense personal power and the trust Waterdeep's Masked Lords place in her judgment.

Laeral's life has been marked by great accomplishment and deep personal loss, including the death of her husband Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun and whatever fate befell her children.

## Key Information

### Titles and Roles

- **Open Lord of Waterdeep** - Public ruler of the city
- **Chosen of Mystra** - Bearer of divine magical power
- **One of the Seven Sisters** - Legendary group of Mystra's daughters
- **Widow of Khelben Arunsun** - Former wife of the Blackstaff

### The Seven Sisters

Laeral is one of seven sisters who are all Chosen of Mystra. These legendary figures have shaped the history of Faerûn for centuries. The other sisters include:
- The Simbul (Witch-Queen of Aglarond)
- Storm Silverhand
- Dove Falconhand
- And others

The available sources don't detail all seven, but they are referenced as a famous group that Laeral rarely discusses.

### Governance of Waterdeep

As Open Lord, Laeral:
- Serves as the public face of Waterdeep's government
- Works with the Masked Lords (anonymous rulers) to govern
- Maintains the city's laws and order
- Mobilizes Force Grey when needed
- Uses spies to monitor adventurers and potential threats

> "Waterdeep's Open Lord, Laeral Silverhand, uses spies to keep tabs on adventurers in the city, rewarding those who place Waterdeep's interests above their own." — Waterdeep: Dragon Heist

She employs agents such as Jalester Silvermane and uses the Lords' Alliance to extend her influence beyond the city walls.

### Personal Grief

Laeral carries deep wounds from losses in her past. She refuses to discuss:
- Her children
- Her late husband Khelben
- Her famous sisters

> "The new Open Lord doesn't speak of her family—any mention of her children, her late husband (the fabled Blackstaff, Khelben Arunsun), or any of her famed sisters is cause for her to cut short whatever conversation may be in progress at the time." — Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

This reticence suggests profound grief or perhaps complicated relationships with her surviving sisters. The fate of her children is not detailed in the available sources.

### Relationship with Khelben

Laeral's marriage to Khelben Arunsun joined two of the most powerful archmages in Faerûn. When Khelben left the Harpers to found the Moonstars, Laeral departed with him:

> "Khelben and Laeral Silverhand, his wife, left the Harpers then, taking with them certain agents and folding them into to a different organization." — Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

Her current relationship with the Moonstars, now that Khelben has died and the organization has gone underground again, remains unclear.

### Relationship with the Current Blackstaff

Vajra Safahr now holds the title of Blackstaff, having inherited both the artifact and the position from Khelben. Laeral's relationship with her late husband's successor is not detailed in the sources, but presumably involves at least professional coordination given their respective roles in Waterdeep's defense.

### The Xanathar Factor

The beholder crime lord Xanathar fears Laeral and is inclined to spare those in her employ to avoid provoking conflict:

> "Xanathar has a healthy fear of Laeral Silverhand and is inclined to spare those in her employ, to avoid provoking a conflict with Waterdeep's Open Lord." — Waterdeep: Dragon Heist

This speaks to Laeral's reputation for power and her willingness to act decisively against threats to her city.

## Powers and Abilities

As a Chosen of Mystra, Laeral possesses:
- Extraordinary magical abilities
- Extended lifespan (centuries old)
- Connection to the goddess's divine essence
- Unknown additional powers specific to the Chosen

The specific nature of her magical abilities isn't detailed in the available sources, but her reputation is sufficient to intimidate a beholder crime lord.

## Political Position

### Lords' Alliance

Laeral works through the Lords' Alliance to coordinate with other Sword Coast cities. Waterdeep is one of the most influential members of this confederation.

### Relationship with Dagult Neverember

Lord Dagult Neverember was the previous Open Lord before being ousted. He embezzled half a million gold dragons from the city—the treasure that drives the plot of Waterdeep: Dragon Heist. Laeral's stance toward her predecessor is presumably negative given his crimes against the city.

## Contradictions & Notes

### The Silent Past

Laeral's refusal to discuss her past creates significant gaps in the available record. What happened to her children? What is her relationship with her sisters? Does she blame herself for anything? These questions remain unanswered.

### Moonstars Connection

The Moonstars "seemed to collapse" when Khelben died but later reactivated during the Sundering. Does Laeral have any connection to this revival? The sources note that her relationship to the present-day Moonstars "remains unclear."

### Power Level

While Laeral is clearly extraordinarily powerful—a Chosen of Mystra who intimidates Xanathar—the sources don't detail her specific capabilities or how she compares to other legendary figures like Elminster.

*Research Note: Laeral Silverhand occupies a position of tremendous importance in current Faerûnian politics, but the available sources focus on her role rather than her person. She emerges as a powerful, grieving woman who pours herself into her duties while refusing to engage with her painful past. A full character study would require the Seven Sisters novels and other dedicated sources.*
