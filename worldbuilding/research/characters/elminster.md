## Overview

Elminster Aumar, known universally as "the Sage of Shadowdale," stands as perhaps the most famous archmage in all Faerûn. He is a Chosen of Mystra—one of those rare mortals blessed (or burdened) with a portion of the goddess of magic's divine power—and has played a pivotal role in shaping the Realms across multiple ages.

His influence extends far beyond mere magical might. Elminster serves as a chronicler, advisor to kings and commoners alike, and a guiding force behind organizations such as the Harpers. He maintains an ongoing tradition of finding his way through portals between Faerûn and other worlds, including, according to Ed Greenwood, our own reality.

## Key Information

### Role and Status

- **Title:** The Sage of Shadowdale
- **Status:** Chosen of Mystra
- **Residence:** Shadowdale (Dalelands)
- **Alignment:** Commonly portrayed as Chaotic Good

### Core Mission

Like all Chosen of Mystra and the Servants (Magerobes/Mystwardens), Elminster travels the Realms:
- Instructing creatures in the use of magic
- Leaving spell scrolls, workbooks, and spellbooks to be found
- Distributing magic items for novices of the Art to discover

> "Like the Chosen of Mystra who are so infamous in tavern tales and legends, her Servants travel the Realms instructing creatures in the use of magic, and leaving spell scrolls, workbooks (simple spellbooks), and even magic items to be found." — Elminster's Forgotten Realms, Page 159

### Personality

Elminster's personality emerges through Ed Greenwood's writings as:
- **Sardonic and opinionated** - particularly regarding other chroniclers like Volo
- **Pedagogical** - delights in teaching and sharing lore
- **Cagey** - carefully omits dangerous secrets even while appearing forthcoming
- **Meddlesome** - habitually involves himself in the affairs of the Realms

> "You should hear Elminster when he goes on about Volo!" — Ed Greenwood, Elminster's Forgotten Realms

### Relationships

**Mystra (Goddess of Magic)**
- Serves as her Chosen, bearing a portion of her divine essence
- Acts as her agent in the mortal world
- Their relationship spans multiple incarnations of the goddess

**Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun**
- Fellow archmage and ally
- Both counted among Manshoon's most hated rivals
- Collaborated on matters of magical preservation and defense

**The Harpers**
- Founding member or early supporter
- Works through the organization to guide events
- Maintains connections to Harper leaders like Remallia Haventree

**Manshoon (Zhentarim)**
- Longtime enemy
- Manshoon challenged his magelings to "prove themselves by slaying Elminster" as a test

> "Manshoon kept the ranks in flux by challenging magelings (ambitious young wizards) to prove themselves by slaying Elminster or completing similarly deadly tasks." — Elminster's Forgotten Realms, Page 71

**Szass Tam (Thay)**
- Another of Manshoon's "most hated rivals" alongside Elminster and Khelben
- Represents the rival magical tradition of Thay

### Wisdom and Philosophy

On the gods and mortality:
> "As the Sage of Shadowdale once noted, 'If the gods can grant the power to raise mortals from death, why do ye assume they should be laid low by it forever?'" — Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

On adventurers and rulership:
> "Elminster once described it [politics] as the endless great game... of trying to advance the influence and aims of this deity and thwart or lessen the influence and aims of that one, so as to tug the Realms closer to what you personally want it to be." — Elminster's Forgotten Realms

### Known Associations

**The Knights of Myth Drannor**
- Adventuring company connected to Elminster
- Based in the Dalelands near his residence
- Frequently targeted Zhentarim operatives

**Ed Greenwood's Home Campaign**
- Elminster serves as the narrator/frame device for much Realms lore
- Represents the connection between Greenwood's creation and its gaming audience

## Role in Published Lore

Elminster serves a unique meta-textual function in Forgotten Realms publications:

1. **Narrator** - Many sourcebooks are presented as his writings or dictations
2. **Commentator** - Provides marginalia and corrections to other works
3. **Bridge Character** - Connects different eras and storylines
4. **Lore Authority** - His statements carry weight as "canon"

## Contradictions & Notes

### The Elminster Paradox

Despite being the most famous character in the Realms, biographical details about Elminster are surprisingly sparse in the available sources. "Elminster's Forgotten Realms" (2012) is not a biography of Elminster but rather a worldbuilding guide presented *from his perspective*—he narrates lore about daily life, laws, food, and culture rather than discussing his own history.

### Age and Timeline

The sources reference Elminster across a vast span of history but don't provide clear birth dates or age. He is ancient—old enough to remember multiple incarnations of Mystra—but specific chronology requires sources beyond those available in this collection.

### The Chosen Question

The exact nature of being a "Chosen of Mystra" varies between editions and sources. What powers and responsibilities this confers on Elminster specifically requires further research.

## Further Research Needed

- **Complete biography** - Birth, early life, major events, timeline
- **The Seven Sisters** - Elminster's relationship to these other Chosen
- **Simbul/Alassra** - Romantic relationship mentioned in other sources
- **Specific spells** - Spells Elminster created or is known for
- **Ed Greenwood novels** - The "Elminster" novel series would provide detailed biography
- **Current status** - His state as of the 1490s DR period
- **Shadowdale location** - Details of his tower and residence

*Research Note: The available sources treat Elminster more as a narrative device and authority figure than as a character to be examined. A complete profile would require the novel series and other dedicated biographical sources. What emerges here is his role, relationships, and voice rather than a traditional character study.*
