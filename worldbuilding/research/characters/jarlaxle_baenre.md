## Overview

Jarlaxle Baenre is a drow mercenary, swashbuckler, and mastermind who leads Bregan D'aerthe—a company of drow outcasts and mercenaries. Despite his heritage as a dark elf, Jarlaxle operates extensively in surface world politics and commerce. He is the secret lord of Luskan, the City of Sails, and runs legitimate business enterprises as cover for his operations.

In Waterdeep: Dragon Heist, Jarlaxle serves as one of the potential main villains, seeking to use the cache of dragons to buy his way into the Lords' Alliance.

## Key Information

### Titles and Roles

- **Leader of Bregan D'aerthe** - Commands the drow mercenary company
- **Secret Lord of Luskan** - Rules the City of Sails from the shadows
- **Zardoz Zord** - His human disguise in Waterdeep
- **Captain of the Eyecatcher** - His flagship

### The Bregan D'aerthe

Bregan D'aerthe is a company of mercenaries originally formed from outcast drow—the "much-derided and dishonorable castaways of destroyed drow houses."

**Membership:**
- Almost all members are male drow (females rarely accept male leadership)
- Female drow can join by denouncing drow matriarchy
- Non-drow operatives work for the organization without knowing they serve Jarlaxle

**Philosophy:**
Loyalty is what matters most to Jarlaxle. He is always looking for new members to fill the ranks.

### The Sea Maidens Faire

In Waterdeep, Bregan D'aerthe operates through a legitimate front: the Sea Maidens Faire, a traveling carnival.

**The Fleet:**
- **Eyecatcher** - Jarlaxle's flagship
- **Heartbreaker**
- **Hellraiser**

**Crew and Cargo:**
- Ships are crewed by disguised drow
- Non-drow performers (musicians, acrobats, actors)
- Wagons and floats for parades

> "The drow use these parades to draw attention away from their illicit activities." — Waterdeep: Dragon Heist

**The Scarlet Marpenoth:**
A submarine mounted underneath the Eyecatcher—Jarlaxle's secret weapon and escape route.

### Personality

**The Showman:**
Jarlaxle delights in theatrical presentation. His carnival cover is no accident—he genuinely enjoys spectacle and performance.

**The Schemer Who Enjoys the Game:**
> "Jarlaxle delights in thwarting his enemies, enjoys the complications that arise when adventurers try to meddle in his affairs, and loves to see the looks on their faces when he finally gets the better of them." — Waterdeep: Dragon Heist

**The Swift Enforcer:**
Despite his playfulness, Jarlaxle is ruthless when threatened:
> "He doesn't suffer fools who threaten him, however. If forced into a violent confrontation, he swiftly and brutally kills someone to make an example of them and then walks off." — Waterdeep: Dragon Heist

### Goals in Waterdeep

In the Dragon Heist adventure's autumn scenario:

**Primary Goal:** Use the cache of dragons (500,000 gold pieces) to buy his way into the Lords' Alliance.

**Secondary Goal:** Obtain the dragonstaff of Ahghairon for leverage in negotiations.

If Jarlaxle could legitimize Luskan through Lords' Alliance membership, he would transform his shadow lordship into recognized political power.

### The Zardoz Zord Disguise

To operate in Waterdeep, Jarlaxle uses magic to appear as a flamboyant Illuskan sea captain named Zardoz Zord. This persona:
- Commands the Sea Maidens Faire publicly
- Interacts with Waterdeep authorities
- Allows Jarlaxle to move freely in daylight

### Key Lieutenants

Jarlaxle relies on three drow gunslingers for dirty work in Waterdeep:
- **Fel'rekt Lafeen**
- **Krebbyg Masq'il'yr**
- **Soluun Xibrindas**

### Intelligence Operations

Bregan D'aerthe excels at infiltration. Notably:
- **Nar'l Xibrindas** - Xanathar's drow advisor is actually a Bregan D'aerthe spy

This demonstrates Jarlaxle's reach: he has agents even in the inner circle of the beholder crime lord.

- Baenre: BANE-ray

## Contradictions & Notes

### Villain or Ally?

Jarlaxle occupies an unusual position as a villain who can become an ally. He's not evil in the sense of wanting destruction—he wants power, wealth, and recognition. Adventurers who align their interests with his might find him helpful, while those who oppose him will find him a dangerous foe.

### The Lords' Alliance Goal

Jarlaxle's desire to join the Lords' Alliance through legitimate means (bribery aside) suggests he's tired of shadow politics. He wants acknowledgment and formal power, not just hidden influence.

### Drow Exceptionalism

Jarlaxle represents a path for drow who reject Lolth and drow society. His success suggests that the evil reputation of drow is cultural rather than inherent—though his methods remain morally questionable.

*Research Note: Jarlaxle is one of the most popular recurring characters in Forgotten Realms fiction, appearing extensively in R.A. Salvatore's novels. The available sourcebook material presents him primarily as a potential villain/ally, but the novels would reveal much more about his personality, history, and relationships. His charm, intelligence, and moral complexity make him a standout character.*
