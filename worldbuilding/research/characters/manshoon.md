## Overview

Manshoon is the founder of the Zhentarim (also known as the Black Network) and one of the most dangerous wizards in the history of Faerûn. His defining characteristics are his ruthless ambition, his use of stasis clones to achieve effective immortality, and his partnership with the god Bane. The "Manshoon Wars"—conflicts between multiple active clones—drove many of his most destructive actions, and at least one of his original clones still sleeps in hiding, awaiting the fall of all others.

In Waterdeep: Dragon Heist, a clone of Manshoon serves as one of the potential main villains, seeking to rule Waterdeep through bribery and manipulation.

## Key Information

### Core Ambition

Manshoon's ultimate goal was never mere political power. His true ambition:

> "More than aught else, Manshoon desired to increase his personal magical might so he could dominate wizards and sorcerers. He considered mighty wielders of the Art as superior beings to the 'common cattle' of humanity. To rule them is to rule the best—and thus to be the best." — Elminster's Forgotten Realms

He viewed himself as destined to become "the greatest, most famous wizard ever."

### The Zhentarim's True Purpose

While the Zhentarim engaged in conquest, espionage, and crime, Manshoon created the organization primarily to fund his magical research:

> "To do that, he would need great wealth to afford all he wanted for spell crafting. He preferred not to suffer the endless interruptions and perils of hiring out his magic to others to raise funds." — Elminster's Forgotten Realms

The central goal he set for the Zhentarim: "to establish the shortest trade route linking the Moonsea with the rich markets of the Sword Coast lands."

### Family and Early Career

Manshoon began his rise to power by backing his older brother Asmuth:

> "Manshoon began his quest for power by backing up his older, louder, far less subtle older brother, the warrior Asmuth. Foreseeing a long, bloody, and probably losing battle if Asmuth tried to violently forge the strongest faction among many in Zhentil Keep, Manshoon decided on another road." — Elminster's Forgotten Realms

He allied with Lord Chess, cultivated wealthy merchants and lords, and secretly made common cause with beholders who had come to dominate the local church of Bane.

### Alliance with Bane

To protect himself from interference by Mystra and Azuth, Manshoon sought the personal patronage of Bane, god of tyranny:

> "To guard against Mystra and Azuth foiling his ambitions with their dictates, Manshoon sought the personal patronage of Bane, and won it. Though his fortunes have risen and fallen with Bane's, ever since, the two have aided each other effectively." — Elminster's Forgotten Realms

This partnership has been mutually beneficial:
- Bane's return was "rooted in creatures readied by Manshoon's magic"
- In gratitude, Bane "has rescued Manshoon time and time again"

### The Stasis Clones

Manshoon's most significant magical achievement is his use of stasis clones for effective immortality:

> "With the aid of his notorious stasis clones—at least a dozen of which still survive, scattered across other worlds and dimensions—Manshoon intended to outlast those foes he couldn't outwit or destroy." — Elminster's Forgotten Realms

### The Manshoon Wars

When multiple clones became active simultaneously, they went insane:

> "All those [accounts of angry, fearful, or reckless behavior] from the later 1400s DR are due to the insanity aroused in Manshoon clones when multiple are awake and active at the same time. What some sages have called 'the Manshoon Wars' did not span just the few wild years most believe to be the case, but lasted for more than a century." — Elminster's Forgotten Realms

During this period:
- A Manshoon clone ruled Westgate as "Orbakh the vampire" and headed the Night Masks
- Other clones were active elsewhere in Faerûn
- Every clone was "less than sane, and acting accordingly"

### The Most Dangerous Clone

The earliest clones, paradoxically, are the most dangerous:

> "Manshoon's earliest and least powerful surviving clones are more dangerous than his later, more magically accomplished selves. This is true because the early clones retain more of his calm, cold calculation, his freedom from loving or holding anyone in friendship, his clearest and most ruthless thinking . . . and his fiercest ambition." — Elminster's Forgotten Realms

At least one early clone foresaw the Manshoon Wars and hid itself in stasis within multiple ward spells:

> "That clone still sleeps in hiding, and will emerge after all other Manshoons have fallen." — Elminster's Forgotten Realms

## Leadership Style

### Testing Through Danger

Manshoon used deadly assignments to test and cull his followers:

> "Manshoon kept the ranks in flux by challenging magelings (ambitious young wizards) to prove themselves by slaying Elminster or completing similarly deadly tasks." — Elminster's Forgotten Realms

### Strategic Patience

He preferred to wear down enemies through repeated harassment rather than decisive confrontation:

> "They heeded Manshoon's orders to harry enemies through repeated fighting, wearing them down rather than doing anything overly risky or heroic in trying to destroy all foes as swiftly and decisively as possible." — Elminster's Forgotten Realms

### Secrecy Above All

"Getting the word out right away" about any attack or event was "a firm, standing order from Manshoon." After examples were made of Zhents who failed to report promptly, no one dared delay.

## Rivalries

### The Three Rivals

Manshoon's "most hated rivals" were:
1. **Szass Tam** - Zulkir of Necromancy in Thay
2. **Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun** - Archmage of Waterdeep
3. **Elminster Aumar** - Sage of Shadowdale

This trio represented the major independent magical powers opposing his ambitions.

### Mellowing With Age

> "The older Manshoon was increasingly tempered by life, as his most hated rivals Szass Tam, Khelben 'Blackstaff' Arunsun, and Elminster Aumar all were. He was mellowing, and starting to feel and pursue other interests aside from the drive for ever more powerful Art." — Elminster's Forgotten Realms

This mellowing, however, did not apply to his earlier clones.

## In Waterdeep: Dragon Heist

In the adventure's winter scenario, a Manshoon clone serves as the main villain:

### Goals
- Rule Waterdeep by bribing the Masked Lords
- Regain control of the Black Network
- Claim the cache of dragons (500,000 gold pieces)

### Location
He lurks in Kolat Towers, a pair of wizards' towers in the Trades Ward.

### Methods
- Creates copies of himself using the *simulacrum* spell
- Takes great pains to conceal his identity
- Avoids unnecessary confrontations

> "Manshoon avoids unnecessary confrontations with adventurers; only those who enter his extradimensional sanctum are likely to incur his wrath." — Waterdeep: Dragon Heist

### Pronunciation

The official pronunciation is: man-SHOON

## Contradictions & Notes

### The Clone Question

Which Manshoon is "the real Manshoon"? The sources suggest they all are—each clone contains the original's memories and personality (though early clones are more purely ruthless). This creates a philosophical puzzle about identity and continuity of self.

### Evil vs. Intelligent

Manshoon is unambiguously evil but also genuinely intelligent and strategic. He built an organization that has outlasted him (in his original form), created magical contingencies that have preserved his existence across centuries, and earned the personal patronage of a god. Underestimating him is dangerous.

### The Fzoul Factor

Fzoul Chembryl eventually took over day-to-day leadership of the Zhentarim, which led to the organization becoming less effective:

> "Later, under Fzoul Chembryl, the Zhents started to try to accomplish all sorts of things at once, and although they seemed everywhere and more powerful, they became far less effective at actually finishing anything they set out to do." — Elminster's Forgotten Realms

## Further Research Needed

- **Complete timeline** - Birth, original death, clone activations
- **Specific spells** - What magic has Manshoon created or mastered?
- **Current status** - How many clones remain active?
- **Westgate period** - Details of his rule as Orbakh
- **Relationship with Fzoul** - How did this partnership function?
- **Novel sources** - The Manshoon novels would provide detail

*Research Note: Manshoon is one of the most thoroughly documented villains in the available sources, with extensive information about his psychology, goals, methods, and history. He represents the archetype of the intelligent, patient, long-lived villain—someone who builds systems rather than merely accumulating personal power. The existence of his hidden "sleeper" clone suggests that even killing all known Manshoons would not end his threat.*
