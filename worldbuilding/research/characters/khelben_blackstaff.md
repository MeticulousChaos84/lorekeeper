## Overview

Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun was one of the most powerful and influential archmages in the history of Waterdeep. His epithet derived from his signature magic item, the Blackstaff—a powerful artifact that has since passed to his successors in the role of Blackstaff of Waterdeep. Khelben served as a guardian of the city, a leader among the Harpers, and later the founder of a controversial splinter organization called the Moonstars.

Though Khelben has died, his legacy persists through the office of the Blackstaff, currently held by Vajra Safahr, and through organizations he influenced during his long life.

## Key Information

### Titles and Roles

- **The Blackstaff** - Archmage of Waterdeep
- **Harper Leader** - High-ranking member before his departure
- **Founder of the Moonstars** - Led the Tel'Teukiira
- **Consort to a Chosen** - Married to Laeral Silverhand

### Status

**Deceased** - Khelben died at some point before the current era (1490s DR). The exact date and circumstances of his death are not detailed in the available sources, though it is mentioned that his death appeared to cause the Moonstars to collapse.

### Marriage to Laeral Silverhand

Khelben was married to Laeral Silverhand, one of the Seven Sisters and a Chosen of Mystra. Their partnership was both romantic and professional—when Khelben left the Harpers to form the Moonstars, Laeral departed with him.

Laeral has since become the Open Lord of Waterdeep, though she rarely speaks of Khelben:

> "The new Open Lord doesn't speak of her family—any mention of her children, her late husband (the fabled Blackstaff, Khelben Arunsun), or any of her famed sisters is cause for her to cut short whatever conversation may be in progress at the time." — Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

### The Harper Schism

Khelben's most controversial act was his decision to empower Fzoul Chembryl, the evil leader of the Zhentarim, with a powerful artifact. Though Khelben did this to enable Fzoul to destroy a dangerous lich—a greater evil—his fellow Harper leaders denounced him for it.

> "Over a century ago, the Harpers endured a schism. Khelben 'Blackstaff' Arunsun was denounced by other Harper leaders for empowering Fzoul Chembryl, then the evil leader of the Zhentarim, with a powerful artifact. That Khelben did so in order that Fzoul destroy a dangerous lich mattered little." — Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

This event reveals Khelben's fundamental philosophy: he was willing to make morally ambiguous—even morally repugnant—choices if he believed the outcome served a greater good. This pragmatism set him apart from more idealistic Harper leaders.

### The Moonstars (Tel'Teukiira)

After leaving the Harpers, Khelben and Laeral founded the Moonstars, an organization Khelben had been "secretly working to create for some time due to an old prophecy of the elves of Cormanthor."

**Organization Characteristics:**
- Elvish name: Tel'Teukiira
- More pragmatic and brutal than the Harpers
- Included members the Harpers considered "too evil"
- Notably included a vampire among its membership
- Worked both with and against the Harpers depending on circumstances

> "Although the Moonstars worked in concert at times with the Harpers, they also worked at cross purposes, and the Moonstars membership included many whom the Harpers considered too evil, such as a vampire. The Moonstars performed many good deeds, but their methods were often more brutal and pragmatic than the Harpers' lofty ideals allowed." — Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

**Apparent Collapse and Revival:**

> "When Khelben died, the Moonstars seemed to collapse, and for many years the organization was assumed defunct. Yet during the Sundering, Moonstar sleeper agents reactivated the organization on a surprisingly massive scale, with members active in Candlekeep, Waterdeep, and Myth Drannor." — Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

The organization has since gone underground again, and its current relationship to the Harpers, Laeral Silverhand, and the current Blackstaff (Vajra) remains unclear.

### Connections to Mystra

Khelben served at the direct order of the goddess Mystra herself on at least one occasion—hiding The Book of Dragons to prevent it from falling into dangerous hands:

> "The Book of Dragons was hidden by Khelben 'Blackstaff' Arunsun at the direct order of the goddess Mystra herself." — Elminster's Forgotten Realms

### Rivalry with Manshoon

Khelben was counted among Manshoon's "most hated rivals," alongside Szass Tam of Thay and Elminster himself:

> "The older Manshoon was increasingly tempered by life, as his most hated rivals Szass Tam, Khelben 'Blackstaff' Arunsun, and Elminster Aumar all were." — Elminster's Forgotten Realms

This places Khelben among the most powerful and influential wizards of his age—the three archmages whom the founder of the Zhentarim considered his primary opposition.

## The Blackstaff Legacy

### The Artifact

The Blackstaff itself is a powerful magical artifact that serves both as a weapon and a symbol of office. The current wielder, Vajra Safahr, inherited both the artifact and the title.

### The Office

The Blackstaff of Waterdeep serves as:
- Overseer of the Gray Hands (adventurer organization)
- Commander of Force Grey (elite adventurer cadre)
- Advisor on magical matters to Waterdeep's government
- Guardian of the city against magical threats

The current Blackstaff, Vajra Safahr, continues to fulfill these duties, though her relationship to Khelben's Moonstars remains unclear.

## Contradictions & Notes

### The Book of Dragons

The sources mention that Khelben hid The Book of Dragons at Mystra's order, but don't explain why he was chosen for this task or what his relationship to the artifact was before hiding it. The book has since been stolen by a dragon and incorporated into its hoard.

### Pragmatism vs. Evil

Khelben's willingness to work with evil entities for the greater good raises questions about his alignment and philosophy. Was he truly good, or did his ends-justify-means approach make him something more complex? The sources suggest the latter—he was good in intention but not always in method.

### The Elven Prophecy

The sources mention that Khelben created the Moonstars "due to an old prophecy of the elves of Cormanthor," but don't elaborate on what this prophecy was or how the Moonstars were supposed to fulfill it.

## Further Research Needed

*Research Note: Khelben appears in the available sources primarily through his organizational roles and relationships rather than through detailed personal history. His character emerges as a pragmatic, powerful wizard willing to take morally complex actions for strategic goals—a stark contrast to more idealistic archmages. A complete profile would require the Waterdeep novel series and other dedicated sources.*
