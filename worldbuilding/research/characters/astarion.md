## Overview

Astarion Ancunín is an elf vampire spawn who gained widespread recognition through Baldur's Gate 3, where he serves as both adventuring companion and potential romantic interest. Prior to the game's events, he spent nearly two centuries as the unwilling servant of the vampire Cazador Szarr, a worshiper of the archdevil Mephistopheles.

The name "Ancunín" suggests elvish noble lineage, and indeed Astarion served as a magistrate in Baldur's Gate before his turning—a position of considerable authority that makes his subsequent enslavement all the more tragic.

## Key Information

### Timeline

| Year (DR) | Event |
|-----------|-------|
| 1261 | Astarion Ancunín is born in Baldur's Gate |
| 1300 | Cazador Szarr turns Astarion into a vampire spawn |
| 1492 | The events of Baldur's Gate 3 occur |
| 1501 | Events of Forgotten Realms: Heroes of Faerûn and Adventures in Faerûn |

**Note:** This makes Astarion approximately 39 years old when turned, and roughly 231 years old (in total existence) during the events of BG3. He spent 192 years as Cazador's spawn.

### Pre-Vampiric Life

Before his transformation, Astarion was:
- An **elf magistrate** in Baldur's Gate
- Born and raised in the city
- Presumably possessed considerable social standing

The supplement does not elaborate on the circumstances of his turning, though his position as magistrate may have made him a particularly appealing target for Cazador—corrupting an agent of the law into a predator being especially perverse.

### Life Under Cazador

As Cazador's **second spawn** (preceded only by Aurelia), Astarion occupied a position of some seniority in the "family," though this granted him no protection from his master's cruelty.

His nightly duties consisted of:
- Hunting the streets of Baldur's Gate
- Luring victims to Cazador's palace
- Delivering these unfortunates to be fed upon and killed

To cope with Szarr's torments and the horrors of his undead existence, Astarion developed distinctive psychological defenses:
- **Sardonic wit** - Sharp, cutting humor
- **Flirtation** - Using charm as both weapon and shield
- **Dark sense of humor** - Finding amusement in the macabre

### Hunting Grounds

Astarion favored **Rat's Run**, a disreputable tavern and inn near Gray Harbor in the Seatower neighborhood of Baldur's Gate. The establishment's particular appeal:

> "Astarion has frequented several seedy establishments during his time in Baldur's Gate, but the inn and tavern called Rat's Run was one of his favorite hunting grounds. Here, he hunted undetected, blending into the crowds of inebriated patrons and luring victims into darkened alleys." — Page 52

The tavern's criminal clientele meant disappearances went uninvestigated—perfect for a vampire spawn who needed to remain undetected.

### Relationships

**Cazador Szarr (Master)**
- Relationship characterized by torment and unwilling servitude
- Cazador worships Mephistopheles and is a vampire infernalist
- The master-spawn bond is one of control and cruelty

**Violet (Sibling Rivalry)**
- Fourth spawn in Cazador's family
- Actively plots Astarion's destruction
- Described as relishing "tormenting her siblings" and striving to please Cazador

> "Ever since she crawled out of her grave, my sniveling sister Violet has been murderously jealous of me. She thinks I want to humiliate her at every turn. It's laughable, but if she won't leave me be, I'll need to dig her a deeper grave—this time, one she'll never leave." — Astarion, Sibling Rival

**Roka Glimmerbeak**
- Kenku agent for the Guild
- Described as "friendly" with Astarion
- Occasionally designates targets for elimination that Astarion then hunts

**Other Spawn**
- Aurelia (first spawn) - Tiefling, calm surface concealing secrets
- Pale Petras (third spawn) - Human, known for arrogance and stubbornness
- Dalyria - Elf, former physician general, seeks to reverse her vampirism
- Leon - Most recent spawn, desperate to protect his daughter Victoria
- Antwun Dufay - Human, Cazador's trusted chamberlain
- Yousen - Gnome, Small-sized hunter

### Personality

Astarion's voice throughout the supplement reveals a complex personality:

**The Charmer**
> "I charmed her, using all the old-fashioned techniques: the honeyed voice, the cocked brow, the hip swivel. And then I smiled, and the hunter glimpsed my fangs." — Introduction

**The Social Commentator**
> "It may seem terrible, but I assure you, my family engages in no more devil worshiping or murder than any other upstanding noble clan in Baldur's Gate. And at least our dinner guests have a screaming good time." — On his family

**The Sommelier**
> "The streets at night teem with all types: the misguided, the oblivious, the depraved. And then there are the drunken louts, the world-weary lovers, and the harried survivors. I like to think of them each as a unique vintage." — Nocturnal Sommelier

**The Self-Aware Predator**
> "Behind the closed doors of the main hall's private booths, you'd be shocked how easily I can entice fools into wandering home with me. I always promise they'll experience the feast of a lifetime—and I always deliver." — Morbid Maître D'

**The Multitalented**
> "You might ask: Are these tricks best for fighting or for seduction? I say, my darlings, why not both?" — The Multitalented

### The Book's Purpose

Notably, Astarion authored this supplement himself (in-universe), sharing vampiric secrets with a vampire hunter he encountered at Rat's Run. His stated motivations:

1. Self-preservation - helping hunters eliminate vampires who might threaten him
2. Entertainment - finding amusement in the potential consequences
3. Vanity - believing his words deserve to "echo in the hearts and minds of vampire hunters for generations"

His targets for elimination:
> "Gods be praised, we might finally be rid of the worst of our kind: the indiscreet, the devil worshipers, the demon harbingers, and the boring!"

This reveals both his pragmatism and his contempt for vampires who lack his refinement—particularly ironic given his own master's devil worship.

## Game Statistics

As presented in the adventure hooks, Astarion uses the **Vampire Spawn** stat block and is Medium-sized.

## Adventures Involving Astarion

The supplement presents two adventures centered on Astarion:

### Family Outreach (Level 3)
- Violet attempts to have Astarion killed at Rat's Run
- Involves the Bloody Knives gang, Fiendish Icons, and Harvester Devils
- Reward: 150 GP per character plus a future favor

### The Wayward Son (Level 12)
- Cazador himself comes to capture and punish Astarion
- Involves Vampire Wardens, Speaker Devils, and Cazador (Vampire Infernalist)
- Reward: Manual of Gainful Exercise plus 4,700 bonus XP

## Contradictions & Notes

### Moral Ambiguity
The supplement explicitly states characters "needn't be wicked, but law-abiding citizens might find their ethics challenged" by adventures involving Astarion. He offers payment and favors but is, fundamentally, a predator who has murdered innocents for two centuries.

### The Irony of the Book
Astarion acknowledges the "delicious irony" of a vampire sharing secrets that could be used to kill vampires. This self-awareness is characteristic—he understands exactly what he is while maintaining distance through humor.

### Canon Flexibility
The supplement allows Astarion to be urged toward "redemption or tyranny" in BG3, meaning his ultimate fate remains player-determined. The 1501 DR dating suggests canon continues regardless of player choice.

## Further Research Needed

- **Pre-turning history** - What cases did he adjudicate as magistrate? How did Cazador target him?
- **The turning itself** - Circumstances of how Cazador captured and turned him
- **Relationship with other spawn** - Dynamics beyond Violet's antagonism
- **Cazador's ultimate fate** - The supplement focuses on pre-BG3 events
- **Astarion's current status** - What becomes of him in the 1501 DR timeframe?
