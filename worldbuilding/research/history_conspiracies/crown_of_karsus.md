## Overview

The Crown of Karsus is an artifact connected to the archwizard Karsus who destroyed Netheril with his attempt to steal divine power. However, **no references to this specific artifact appear in the available source texts**.

---

## Available Context

### Karsus Himself

From the TSR Netheril Expansion, we know:

- Karsus was born in 3163 NY
- He created and cast the only 12th-level spell ever, *Karsus's Avatar*
- His attempt to steal Mystryl's power caused the Fall of Netheril
- His body was petrified and fell to earth, where it was later worshipped as a dying god
- The city of Karse was built around his stone corpse

### Possible Nature of the Crown

Given Karsus's history, the Crown could be:
- An artifact worn during the casting of Karsus's Avatar
- A relic recovered from his petrified remains
- A later creation designed to channel residual power from his corpse
- A symbolic item created by the worshippers at Karse

## Research Gap

This artifact does not appear in:
- TSR 1147 AD&D 2nd Edition Netheril Expansion
- Netheril Empire of Magic Box Set
- Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide
- Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide
- Any other available source texts

This suggests the Crown of Karsus may be:
1. Content from Baldur's Gate 3 or other video game sources
2. Referenced in sourcebooks not currently available in this archive
3. A later addition to Forgotten Realms lore (post-5th edition sources)

## Further Research Needed

To complete this entry, investigate:
- Baldur's Gate 3 game content and official companion materials
- Post-2014 Forgotten Realms sourcebooks
- Official D&D adventure modules set in the Sword Coast region
- Organized play materials that may reference Netherese artifacts
