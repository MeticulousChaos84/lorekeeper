## Overview

The Chosen Three refers to **Gortash, Orin, and Ketheric**—three individuals who serve as the primary agents of the Absolute conspiracy. These characters appear to be specific to Baldur's Gate 3 content, and **detailed information about them is not available in the current source texts**.

A grep search for these names returned only one result: "Baldur's Gate Descent into Avernus.txt" - however, this source could not be fully accessed for extraction.

## The Dead Three Context

The Chosen Three appear to be empowered by the **Dead Three**—Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul—who are extensively documented in Forgotten Realms sources:

### Bane (Lord of Darkness)
- God of tyranny and fear
- One of the three gods who rose to power by slaying the previous god Jergal
- His worship emphasizes control and domination

### Bhaal (Lord of Murder)
- God of murder and assassination
- Rose alongside Bane and Myrkul
- Killed during the Time of Troubles but reborn in 1482 DR

From the Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide:
> "The first indication of new turmoil came in 1482 DR, when Bhaal, the long-dead god of murder, was reborn."

### Myrkul (Lord of Bones)
- God of death and decay
- The third of the three mortals who ascended by taking Jergal's portfolios

## Theoretical Role Structure

Based on the Dead Three's portfolios, the Chosen Three likely serve as:

1. **Gortash** - Champion of Bane (Tyranny/Control)
   - Likely represents political or military power
   - Focus on domination and structure

2. **Orin** - Champion of Bhaal (Murder)
   - Likely represents assassination and violence
   - Focus on eliminating enemies

3. **Ketheric** - Champion of Myrkul (Death)
   - Likely represents undeath or necromancy
   - Focus on the dead and dying

Each would serve the hidden Elder Brain while believing they serve their respective god.

## Connection to The Absolute

The Chosen Three appear to be:
- Public faces of the Absolute cult
- Empowered by their patron god among the Dead Three
- Unknowingly serving an Elder Brain's agenda
- Competing with each other for ultimate control

This structure creates a conspiracy within a conspiracy—the Dead Three believe they are using the Elder Brain, while the Elder Brain believes it is using them.
