# The Absolute: The False God Conspiracy

**Sources:** *Limited references in available texts*

**Tags:** #absolute #conspiracy #illithid #elderbrain #bg3 #further_research

## Overview

The Absolute refers to a conspiracy involving a false deity cult that appears to be BG3-specific content. While the available sources contain extensive information on illithids and mind flayers, **direct references to "The Absolute" as a specific entity or conspiracy are not found in the available source texts**.

### Mind Flayers and Elder Brains

From the Spelljammer and other sources, we know mind flayers:
- Are aberrations from or shaped by the Far Realm
- Use nautiloids—ships "designed exclusively for space travel" that can plane shift
- Are associated with ceremorphosis (transformation process)
- Maintain Elder Brains as collective consciousness repositories

> "Aberrations such as mind flayers and beholders are either from this plane or shaped by its strange influence."
> — Dungeon Master's Guide

### Illithid Activities in the Realms

From Elminster's Forgotten Realms, mind flayers:
- Covertly seek out corrupt noble families
- Form initial alliances, then slowly take control
- Use humans as agents
- Are mentioned alongside doppelgangers and beholders as threats

## Theoretical Framework

Based on available lore, The Absolute conspiracy likely involves:

### Core Elements
1. **An Elder Brain** - The central intelligence behind the operation
2. **Illithid Tadpoles** - Mechanism for control through partial ceremorphosis
3. **A Cult Structure** - False religious worship providing cover
4. **Humanoid Agents** - Infected or controlled servants spreading influence

### The "Chosen" System
The conspiracy likely involves selected champions (see: [[the_chosen_three.md]]) who serve as public faces while the Elder Brain maintains hidden control.

### Goals
Based on illithid lore, probable objectives:
- Mass ceremorphosis to expand illithid numbers
- Control of surface populations
- Acquisition of magical power or artifacts
- Revenge or resurgence of an ancient illithid empire

## Research Gap

The Absolute is not directly referenced in:
- TSR sourcebooks
- Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide
- Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide
- Spelljammer materials
- Any other available source texts

This content appears specific to:
1. **Baldur's Gate 3** - The video game's central plot
2. Related companion materials and tie-in sourcebooks

## The Dead Three Connection

The Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide mentions Bhaal's rebirth in 1482 DR during the Second Sundering, which may connect to the Absolute conspiracy's use of the Dead Three (Bane, Bhaal, Myrkul) as a theological framework.

## Further Research Needed

To complete this entry, investigate:
- Baldur's Gate 3 game content and lore documents
- Official tie-in materials for BG3
- Any official D&D sourcebooks released alongside or after BG3
- The Murder in Baldur's Gate adventure module (potential earlier references)
