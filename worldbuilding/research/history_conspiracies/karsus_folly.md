## Overview

In a single moment of hubris, the archwizard Karsus attempted to steal the power of a god—and in doing so, destroyed the greatest magical civilization the world had ever known. The event known as Karsus's Folly or simply "The Fall" occurred in **3520 NY** and serves as the defining cautionary tale about magical ambition in Faerûnian history.

More than merely destroying Netheril, Karsus's spell fundamentally altered how magic functions in the Realms. The goddess he stole power from—Mystryl—was forced to sacrifice herself to save the Weave, and her successor Mystra ensured that no spell above 10th level would ever function again.

## The Architect of Catastrophe: Karsus

### Early Life

Karsus was born in **3163 NY**, at the beginning of the Shadowed Age. He displayed unprecedented magical talent:

> "Karsus's first spellcasting came at the tender age of two, when he instinctively cast a cantra. Young Karsus found himself learning spells almost inherently, as though he always knew them."
> — TSR Netheril Expansion

### Religious Training and Rejection

The priesthood of Mystryl recognized his potential and trained him, attempting to bring him into their hierarchy. He refused:

> "He didn't believe that putting his faith in a polytheistic structure would do him any good—he believed himself worthy of a god's stature. This, of course, made him the perfect candidate for archwizardry, since all the archwizards believed in only themselves."
> — TSR Netheril Expansion

### The Loss of the Nether Scrolls

In his ambition, Karsus persuaded Seventon's council to loan him the remaining Nether Scrolls for study. The caravan transporting them was ransacked despite being "guarded by over 100 warriors and arcanists." The seven-year search that followed cost 125 lives and ended in failure. Netheril now possessed none of its founding magical texts.

## Prelude to Disaster

### The Phaerimm War

By 3520 NY, Netheril faced an existential threat. The phaerimm—aberrant creatures of the Underdark—had been casting magic drain and life drain spells that threatened the very magical infrastructure that kept the enclaves aloft. The desert of Anauroch spread as the land withered.

The sharn had entered the conflict against the phaerimm, but their magic caused "geological disruptions all across Anauroch" as it collided with phaerimm spells. Mountains reformed, new ranges appeared, and the High Ice expanded.

### Ioulaum's Disappearance

In 3520 NY, the archwizard Ioulaum—creator of the mythallar and nearly 3,000 years old—disappeared:

> "Several of his friends, including Karsus, believed he left Netheril because he depended heavily on magic to maintain his life... His final fate remained unknown."
> — TSR Netheril Expansion

### Panic and Desperation

> "Panic surged through Netheril as the citizens learned of Ioulaum's disappearance, and the archwizards that remained feared that there would be a revolt. Karsus, feeling the responsibility for Netheril's future on his shoulders, felt that it was his duty to weld the nation back together."
> — TSR Netheril Expansion

## The Spell: Karsus's Avatar

### The Only 12th-Level Spell

Facing the phaerimm threat and the potential collapse of Netherese morale, Karsus completed a spell he had been developing for years:

> "This spell, called Karsus's avatar, was the only 12th-level spell ever created. It was designed to temporarily steal the powers of a deity."
> — TSR Netheril Expansion

### The Fatal Choice

When Karsus cast the spell, he chose **Mystryl, the goddess of magic**, as his target.

> "Knowledge has always outweighed wisdom, and Karsus was no exception."
> — TSR Netheril Expansion

### The Moment of Godhood

> "His body swelled with the sudden influx of godly power, and his mind filled with unimaginable knowledge. Karsus instantly realized the horrible mistake he had made: He stole the power from the one god he shouldn't have."
> — TSR Netheril Expansion

---

## Why Mystryl?

### The Weave's Constant Guardian

Mystryl's divine role was unique among the gods. One aspect of her psyche was required to **constantly rework the Weave of magic**—the magical infrastructure that Netheril's glut of magic and the phaerimm's drain spells threatened to unravel.

> "When Mystryl lost her ability to keep the weave of essential magic (magic in its purest unschooled and unfielded form) intact, the inundation of magic surged and fluctuated, and the effects of all things magical doubled for a time—a short time."
> — TSR Netheril Expansion

### The Chain Reaction

With no one maintaining the Weave:
1. Magic surged and fluctuated wildly
2. All magical effects doubled briefly
3. The Weave began to unravel

---

## Mystryl's Sacrifice

### Death and Rebirth

To prevent irreparable damage to the Weave, Mystryl took the only action she could:

> "Mystryl sacrificed herself to save the weave before the damage became irreparable. This broke Karsus's link to her magic and obstructed the weave, causing all magic to briefly cease functioning."
> — TSR Netheril Expansion

### The Moment All Magic Stopped

For a brief, terrible moment, every magical effect in Faerûn failed. And high above the land, held aloft only by magic...

---

## The Fall

### Cities Crashing to Earth

> "Without the infusion of magic, the floating cities of Netheril fell, and Karsus was instantly slain. His bloated body petrified and toppled from the high plateau above his floating city and plummeted to earth."
> — TSR Netheril Expansion

### Karsus's Final Vision

> "As his body fell, his stony eyes, still shimmering with the last glint of godly omniscience, caught a glimpse of the cities of Netheril smashing to the ground, killing all their inhabitants. His heart broke—greed for the power of the deities themselves caused the destruction of his home, his family, his friends, and his people."
> — TSR Netheril Expansion

---

## The Birth of Mystra

### A New Goddess of Magic

> "When Mystryl reincarnated herself—this time as Mystra—she used the form of a beautiful peasant girl learning the basics of cantra magic but with the capacities for archwizardry."
> — TSR Netheril Expansion

### The New Rules

Mystra's first priority was to recreate the Weave. But this time, she imposed fundamental limitations:

> "This time, she made magic follow a few more rules, and no spell above 10th level would function."
> — TSR Netheril Expansion

This single change ensures that no mortal will ever again cast a spell capable of stealing a god's power.

### The Three Saved

By the time Mystra finished restructuring the Weave, she was able to save only three of Netheril's floating cities:

> "These three—Anauria, Asram, and Hlondath—were high enough above the ground to survive. The cities safely landed, and the survivors stumbled away from the cities in shock."
> — TSR Netheril Expansion

---

## The Immediate Aftermath

### The Warning to All Spellcasters

> "Priests and priestesses of the new goddess of magic were told the story of Karsus in dreams and visions when they prayed for spells. It was Mystra's attempt to make sure that nothing like this ever happened again."
> — TSR Netheril Expansion

### Karsus's Legacy

> "Yet Karsus was accredited as being the only human to have ever achieved godhood through spellcasting, even if was only for a fleeting moment."
> — TSR Netheril Expansion

### The Diaspora

Within months, the survivors of the three saved cities fled:

> "About one-third migrated northward, with the rest traveling south to create the shadows—or 'survivor states' for the optimistic—of Netheril; Anauria, Asram, and Hlondath."
> — TSR Netheril Expansion

They fled "fearful of the phaerimm, the gods, and the orcs."

---

## The Stone Corpse of Karsus

### A God's Mistake Becomes a Shrine

> "Some of those who traveled north followed 'dream visions' and built a small city near the bleeding red stone corpse of Karsus, mistaking the former archwizard's petrified corpse as that of a dying god. They named their city Karse in honor of the finding of their 'god.'"
> — TSR Netheril Expansion

This worship "angered other nearby denizens," suggesting the establishment of Karsus-worship created immediate conflicts.

---

## The End of the End (3826-4188 NY)

The Fall was not the final chapter of Netheril's destruction. The survivor states met their own dooms over the following centuries:

### Asram (3826 NY)
> "Asram was hit by the worst plague in the history of Toril, decimating the whole population in one month. Even those who escaped the scourged area died."
> — TSR Netheril Expansion

The plague was sent by **Talona** to gain worshipers and power enough to defeat a rival deity, Kiputytto.

### Anauria (3970 NY)
Fell to an orc attack, but "delivered a blow to the marauding beasts that required a whole millennia to recover from."

### Hlondath (4188 NY)
> "Its last dying breath went unheard... as the desert of Anauroch consumed its fields, starving its people and sending them scurrying into the heart of Faerûn."
> — TSR Netheril Expansion

---

## The Sharn and the End of the Phaerimm

The cessation of Anauroch's spread after Hlondath's fall remains mysterious:

> "Many suspected that the sharn—powerful spellcasters whose magic transformed the land around them as they cast their spells—were the source of the phaerimm's ending of the magic drain spells. Still others believe that the lack of magic in the area caused the phaerimm's spells to collapse inward on themselves."
> — TSR Netheril Expansion

## Theological Implications

### The Nature of Divine Power

Karsus's Folly demonstrated that divine power is not merely "stronger magic." Mystryl's role required constant attention—a fact that even the combined power of all Netherese arcanists could not replace. The gods serve functions that mortals cannot comprehend, let alone perform.

### The Weave as Infrastructure

The Fall revealed that the Weave is not a passive phenomenon but an actively maintained system. Without constant divine attention, it unravels—and when it unravels, all magic fails simultaneously.

### Mystra's Vigilance

The new goddess of magic learned from her predecessor's fate. She now actively shares Karsus's story with all who pray to her for spells, ensuring the lesson is never forgotten.

## Contradictions & Notes

1. **Spell Level Limitations:** Sources differ on whether Mystra's limitation prevents the *creation* of spells above 10th level or merely prevents them from *functioning*. The distinction matters for understanding artifacts that might predate the limitation.

2. **The Three Survivors:** Why were Anauria, Asram, and Hlondath specifically "high enough" to survive? Were they simply at greater altitude, or was there something special about their positioning?

3. **Karsus's Motivation:** Was Karsus attempting to save Netheril from the phaerimm, or was his claim of responsibility merely a justification for his ambition? The sources present both interpretations.

4. **Modern Echoes:** The Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide references Netheril's defeat by Cormyr in relatively recent times, suggesting survivors or successors persisted far beyond the original Fall—possibly the Shadovar or other groups who escaped to the Plane of Shadow.

## Further Research Needed

- **The Crown of Karsus:** A specific artifact mentioned in connection with Karsus requires additional source investigation (possibly BG3-specific content)
- **Karsus's Avatar Spell Components:** The specific components, casting time, and mechanical details of the only 12th-level spell
- **The Shadovar:** Netherese who escaped to the Plane of Shadow and returned in later ages
- **Karse:** The city built around Karsus's corpse and its ultimate fate
- **Shadow Weave:** Alternative magical systems that emerged in response to Mystra's limitations
