## Overview

Netheril stands as perhaps the greatest human magical civilization to ever grace Faerûn—and also serves as the most poignant cautionary tale about the dangers of unchecked magical ambition. From humble beginnings as fishing villages along the Narrow Sea, the Netherese rose to command floating cities that blotted out the sun, only to see their entire civilization crash to earth in a single catastrophic moment.

The empire's history spans roughly 3,500 years, divided into distinct ages that chart its rise from primitive settlement to magical superpower to smoking ruins. Understanding Netheril is essential to understanding modern Faerûn, for the echoes of its fall still reverberate through the Weave itself.

## The Nether Age: Origins and the Discovery of Magic

### Early Settlement

The Netherese began as simple fisherfolk along the Narrow Sea, their earliest settlements dating to roughly Year 1 of the Netheril Year (NY) calendar. These early communities—including Seventon and Zenith—were unremarkable by any magical standard.

### The Nether Scrolls

The pivotal moment in Netherese history came in **326 NY** with the discovery of the Nether Scrolls:

> "The year 326 marked one of the most important dates in Netheril's history—the discovery of the nether scrolls... This set of 100 scrolls provided the Netherese with an incredible jump in spellcraft unseen in the history of Toril."
> — TSR Netheril Expansion

The discoverer, known as Finder, encountered the scrolls in ancient ruins built by a race that "utilized the walls as well as the floor" with "chairs and utilitarian furnishings [that] seemed to indicate the species possessed more than two legs—possibly four." He named them after his homeland and shared their secrets with the arcanists of Seventon and Zenith.

The scrolls appeared to be divided into two sets of 50, with one set appearing older than the other. Within decades, their knowledge had spread throughout Netheril, fundamentally transforming the society.

### The Two Great Losses

The Nether Scrolls would not remain in Netherese possession:

1. **764 NY** - Half of the scrolls (the newer-looking set) were stolen from heavily trapped and warded vaults. Despite extensive searches, they were never recovered.

2. **Circa 3195 NY** - Karsus persuaded the council of Seventon to loan the remaining scrolls for study. The caravan—guarded by over 100 warriors and arcanists—was ransacked and the scrolls stolen. A seven-year search cost 125 lives but failed to recover them.

> "Netheril now had none of the nether scrolls in its possession, and their whereabouts perplexed even the greatest arcanists and seers."

## The Mythallar Era: The Key to Flight

### Ioulaum the Creator

Born in 544 NY, **Ioulaum** was "one of the greatest human archwizards to ever grace the lands of Toril—quite possibly the longest-lived creature known." He trained over 3,000 arcanists and became the catalyst for Netherese magical development.

### The Mythallar

In **845 NY**, Ioulaum created the device that would define Netheril's golden age:

> "This magical device dug deep into the weave of magic (controlled by the goddess Mystryl) and gave access to raw, unfiltered magic. It allowed Netherese arcanists to create magical items without need of a permanency spell and provided the constant magical force that allowed entire mountains to hover in the air."
> — TSR Netheril Expansion

### The Revolution of Quasimagical Items

Before the mythallar, creating permanent magical items required arcanists to sacrifice their own vitality. Such mages "could be picked out of the crowd: Their bodies appeared much older and bent than their years."

The mythallar changed everything. Within its one-mile radius, "quasimagical items"—essentially permanent incantations—could function without draining the creator. Ioulaum himself created the first in 848 NY: "an elaborate mantle that allowed the wearer to see in the dark and hear the thoughts of all those within 20 feet."

The prices of such items dropped to one-tenth the previous rate, and Netheril experienced "a glut of magical items."

## High Netheril and Low Netheril

### The Floating Enclaves

As mythallars proliferated, archwizards began lifting entire mountains into the sky. Each enclave became a city-state unto itself, with the creating archwizard as absolute ruler:

> "As the leader and creator of [his] Enclave, the archwizard was in absolute control. He allowed the people to have a say—and he sometimes took their advice and wishes to heart—but when it came right down to hard decisions, [the archwizard] made them all."
> — TSR Netheril Expansion

### Social Division

This created a fundamental split in Netherese society:

**High Netheril:** The floating enclaves, home to archwizards and those who served them. As time progressed, "the people had less and less say, and their voice regarding changes in government, tax rates, and the such were drowned out by the archwizards' lust for more power." The enclaves "became a vehicle to provide funding for the archwizards' spell research, a staging area for campaigns against other archwizards, and excursions into the quasi- and paraelemental planes."

**Low Netheril:** The ground-bound settlements that provided resources, labor, and recruits for the enclaves above. These communities lived literally in the shadow of High Netheril.

## The Ages of Netheril

### The Silver Age

Following the Mythallar Era, the Silver Age saw the proliferation of floating enclaves and the establishment of Netheril as the preeminent magical power in Faerûn.

### The Golden Age (begins circa 1652 NY)

Marked by the birth of the Chronomancer, this era represented "when the nation was at the very height of its power."

> "Every archwizard who created his enclave heeded Ioulaum's example, setting up his or her own laws and guidelines that the enclave's residents had to follow."
> — TSR Netheril Expansion

**The Chronomancer's Warning:** Unlike other archwizards, the Chronomancer "cared about the well-being of Netheril's neighbors" and "felt that Netheril's snobbery toward less-magically developed nations was a mistake that would come back and haunt the empire."

### The Age of Discovery (2654+ NY)

Netherese archwizards, "feeling a bit cramped," began expanding their sphere of influence. They explored both east and west, finding the western lands—controlled by "barbaric tribesmen who were sired by the consummation of the Earthmother and a wolf"—more to their liking.

### The Shadowed Age (3163-3519 NY)

This final era "heralded the arrival of the phaerimm, the birth of Olostin, and the discovery of even more powerful magic." It began with the birth of Karsus in 3163 NY and ended with the utterance of a single spell.

## The Archwizard Mindset

A crucial detail for understanding Netheril's fall: the archwizards' view of divinity.

> "Like all of Netheril archwizards, [the Chronomancer] believed the gods were merely archwizards like himself who had found 'ultimate magic.' Their pride wouldn't allow them to put their faith in the deities for fear if they put their trust in these advanced archwizards, they would never achieve 'ultimate magic' themselves."
> — TSR Netheril Expansion

This belief—that the gods were simply more powerful mages who could be challenged and surpassed—would prove the empire's undoing.

## Relations with Other Races

The Netherese interacted primarily with:

- **Elves of Eaerlann:** "The greatest threat to orc invasions," they fought with such fervor that the Netherese were "in awe"
- **Dwarves:** Maintained trade routes and guarded passages through the Underdark
- **Orcs:** Constant threat, particularly from the Hidden Forest
- **Illithids and Drow:** Threats in the Underdark that dwarves helped contain

Some enclaves were notably xenophobic. In certain cities, "elves, dwarves, gnomes, and halflings were followed around by the town's constabulary, and the penalty for the slightest infraction of any law was death for nonhumans. The law was much more lenient in its judgment of humans."

---

## The Phaerimm Threat

In the Shadowed Age, Netheril faced a new enemy: the phaerimm. These creatures cast "magic drain and life drain spells" that threatened the magical foundations of Netherese civilization. The conflict transformed "mountains into rolling hills" and accelerated "the spread of the desert" (Anauroch).

The sharn entered the conflict against the phaerimm, but "made no effort to contact the Netherese archwizards, preferring instead to act on their own." The Netherese found themselves "caught in the middle of the two warring races."

---

## Contradictions & Notes

1. **Nether Scroll Origins:** The ruins where the scrolls were found suggest a non-humanoid creator race with four or more legs. The identity of these original creators remains unknown.

2. **The Archwizard Theology:** Sources consistently portray archwizards as viewing gods as "advanced archwizards," yet priesthoods of Mystryl clearly existed and functioned. This suggests either hypocrisy or a more nuanced relationship between archwizard pride and practical theology.

3. **Modern Legacy:** The Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide notes that even after Netheril's recent final defeat against Cormyr, "the pride of that victory remains strong in Cormyr's collective consciousness"—suggesting Netherese remnants persisted far longer than the original Fall.

## Further Research Needed

- **The Twelve Cities:** While enclaves are discussed extensively, specific identification of a "Twelve Cities" as distinct entities requires additional sources
- **Anauria, Asram, and Hlondath:** The three survivor states that "safely landed" deserve dedicated research
- **The Sharn:** Their origins, motivations, and ultimate fate
- **Post-Fall Netheril:** The Shadovar and other successor states that emerged after the original Fall
