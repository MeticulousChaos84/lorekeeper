## Overview

The history of Faerûn is marked by catastrophic events that have repeatedly reshaped the world—sometimes literally. From the ancient Crown Wars that sundered elvenkind to the recent Second Sundering that restored what the Spellplague had destroyed, each cataclysm has fundamentally altered the political, magical, and physical landscape of the Realms.

> "The last one hundred fifty years have comprised one of the most cataclysmic periods in Faerûn's history. On no fewer than three occasions, Toril has been shaken to its core by forces that have repeatedly rewritten the laws of reality."

## The Crown Wars (-12,000 to -9,000 DR)

### Overview

The Crown Wars were a series of devastating conflicts between ancient elven nations that lasted approximately three thousand years and resulted in the permanent sundering of elvenkind.

### The Combatants

- **Aryvandaar:** Elven nation of the north, later blamed for the Dark Disaster
- **Miyeritar:** Elven nation destroyed by the Dark Disaster
- **Ilythiir:** Dark elf nation that turned to demonic powers

### The Dark Disaster

> "These conflicts culminated in the Dark Disaster, in which terrible storms engulfed Miyeritar, turning it into a wasteland within a single season, leaving behind the area now known as the High Moor. The high mages of Aryvandaar are blamed for the destruction, although no proof was ever produced."
> — Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

### The Ilythiiri Response

> "The vengeful dark elves of Ilythiir turned to corrupt and demonic powers, unleashing them against Aryvandaar. In the centuries of destruction that followed, elf priests and high mages fervently prayed to Corellon Larethian and the gods of the elven pantheon for salvation."
> — Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

### The Descent of the Drow

Corellon's intervention ended the Crown Wars—and created the drow:

> "Corellon interceded in the Crown Wars and cursed the dark elves so that they might never dwell comfortably under the sun. Now finding themselves pained by exposure to daylight, the drow—in a mere two months' time—retreated from the sunlit lands of the World Above into the Underdark."
> — Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

The dark elves "abandoned all loyalty to the elven gods who betrayed and banished them, turning instead to Lolth, the Demon Queen of Spiders, as their patron."

### Legacy

- Created the High Moor wasteland
- Established the drow as a separate, hostile race
- Began millennia of drow-dwarf warfare in the Underdark
- Marked the beginning of elven decline and human ascendancy

## The Fall of Netheril (3520 NY / -339 DR)

*See: [[karsus_folly.md]] for complete details*

### Summary

> "The power-mad Netherese arcanist Karsus attempted to usurp the role of the goddess of magic. The resulting disruption in the fabric of magic sent Netheril's floating cities crashing to the ground, destroyed a host of other wards and enchantments, and brought about the end of the great empire."
> — Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

### Key Details

- **Cause:** Karsus's Avatar spell stole Mystryl's power
- **Divine Response:** Mystryl sacrificed herself; reborn as Mystra
- **Immediate Effect:** All magic ceased functioning momentarily
- **Result:** Floating cities crashed; mass casualties
- **Long-term:** Magic limited to 10th level maximum

## The Time of Troubles (1358 DR)

### The Divine Exile

> "In 1358 DR, the gods were cast out of their otherworldly domain and made to wander the land incarnated as mortals."
> — Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

### Effects

> "In seeking to recover their divinity, they warred among themselves. Magic became unpredictable, and the prayers of the faithful went unanswered."
> — Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

### Divine Casualties and Ascensions

> "Some of the gods-turned-mortal were slain, while a handful of mortals ascended to godhood, assuming the responsibilities of the dead deities."
> — Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

### Known Deaths and Ascensions

Notable changes included:
- Death of Myrkul (Lord of Bones)
- Death of Bhaal (Lord of Murder)
- Death of Bane (Lord of Tyranny)
- Ascension of Cyric to multiple portfolios
- Ascension of Kelemvor as god of the dead

**Note:** The Dead Three would later return, with Bhaal's rebirth in 1482 DR marking the beginning of the Second Sundering.

## The Return of Netheril (1374 DR)

### The City of Shade

> "In 1374 DR, the Empire of Netheril rose again when the floating city of Thultanthar, commonly known as Shade, returned from a nearly two-thousand-year-long excursion in the Shadowfell, to hover above the Anauroch desert."
> — Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

### Netherese Agenda

> "The shadow-touched nobles of the city almost immediately began hunting for ancient Netherese ruins and artifacts and preparing for a restoration of their once-great empire."
> — Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

### Significance

The Shadovar (shadow-touched Netherese) represented survivors of the original Fall who had escaped to the Plane of Shadow. Their return would lead to:
- Wars with Cormyr and Myth Drannor
- Conflict with the Bedine peoples
- Eventual destruction during the Second Sundering

---

## The Spellplague (1385 DR)

### Cause: The Murder of Mystra

> "In 1385 DR, the ascended deity Cyric, aided by Shar, murdered Mystra, the goddess of magic, in her domain of Dweomerheart."
> — Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

### Immediate Effects

> "This act ripped asunder the fabric of magic in the world, unleashing its raw power in a catastrophe called the Spellplague. Thousands of practitioners of the Art were driven mad or killed."
> — Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

### Geographic Devastation

> "The face of Faerûn was reshaped by waves and veils of mystic blue fire. Entire nations were displaced or exchanged with realms from other worlds, and parts of the earth were torn free to float in the air."
> — Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

### Specific Consequences

- **Halruaa:** "Once believed destroyed in the conflagration of the Spellplague." Halruaan wizards used the blue fire to propel their nation into the realm of Abeir.
- **Luiren:** "Lost during the Spellplague to a great inundation of the sea."
- **Lantan and Nimbral:** Vanished entirely

### Earthmotes and Plagueland

The Spellplague created:
- Floating earthmotes (chunks of land suspended in air)
- Plaguelands of wild magic
- Plaguecaves in the Underdark

### Duration

The Spellplague's effects persisted for a century until the Second Sundering.

## The Second Sundering (1482-1489 DR)

### Bhaal's Return (1482 DR)

> "The first indication of new turmoil came in 1482 DR, when Bhaal, the long-dead god of murder, was reborn in Baldur's Gate amid chaos and bloodshed, leaving two of the city's dukes and many of its citizens dead."
> — Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

> "The return of Bhaal and his apparent reclamation of the domain of murder from Cyric led some scholars and sages to believe that the rules by which all deities must abide were in flux."
> — Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

### The Calamities (1484 DR)

> "Strange calamities began to occur throughout Faerûn. An earthquake struck Iriaebor. A plague of locusts afflicted Amn. Droughts gripped the southern lands as the sea steadily receded in places."
> — Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

### The Wars of the Sundering

Multiple conflicts erupted:
- Orcs of Many-Arrows vs. dwarfholds of the North
- Sembia invaded the Dalelands
- Cormyr raised armies to defend the Dales
- Netheril threatened Cormyr's borders

### The Chosen

> "Tales began to spread of individuals who had been touched by the gods and granted strange powers. Some of these so-called Chosen were at the root of the conflicts that grip the land."
> — Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

### The Great Rain (1485-1486 DR)

> "In the autumn of 1485 the Great Rain began to fall around the Sea of Fallen Stars and continued unceasingly."
> — Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

> "The Sea of Fallen Stars had grown, submerging great swaths of land beneath its waves."
> — Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

### The World Convulses (1487 DR)

> "Earthquakes and volcanic eruptions abounded for months, as if the whole world was convulsing. Rumors spread of chasms caused by the Spellplague suddenly vanishing, and stories circulated of known destinations being farther away from one another, as if the world had quietly added miles of wilderness to the distance between them."
> — Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

### Nations Restored

> "Ships claiming to be from Evermeet, Lantan, and Nimbral—nations thought vanished or destroyed—sailed into ports on the Sword Coast and in the Shining South. Tales spread of the legendary skyships of Halruaa being spotted in southern skies."
> — Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

### The Final Fall of Netheril

> "Netheril attacked Myth Drannor by floating the City of Shade over it. In a struggle for control of Myth Drannor's mythal and the Weave itself, the flying capital of Netheril was brought crashing down on Myth Drannor, resulting in the cataclysmic destruction of both."
> — Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

### Aftermath (1488-1489 DR)

- The League of Silver Marches disbanded
- Sembia fragmented into separate city-states
- The Netherese Empire ended permanently
- Phaerimm awakened at the Memory Spire

> "By 1489, many of the wars that began during the Sundering had ground to a close... The gods were no longer silent but quiet, and in many places new priesthoods arose to interpret the gods' now subtle signs."
> — Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

## Patterns and Themes

### Magic as Vulnerability

Every major cataclysm involves magic:
- Crown Wars: High magic destroyed Miyeritar
- Fall of Netheril: Magic overreach destroyed the empire
- Spellplague: Death of Mystra unleashed raw magic
- Second Sundering: Restoration of the Weave

### Divine Involvement

Gods play crucial roles:
- Corellon's curse created the drow
- Mystryl's sacrifice saved the Weave
- Cyric's murder of Mystra caused the Spellplague
- The Chosen shaped the Sundering

### Cyclical Destruction and Renewal

Each cataclysm destroys and creates:
- The Crown Wars ended elven dominance; enabled human rise
- Netheril's Fall established magical limitations; created Anauroch
- The Spellplague destroyed nations; created Abeir-Toril connection
- The Second Sundering ended Netheril; restored lost lands

## The Weave: Common Thread

The Weave—the fabric of magic maintained by the goddess of magic—features in every major cataclysm:

1. **Karsus's Folly:** Threatened to unravel the Weave entirely
2. **Mystryl's Sacrifice:** Saved but limited the Weave
3. **The Spellplague:** Weave torn asunder by Mystra's death
4. **The Second Sundering:** Weave restored, Spellplague effects reversed

> "The Weave isn't normally visible or detectable... An understanding of magic begins, and ends, with an understanding of the Weave."
> — Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

## Contradictions & Notes

1. **Timeline Precision:** Some dates vary between sources; this document uses Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide dates as primary.

2. **Mystra's Deaths:** Mystra has now "died" twice (during the Time of Troubles, she was reborn; during the Spellplague, the result was catastrophic). The different outcomes suggest complexity in divine power transfer.

3. **The Dead Three:** Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul all died during the Time of Troubles but have returned. The mechanism for their return varies.

4. **Netheril's Multiple Falls:** Netheril has now fallen twice—once in the original Fall, and again when the City of Shade crashed on Myth Drannor.

## Further Research Needed

- **The First Sundering:** The initial separation of Abeir and Toril (mentioned but not detailed)
- **The Dawn Cataclysm:** Earlier divine conflict referenced in some sources
- **The Orcgate Wars:** Conflict that brought orcs to Faerûn
- **The Fall of Myth Drannor:** The original fall in 714 DR
- **Individual Chosen:** Detailed information on those empowered during the Sundering
