## Overview

The illithids—commonly known as mind flayers—represent one of the most ancient and terrible threats to surface civilizations. These aberrant creatures possess vast psionic powers, consume humanoid brains, and reproduce through a horrific process called ceremorphosis. Their empire once spanned the cosmos, and even in its diminished state, the illithid threat lurks in the Underdark and beyond, waiting for the opportunity to restore their former glory.

## Origins: The Far Realm Connection

### Aberrant Nature

The mind flayers are fundamentally alien to the natural order of the multiverse:

> "Aberrations such as mind flayers and beholders are either from this plane or shaped by its strange influence."
> — Dungeon Master's Guide, 5e

The Far Realm exists outside normal cosmology:

> "Where stray energies from the Far Realm leak onto another plane, matter is warped into alien shapes that defy understandable geometry and biology."
> — Dungeon Master's Guide, 5e

### The Unknowable Entities

> "The entities that abide in the Far Realm itself are too alien for a normal mind to accept without strain."
> — Dungeon Master's Guide, 5e

This alien origin explains much about illithid psychology—their cold logic, their view of other races as cattle, and their fundamentally incomprehensible long-term goals.

## The Ancient Illithid Empire

While the available sources do not contain detailed histories of the illithid empire's rise and fall, scattered references paint a picture of a once-vast civilization:

### Cosmic Reach

The illithids were not confined to the Underdark. Their nautiloids—bizarre organic spelljamming vessels—allowed them to traverse Wildspace and prey upon countless worlds.

From the Spelljammer source:
> "Illustrator Bruce Brenneise depicts a nautiloid traveling through Wildspace, undoubtedly transporting mind flayers to an unsuspecting world."

### Reputation Among Netherese

During Netheril's height (circa 2795 NY), illithid spelljamming ships inspired terror comparable to the worst reputation imaginable:

> "[Netherese ships had] a very bad name and a horrid reputation—akin to the fear generated when an illithid spelljamming ship was seen."
> — TSR Netheril Expansion

This comparison indicates that even the mighty Netherese—at the height of their magical power—feared the illithids.

## Nautiloids: Ships of the Mind

### Design and Function

Nautiloids serve as the primary vessels of illithid space travel:

> "Built and used by mind flayers, nautiloids are designed exclusively for space travel. They can't float on water, nor can they land safely on the ground."
> — Spelljammer: Adventures in Space

### Planar Travel Capability

Unlike most spelljamming vessels, nautiloids can traverse the planes:

> "As an action, a creature attuned to a nautiloid's spelljamming helm and in physical contact with the ship can transport the nautiloid and all creatures and objects aboard it to a different plane of existence, at or near a destination envisioned by the spelljammer."
> — Spelljammer: Adventures in Space

### Combat Capabilities

Nautiloids possess organic tentacles capable of:
- **Grappling:** Seizing Huge or Gargantuan targets (including other ships)
- **Teleportation Attack:** Forcibly teleporting creatures aboard the nautiloid

> "Melee Spell Attack: +8 to hit, reach 30 ft., one creature. Hit: The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be teleported to an unoccupied space aboard the nautiloid that the nautiloid's spelljammer can see."
> — Spelljammer: Adventures in Space

## The Underdark Presence

### Current Status

Following the collapse of their surface empire, illithids retreated to the Underdark, where they maintain colonies and plot their return:

> "In these depths, drow rule mighty cities, the queen of which is the metropolis of Menzoberranzan. But their rule is far from absolute. In dark tunnels, mind flayers conspire, and aboleths slide on mucus trails."
> — Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide

### Ongoing Activities

Mind flayers continue active operations:

> "It was the lair of a group of outlaw priests and slavers until a mind flayer colony emerged from an unexplored tributary tunnel and converted all the bandits to thralls. Now the mind flayers commit the bandit groups to ever more daring raids..."
> — Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide

### Territorial Conflicts

The illithids contest territory with other Underdark powers:

> "Rumors held that they were involved in a bitter rivalry with drow and illithids, but no news of such a conflict was verified."
> — TSR Netheril Expansion (regarding kuo-toa)

---

## Infiltration of Surface Societies

### Noble Family Manipulation

From Elminster's Forgotten Realms, we learn that illithids actively infiltrate surface societies:

> "Doppelgangers, illithids, and beholders—have covertly sought out such families. An incursion starts with the monsters seeking to ally with the corrupt families, and ends with them slowly taking control of the families, making them their human agents."
> — Elminster's Forgotten Realms

### Predatory Nature

> "It does seem that mind flayers, doppelgangers, kenkus, and others who regard civilized folk as prey, dupes, cattle, or potential victims have grasped this ruse all too well."
> — Elminster's Forgotten Realms

---

## Historical Interactions with Other Civilizations

### Netheril

The dwarves actively defended trade routes against illithid incursions:

> "Back before the days of the phaerimm, this was an area actively patrolled by the dwarves in order to keep it free of illithids, drow, and other denizens of the evil Underdark."
> — TSR Netheril Expansion

### Ancient Barbarian Tribes

The Rengarth and Angardt peoples preserve memories of liberation from illithid oppression:

> "Particularly brave men and women—especially those lobbying for elite positions of power—made the years-long travel to the mountains in order to get closer to the gods responsible for their liberation from the undead and illithid forces (an event that occurred long before the formation of Netheril)."
> — TSR Netheril Expansion

This indicates that illithid enslavement of surface populations predates even ancient Netheril.

## Ceremorphosis

The process by which illithids reproduce remains one of the most horrifying aspects of their biology. A tadpole is implanted in a humanoid host's brain, where it consumes and replaces the host's mind, eventually transforming the body into a new mind flayer.

**Note:** While ceremorphosis is referenced in connection with the Absolute conspiracy and BG3 content, detailed mechanical descriptions are not present in the available sources.

---

## The Elder Brain

Each illithid colony is governed by an Elder Brain—a massive brain-like entity that serves as the repository of all knowledge and memories from deceased mind flayers in the colony. The Elder Brain:
- Directs colony activities
- Preserves collective knowledge
- May have its own agenda separate from individual illithids

The Elder Brain's role in the Absolute conspiracy (see: [[the_absolute.md]]) suggests these entities are capable of extraordinary long-term planning.

---

## Communication Methods

### With Other Species

Illithids communicate telepathically, typically within 120 feet. They can also understand certain related languages:

> "They communicate by means of a humming sound created by skin vibrations (a language partially understood by mind flayers) and by 120'-range telepathy."
> — TSR Netheril Expansion (describing tomb tappers)

---

## Threat Assessment

Mind flayers are considered a significant threat appropriate for experienced adventurers:

> "Mind flayers and drow assassins... They might have a chance of defeating a young dragon that has established a lair..."
> — Dungeon Master's Guide, 5e

This places them in the context of adventures for characters of levels 5-10.

## Contradictions & Notes

1. **Timeline Ambiguity:** The sources mention illithid enslavement of surface populations "long before the formation of Netheril" but don't specify when or how this empire fell.

2. **Current Empire Status:** Some sources suggest the illithid empire is fallen and diminished; others (like the Absolute conspiracy) suggest they are actively working toward restoration.

3. **The Gith Factor:** No mention of the gith—githyanki and githzerai—who traditionally are presented as former slaves who overthrew the illithid empire. This is a significant gap in the available sources.

---

## Further Research Needed

- **The Ancient Empire:** Detailed history of the illithid empire's rise, extent, and fall
- **The Gith Rebellion:** The slave revolt that supposedly ended illithid dominance
- **Ceremorphosis Mechanics:** Detailed process and variations (such as partial transformation seen in BG3)
- **Elder Brain Psychology:** Goals and motivations of these collective intelligences
- **Illithid Variations:** Mind flayer arcanists, ulitharids, and other subtypes
- **The Absolute Conspiracy:** How a specific Elder Brain orchestrated the events of BG3
