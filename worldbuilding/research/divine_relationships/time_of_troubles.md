## Overview

The Time of Troubles, also known as the Avatar Crisis or the Godswar, occurred in 1358 DR (the Year of Shadows). This cataclysmic event saw the gods of Faerûn forced to walk Toril in mortal avatar form, resulting in widespread destruction, divine deaths, and permanent changes to the nature of magic and faith.

The event was so significant that a new timekeeping system, Present Reckoning (PR), was established with the Time of Troubles as Year 0.

## Cause: The Tablets of Fate

### Ao's Judgment

The overgod Ao cast down all the deities of Faerûn because two of them—Bane and Myrkul—had stolen the Tablets of Fate. These artifacts recorded the roles and responsibilities of each deity. When Ao demanded the tablets' return and the gods could not or would not comply, he banished all of them to walk Toril as mortals.

### The Divine Exile

All deities were:
- Stripped of their divine homes in the Outer Planes
- Forced to inhabit mortal avatar forms
- Made vulnerable to death
- Unable to return to the planes until the Tablets were recovered

---

## Key Events and Participants

### Helm's Vigil

One god was exempt from the exile: **Helm, the Watcher**. Ao tasked Helm with guarding the Celestial Stairways—the paths by which gods could ascend back to their divine homes.

> "In legends, he is honorable and keeps his word to a fault, such as when he guarded the celestial stairways during the Time of Troubles, preventing the gods from ascending them and continuing the chaos of that period, until the Tablets of Fate were found." - Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

This duty made Helm both reviled and respected:
- He prevented gods from escaping their punishment
- He extended the chaos by maintaining Ao's decree
- His faithful believe this demonstrates ultimate loyalty to duty

The **Helmlands** (also called "the Pits of Mystra") in Cormyr are named as a reminder of Helm's role, though the region's magical devastation came from the chaotic energies released during this time.

### The Death of the First Mystra

The goddess of magic, Mystra (the second incarnation, not to be confused with the original Mystryl), perished during the Time of Troubles. Her death caused immediate magical chaos across Faerûn, though the worst effects were temporary as a new Mystra arose.

### Divine Combat

Multiple gods died during this period, and their portfolios were claimed by others:
- **Bane** - died (later returned)
- **Bhaal** - died (his essence scattered among his mortal offspring, the Bhaalspawn)
- **Myrkul** - died
- **Mystra** - died
- Various other deities perished or were significantly diminished

### The Avatar of Tymora

> "It was here that the avatar of the Luck Maiden appeared to the populace and protected the city during [the Time of Troubles]." - Campaign Setting Box Set (regarding Arabel's temple)

Tymora's avatar manifested in Arabel at the Lady's House temple, defending the city during the divine chaos.

### Midnight's Ascension

A mortal woman named Midnight, who had been traveling with companions including Kelemvor and Cyric, recovered the Tablets of Fate and presented them to Ao. As a reward—and because the goddess of magic was needed—Midnight was elevated to godhood and became the new Mystra.

### Other Mortals Elevated

- **Cyric** - Ascended to godhood, taking portfolios of murder, strife, and lies
- **Kelemvor** - Later ascended to become god of the dead, replacing Myrkul

## Consequences and Aftermath

### Changes to Magic

The Time of Troubles permanently altered magical practice in the Realms:

**Wild Magic and Dead Magic Zones**
> "The Helmlands are the name given to the foothills surrounding the eastern Storm Horns near Gnoll Pass and Castle Crag. During the Time of Troubles, these lands erupted in a series of bubbling tar pits, which scarred the region. To make matters worse, the area is marked with widespread and random wild magic and dead magic areas where the rules of spellcasting break down or fail entirely." - Campaign Setting Box Set

These problematic areas have reduced since the Time of Troubles but remain a lasting legacy.

**Rise of Specialist Wizards**
> "Specialist mages have always existed in the Realms, but their numbers (save for the illusionists) were never great previous to the Time of Troubles. Most of the old guard wizards like Khelben and Elminster are nonspecialized mages. Since the Time of Troubles, the number of specialist wizards has increased, and these wizards have differing attitudes from their elders." - Campaign Setting Box Set

This created a "magical gap in ages" between older generalist wizards and younger specialists.

### Changes to Divine Relationships

**Dragons and Subdual**
> "It should also be noted that since the Time of Troubles a decade ago, there is no recorded instance of a dragon agreeing to such combat or surrendering in this fashion to a mortal creature." - Campaign Setting Box Set

Dragons ceased honoring traditional subdual combat arrangements after witnessing the gods' vulnerability.

**New Gnome Variety**
> "Gnomes have no subraces, but since the Time of Troubles a different sort of gnome has appeared in the Realms, coming primarily from the South. These gnomes are particularly interested in craft and artifice, including all manner of sciences and invention." - Campaign Setting Box Set

These gnomes venerate Gond Wonderbringer and represent a new direction for their race.

### Political Upheaval

**Shadowdale's Attack**
During the Time of Troubles (1358 DR), Shadowdale was attacked by Zhentil Keep, demonstrating how mortal powers took advantage of divine distraction.

**The Tuigan Horde**
Two years after the Time of Troubles (1360 DR), the barbarian tribes of the Hordelands united under Yamun Khahan and invaded Faerûn. They were turned back by an alliance under King Azoun IV of Cormyr.

## Present Reckoning Dating System

The Time of Troubles was significant enough to spawn a new calendar system:

> "In an attempt to get a handle on the various number systems in use, a new type of reckoning has been implemented with the approval of such worthies as Khelben Arunsun of Waterdeep and Vangerdahast of Cormyr and carried abroad by the Harpers. All year-dates trace back to the Time of Troubles as Year 0." - Campaign Setting Box Set

- **0 PR** = 1358 DR (Time of Troubles)
- **-1358 PR** = 1 DR (Founding of the Standing Stone)
- **9 PR** = 1367 DR (the "present" in the Campaign Setting)

Elminster's assessment: "You have to give a new system a generation or two to hash itself out. At least let it get into double digits."

---

## Era of Upheaval

The Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide places the Time of Troubles as the beginning of the **Era of Upheaval** (1358 DR onwards), marking the end of the **Age of Humanity** (–3000 DR to 1358 DR).

> "1358 DR to Present: The Avatar Crisis, the return of Netheril, the threat of ancient evils long imprisoned—and the Spellplague, whose consequences yet dance and stagger across Toril, and beyond. —Elminster of Shadowdale, Year of the Ageless One (1479 DR)" - Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide

---

## Divine Deaths and Returns

### The Cycle of Divine Death

> "Though deities are immortal, they can be killed, and though they are eternal, they can be created. Over the long history of the cosmos, many beings have ascended to godhood, and just as many have fallen away from the memory of mortals." - Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide

> "Yet, as recent events have borne out, a god who is gone might not remain absent forever. More than a few supposedly dead gods have returned and amassed a new body of worshipers. Indeed, the legends of some gods speak of a cycle of death and resurrection." - Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

> "As the Sage of Shadowdale once noted, 'If the gods can grant the power to raise mortals from death, why do ye assume they should be laid low by it forever?'" - Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

### Bhaal's Return

In 1482 DR, Bhaal was reborn in Baldur's Gate, demonstrating that even gods slain during the Time of Troubles could return. His rebirth was one of the first signs of the Second Sundering.

---

## Legacy and Long-Term Effects

### On Faith and Worship

The Time of Troubles demonstrated that:
- Gods could be killed
- Mortals could ascend to godhood
- Divine portfolios could be transferred
- Faith itself could survive the death of a deity

### On Magic

The chaos of the Avatar Crisis:
- Created permanent wild and dead magic zones
- Changed how wizards approached their studies
- Demonstrated the importance of Mystra's role in stabilizing magic

### On Mortal-Divine Relations

The event taught mortals that:
- Gods were more vulnerable than believed
- Divine punishment could affect the innocent
- Mortal actions could have divine consequences
- Heroes could literally become gods

## Contradictions & Notes

### Helm's Legacy
Sources present Helm's role ambiguously—he was following Ao's orders but also preventing the resolution of the crisis. Some view him as perfectly dutiful; others as needlessly rigid.

### Sequence of Deaths
The exact order in which the Dead Three (Bane, Bhaal, Myrkul) died and the circumstances of each death vary between sources.

### Mystra's Death
Whether the first Mystra's death during the Time of Troubles was directly caused by combat with another god or by the magical chaos itself is not entirely clear in available sources.
