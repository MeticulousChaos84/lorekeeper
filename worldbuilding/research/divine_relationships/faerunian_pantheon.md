## Overview

The Faerûnian pantheon is a vast collection of deities worshiped across the continent of Faerûn. Unlike some worlds where a single pantheon dominates, Faerûn hosts numerous divine beings who compete for worshipers, form alliances, and pursue their own agendas.

The hierarchy and roles of the deities have changed many times over the millennia, and will certainly change again. Gods can be created, transformed, and even killed—though death for a deity is rarely permanent.

### Ancient Rivalries

**Selûne vs. Shar**
The twin goddesses of moon and darkness have warred since the beginning of time. Their conflict represents the fundamental opposition of light and darkness.

**Mystra vs. Shar**
Shar covets the Weave and seeks to replace it with her Shadow Weave. This led to her conspiracy with Cyric to murder Mystra.

## Worship Practices

### Polytheistic Worship

> "The average person worships different gods in different contexts. Most vocations have a patron deity: farmers make offerings to Chauntea for the prosperity of their crops, clerks sharpen their quills with a prayer to Deneir, while pious merchants remember to set coins aside for Waukeen at the end of the day." - Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

### Personal Devotion

Individuals often:
- Carry small tokens of their favored deity
- Wear pendants or pins with holy symbols
- Keep personal keepsakes related to their god
- Pray to different gods for different needs

### Temples and Shrines

**Temples** - Staffed by clergy, dedicated to single deity
**Shrines** - Often unstaffed, may be as simple as:
- A roadside well for prayers to Waukeen
- A statue of Amaunator surrounded by braziers

---

## Death and Return of Gods

### Mortal Gods

> "Though deities are immortal, they can be killed, and though they are eternal, they can be created." - Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide

### The Cycle of Death

> "Yet, as recent events have borne out, a god who is gone might not remain absent forever. More than a few supposedly dead gods have returned and amassed a new body of worshipers. Indeed, the legends of some gods speak of a cycle of death and resurrection." - Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

> "As the Sage of Shadowdale once noted, 'If the gods can grant the power to raise mortals from death, why do ye assume they should be laid low by it forever?'" - Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

---

## Avatars

### Divine Manifestation

> "It's exceedingly rare for gods to physically manifest. Still, they can appear in the world as avatars and thereby interact—often in disguise—with their mortal followers." - Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide

Gods can:
- Take whatever form they desire
- Appear as humans to humans, elves to elves
- Maintain separate personas for different worshipers
- Most have favored forms that remain constant

### Notable Avatar Appearances

- **Tymora** appeared in Arabel during the Time of Troubles
- All gods walked Toril as avatars during the Time of Troubles (1358 DR)

## Racial Pantheons

### Dwarven Pantheon

Dwarves revere a collection of deities known as the Mordinsamman:

| Deity | Alignment | Domains | Symbol |
|-------|-----------|---------|--------|
| Moradin | LG | Forge, Knowledge | Hammer and anvil |
| Abbathor | NE | Trickery | Jeweled dagger |
| Berronar Truesilver | LG | Life, Light | Intertwined rings |
| Clangeddin Silverbeard | LG | War | Crossed axes |
| Deep Duerra | LE | War, Knowledge | Mind flayer skull |
| Dugmaren Brightmantle | CG | Knowledge | Open book |

| Sharindlar | CG | Life | Burning needle |
| Vergadain | N | Trickery | Gold coin |

### Mulhorandi Pantheon

The gods of Mulhorand are a family of deities who have set aside their differences for the betterment of their nation.

---

## Paladin Deities

Paladins draw power from their oath and relationship with the divine. Appropriate patron deities for paladins include:

**Good and Lawful:**
- Azuth, Helm (Lawful Neutral)
- Mystra, Deneir, Lathander, Milil (Neutral Good)
- Chauntea, Mielikki (Neutral Good, though more druids/rangers)

> "No gods who claim true neutrality, evil, or chaos in their ethos and morals have paladins operating in their name." - Campaign Setting Box Set

---

## Important Notes

### Dormant vs. Dead Gods

> "To the deity's worshipers in the world, it is immaterial whether the god is truly dead or merely dormant—the consequences for them are the same either way." - Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

A god without active worshipers may be:
- Truly dead
- Dormant and awaiting revival
- Transformed into another deity
- Imprisoned

### Helm: The Dead God

Helm is described as a "dead god" in some sources, yet his worship never truly faded:

> "Although his faith has known dark days, worship of Helm never truly faded away. Most of his followers believe that the Watcher can never be vanquished utterly, and recent events have borne out that assertion." - Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

---

## Contradictions & Notes

### Amaunator and Lathander
Some sources treat these as the same deity in different forms; others as separate but related gods. Current canon suggests Amaunator transformed into Lathander and later reclaimed his original identity.

### God Tiers
The distinction between "greater gods" and "lesser gods" varies by source. The FRCG lists 18 greater gods; other sources may categorize differently.

### The Mulhorandi Situation
The gods of Mulhorand are sometimes treated as manifestations of their people's faith rather than independent cosmic entities.
