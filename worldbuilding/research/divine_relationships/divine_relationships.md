## Overview

The gods of Faerûn do not exist in isolation. They form alliances, nurse ancient grudges, conspire against one another, and compete for worshipers and influence. Understanding these divine relationships is crucial to comprehending the theological landscape of the Realms.

> "This family of deities bears the scars of all the past loves, rivalries, and wars between them." - Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide (regarding Mulhorand)

This observation applies equally to the entire Faerûnian pantheon.

## Major Divine Alliances

### The Triad

**Members:** Torm, Tyr, Ilmater
**Alignment:** Lawful Good
**Nature:** Cooperative alliance

The Triad represents the complementary virtues of:
- **Torm** - Courage and self-sacrifice
- **Tyr** - Justice
- **Ilmater** - Endurance and compassion

These three gods work together harmoniously, their portfolios supporting and enhancing one another. Their clergy often coordinate and share information.

### The Dead Three (Dark Alliance)

**Members:** Bane, Bhaal, Myrkul
**Alignment:** Evil
**Nature:** Alliance of convenience

These three rose to godhood together by dividing Jergal's portfolios, but their alliance is based on mutual ambition rather than genuine cooperation. They are rivals as much as allies:
- Their cults compete for influence
- They do not share worshipers
- Each seeks supremacy over the others

> "Underground cults to Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul often count Scions of the Three among their most useful agents." - UA 2025 Realms Subclasses

### Magic and Knowledge

**Members:** Mystra, Azuth, Oghma, Deneir
**Nature:** Complementary portfolios

**Mystra and Azuth:**
> "Mystra serves as goddess of magic; Oghma is god of knowledge; and Deneir is god of writing and language. Azuth takes aspects of these general fields and applies them to the specific practices of wizards." - Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

Where Mystra represents the soul, art, and wonder of magic, Azuth represents study, precision, and technical mastery. Their clergy share temples and shrines.

### Nature Deities

**Members:** Silvanus, Mielikki, Eldath, Chauntea
**Nature:** Loose alliance

These nature gods oversee different aspects of the natural world:
- **Silvanus** - Wild nature overall
- **Mielikki** - Forests specifically
- **Eldath** - Peace and still waters
- **Chauntea** - Agriculture and growing things

They rarely conflict, as their portfolios are complementary rather than competitive.

## Ancient Rivalries

### Selûne vs. Shar

**Nature:** Cosmic opposition
**Duration:** Since the beginning of time

The twin goddesses of the moon (Selûne) and darkness (Shar) have warred since creation itself. Their conflict represents the fundamental opposition of:
- Light vs. Darkness
- Hope vs. Despair
- Revelation vs. Secrets
- Memory vs. Forgetting

This is perhaps the oldest and most absolute rivalry in the Faerûnian pantheon. There can be no reconciliation—their very natures are antithetical.

### Mystra vs. Shar

**Nature:** Magical opposition
**Stakes:** Control of magic itself

Shar covets the Weave and seeks to replace it with her Shadow Weave. This rivalry reached its culmination in 1385 DR when:

> "In 1385 DR, the ascended deity Cyric, aided by Shar, murdered Mystra, the goddess of magic, in her domain of Dweomerheart." - Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

Shar's goal was to destroy the Weave entirely, leaving only her Shadow Weave. The resulting Spellplague devastated Faerûn for nearly a century.

### Tymora vs. Beshaba

**Nature:** Sisterly opposition
**Portfolios:** Good fortune vs. Misfortune

These goddesses are aspects of the original goddess Tyche, who was corrupted and split in two. They represent opposite sides of the same coin:
- **Tymora** - Lady Luck, good fortune
- **Beshaba** - Lady Doom, misfortune

Their rivalry is personal and eternal, played out through the fortunes of mortals.

---

## Divine Conspiracies

### The Murder of Mystra (1385 DR)

**Conspirators:** Cyric and Shar

This was the most significant divine conspiracy in recent history. Cyric and Shar:
- Planned and executed the murder of Mystra
- Attacked her in her own domain of Dweomerheart
- Caused the Spellplague
- Ripped asunder the fabric of magic

**Cyric's Punishment:**
> "Wind howls through the blasted landscape of the Supreme Throne. The only standing structure is the Shattered Castle, a crumbling stronghold that was once Cyric's seat of power. It now serves as his prison, and if the other deities have their way, it will do so for centuries more." - Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide

The Supreme Throne is sealed against all comings and goings—total isolation from the cosmos.

### The Theft of the Tablets of Fate

**Conspirators:** Bane and Myrkul

These two of the Dead Three stole the Tablets of Fate from Ao, the overgod. This theft:
- Triggered Ao's judgment
- Caused the Time of Troubles
- Led to all gods being cast down to walk as mortals
- Resulted in the deaths of multiple deities

---

## Hierarchical Relationships

### Ao and the Gods

**Ao** is the overgod who stands above all other deities. He:
- Created the rules by which gods operate
- Punished the entire pantheon for the theft of the Tablets
- Elevated Midnight to become Mystra
- Does not require or want worship

### Exarchs and Servitor Relationships

Some gods serve as exarchs to greater gods:
- **Jergal** serves **Kelemvor** as scribe of the dead
- **Azuth** has a subordinate relationship to **Mystra**
- **Siamorphe** is an exarch of **Amaunator**

### The Seldarine and Lolth

The elven pantheon (Seldarine) is unified against:
- **Lolth** - The Queen of Spiders, who was cast out and became goddess of the drow

This represents the most significant schism within a single racial pantheon.

---

## Portfolio Conflicts

### Competition for Worshipers

Gods with overlapping portfolios compete for the same worshipers:
- **Kelemvor** vs. **Myrkul** - Different approaches to death
- **Cyric** vs. **Bhaal** - Murder domain (Cyric stole it; Bhaal reclaimed it)
- **Oghma** vs. **Deneir** - Knowledge and writing

### Portfolio Theft and Transfer

When gods die, their portfolios can be:
- **Claimed** by the killer
- **Redistributed** by Ao
- **Reclaimed** if the original god returns

**Example:** After the Time of Troubles, Cyric held portfolios of murder, death, strife, and lies. When Bhaal returned in 1482 DR, he "reclaimed the domain of murder from Cyric."

---

## The Role of Mortals

### Mortals as Divine Agents

Gods work through mortal agents:
- **The Chosen** serve specific deities
- **Clergy** spread their god's influence
- **Adventurers** may be unknowing pawns in divine conflicts

### Mortals Becoming Gods

Several mortals have ascended to godhood:
- **Midnight** became **Mystra**
- **Kelemvor** became god of the dead
- **Cyric** became god of lies

This possibility means mortal actions can permanently alter the divine hierarchy.

---

## Divine Neutrality and Non-Interference

### Neutral Gods

Some gods deliberately avoid taking sides:
- **Oghma** - Knowledge for its own sake
- **Gond** - Creation and invention
- **Silvanus** - Wild nature, without moral judgment

### The Harpers and Divine Politics

The Harpers work to maintain balance, sometimes opposing even good-aligned powers who become too dominant. This reflects a mortal attempt to manage divine conflicts.

---

## Regional Divine Politics

### The Moonsea Region

- **Bane** worshiped openly in Mulmaster
- **Cyric** influential in Zhentil Keep
- Good-aligned temples maintain footholds

### Baldur's Gate

- Special significance to the **Dead Three**
- Site of Bhaal's return (1482 DR)
- Competing cults vie for influence

### Cormyr and the Dales

- Traditional worship of good-aligned gods
- **Tymora**, **Chauntea**, **Mystra** prominent
- Strong resistance to evil cults

---

## Consequences of Divine Conflict

### For Mortals

- Wild magic and dead magic zones from the Spellplague
- Chosen and clergy affected by their god's fortunes
- Wars fought in divine names
- Entire nations shaped by divine favor or enmity

### For the World

- The **Time of Troubles** devastated regions
- The **Spellplague** reshaped continents
- The **Second Sundering** continues to cause upheaval

---

## Current State of Divine Relations

### Post-Second Sundering

The current divine landscape includes:
- **Mystra** restored, Weave functioning
- **Cyric** imprisoned but not destroyed
- **The Dead Three** all returned in some form
- **Selûne vs. Shar** continuing eternally

### Uncertain Alliances

Many relationships remain in flux:
- Will Shar attempt to murder Mystra again?
- How long will Cyric remain imprisoned?
- What is the relationship between the returned Dead Three?

---

## Key Principles of Divine Relationships

### Gods Need Worshipers

Without worshipers, gods weaken and can fade entirely. This creates competition and gives mortals leverage.

### Portfolios Define Identity

A god's portfolio is their core identity. Threats to their portfolio are existential threats.

### Death Is Rarely Permanent

> "If the gods can grant the power to raise mortals from death, why do ye assume they should be laid low by it forever?" - Elminster

### The Rules Can Change

The Second Sundering demonstrated that "the rules by which all deities must abide were in flux." Divine relationships may shift in ways unprecedented in cosmic history.

---

## Contradictions & Notes

### Azuth's Independence
Some sources portray Azuth as fully independent; others show him as subordinate to Mystra. The relationship may vary between incarnations of Mystra.

### Cyric's Sanity
Cyric is described as both calculating conspirator and hopelessly insane. His imprisonment may have affected his mental state.

### The Dead Three's Unity
Despite their shared origin, the Dead Three are rivals who may cooperate against common enemies but cannot truly trust one another.
