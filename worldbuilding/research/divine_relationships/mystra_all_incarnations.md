## Overview

Mystra is the goddess of magic itself—or more precisely, she IS magic, in both metaphorical and literal senses. She serves as keeper and tender of the Weave, the conduit through which mortal spellcasters can safely access the raw force of magic. Her portfolio includes magic, spells, the Weave, and the endless possibilities that magic represents.

Throughout the history of Toril, there have been three distinct incarnations of the goddess of magic, each born from the death or sacrifice of her predecessor.

> "In two senses, both the metaphorical and the real, the goddess Mystra is the Weave. She is its keeper and tender, but all three times the goddess of magic has died or been separated from her divinity (twice as Mystra, and once as her predecessor, Mystryl), magic has been twisted or has failed entirely." - Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

## The First Incarnation: Mystryl (Pre-History to -339 DR)

### Origins and Nature

Mystryl was the original goddess of magic in the time of ancient Netheril. Unlike her successors, she presided over a more chaotic, unfettered form of magic—one that allowed spells of virtually unlimited power.

The Netherese arcanists had unprecedented access to magic under Mystryl's reign. They could reach directly into the Weave and pluck out mystical energies without the restrictions that would later govern spellcasting. This freedom enabled the creation of mythallars, the floating cities, and magic of extraordinary power.

> "Arcanists didn't memorize spells, they simply reached into the weave—the source of all magic—and plucked out the mystical energies they sought." - Netheril: Empire of Magic

### The Mythallar and the Weave

In 845 NY (Netheril Year), the arcanist Ioulaum created the mythallar—a magical device that:
- Drew directly from the Weave controlled by Mystryl
- Provided access to raw, unfiltered magic
- Allowed creation of magical items without permanency spells
- Generated the constant magical force that kept mountains hovering in the air

> "This magical device dug deep into the weave of magic (controlled by the goddess Mystryl) and gave access to raw, unfiltered magic." - Netheril: Empire of Magic

### The Priesthood of Mystryl

The clergy of Mystryl took particular interest in prodigies. The young Karsus, who cast his first cantra at age two, was trained by the local priesthood, though he ultimately rejected their attempts to indoctrinate him into the church hierarchy. His belief that he was worthy of a god's stature would prove catastrophic.

### Karsus's Folly and Mystryl's Sacrifice (-339 DR)

In the final days of Netheril, the arcanist Karsus—desperate to save his civilization from the phaerimm—created and cast the only 12th-level spell ever made: *Karsus's avatar*. This spell was designed to temporarily steal the powers of a deity.

Karsus chose Mystryl as his target.

> "His body swelled with the sudden influx of godly power, and his mind filled with unimaginable knowledge. Karsus instantly realized the horrible mistake he had made: He stole the power from the one god he shouldn't have." - Netheril: Empire of Magic

The problem was catastrophic: **One aspect of Mystryl's psyche had to constantly rework the Weave to keep it from unraveling**—especially given Netheril's excessive magical output and the phaerimm's magic-draining spells. When Karsus absorbed her power, the Weave began to collapse.

**Mystryl sacrificed herself to save the Weave before the damage became irreparable.** This broke Karsus's link to her power and caused all magic to briefly cease functioning. Without magic, the floating cities of Netheril fell, killing nearly all their inhabitants.

Karsus's petrified body fell from the sky, his dying eyes witnessing the destruction of everything he had sought to save.

## The Second Incarnation: Mystra I (−339 DR to 1358 DR)

### Rebirth and the New Rules

When Mystryl reincarnated herself—this time as Mystra—she took the form of a beautiful peasant girl learning basic cantra magic but with the capacity for archwizardry.

Her first priority was to recreate the Weave, but with crucial differences:

> "This time, she made magic follow a few more rules, and no spell above 10th level would function." - Netheril: Empire of Magic

This limitation was a direct response to Karsus's Folly—ensuring no mortal could ever again cast a spell powerful enough to steal divine power.

### Teaching Through Dreams

Mystra ensured Karsus's story would never be forgotten:

> "Priests and priestesses of the new goddess of magic were told the story of Karsus in dreams and visions when they prayed for spells. It was Mystra's attempt to make sure that nothing like this ever happened again." - Netheril: Empire of Magic

### The Surviving Cities

By the time Mystra completed the new Weave, she was only able to save three of Netheril's floating cities: Anauria, Asram, and Hlondath. These cities safely landed, and their survivors stumbled away in shock, eventually abandoning them due to fear of the phaerimm, the gods, and the orcs.

### Death During the Time of Troubles (1358 DR)

The first Mystra died during the Time of Troubles (see separate research file). The details of her death and the chaos it caused for magic across Toril are extensively documented in the Time of Troubles research.

---

## The Third Incarnation: Mystra II / Midnight (1358 DR to 1385 DR)

### Ascension

Following the death of the first Mystra during the Time of Troubles, a mortal woman named Midnight ascended to take her place as the goddess of magic. She assumed the name Mystra and continued the work of maintaining the Weave.

### The Spellplague and Death (1385 DR)

> "In 1385 DR, the ascended deity Cyric, aided by Shar, murdered Mystra, the goddess of magic, in her domain of Dweomerheart. This act ripped asunder the fabric of magic in the world, unleashing its raw power in a catastrophe called the Spellplague." - Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

The consequences were devastating:
- Thousands of practitioners of the Art were driven mad or killed
- The face of Faerûn was reshaped by waves and veils of mystic blue fire
- Entire nations were displaced or exchanged with realms from other worlds
- Parts of the earth were torn free to float in the air

The Weave was thought destroyed, and the term lost its significance for nearly a century.

---

## The Fourth Incarnation: Mystra III (1479 DR to Present)

### Return During the Second Sundering

> "Since the end of the most recent Sundering, both Mystra and the Weave have returned to their roles of centuries past, and spells and magic items are more reliable than they had been while the Spellplague raged." - Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

The Second Sundering began with omens of divine upheaval. In 1482 DR, Bhaal was reborn in Baldur's Gate, suggesting that "the rules by which all deities must abide were in flux." By the time the Sundering concluded, Mystra had returned, and the Weave was restored.

Evidence of her return includes the restoration of the Moonbridge mythal in Silverymoon:

> "Mythals can also sometimes heal themselves, as did the mythal of Silverymoon, blossoming out of the Moonbridge following Mystra's most recent return." - Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

## The Weave: The Architecture of Magic

### Nature and Function

The Weave is not magic itself, but the raw material from which magic is woven—comparable to threads before they become a garment.

> "The Weave isn't normally visible or detectable, even through the use of spells. Detect magic doesn't let you perceive the Weave, for instance. The Weave isn't magic, precisely, any more than a collection of threads is a garment; it's the raw material from which the tapestry of magic is woven." - Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

### Mystra's Dual Role

Mystra both IS the Weave and tends to it. She provides:
- The conduit through which mortal spellcasters access magic safely
- Protection from the raw, dangerous force of unfiltered magical energy
- Stability that prevents magical catastrophe

### Alternatives to the Weave

Some supernatural abilities don't use the Weave in the customary way:
- Innate magical abilities of certain creatures
- Monks' supernatural powers
- Psionic abilities

These draw on different sources or interact with the Weave differently than standard spellcasting.

## Worship and Clergy

### The Faith of Mystra

> "The faith of Mystra is pervasive in Faerûn, which is to be expected for a land as touched by magic as it is." - Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

**Alignment:** Neutral Good
**Domains:** Arcana, Knowledge
**Symbol:** Circle of seven stars, nine stars encircling a flowing red mist, or a single star

### Worshipers

- Wizards and sorcerers
- Those who use magic or magical objects in daily life
- Alchemists and sages
- Those who find magic wondrous or encounter magic they fear
- Occasional bards

### Goals of the Faithful

> "The goal of Mystra's faithful is simple: that magic be preserved and promulgated throughout the Realms. It isn't unusual for her followers to keep an eye out for those who demonstrate high potential for using magic and help arrange for such persons to find tutelage with a suitable mentor." - Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

### Temple Clergy

The blue-clad priests of Mystran temples actively work to identify magical talent and connect promising individuals with appropriate teachers.

## Relationship with Azuth

Azuth, the High One and Lord of Spellcraft, serves a complementary role to Mystra:

> "Mystra serves as goddess of magic; Oghma is god of knowledge; and Deneir is god of writing and language. Azuth takes aspects of these general fields and applies them to the specific practices of wizards." - Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

Where Mystra represents the soul, art, and wonder of magic, Azuth represents:
- Long hours of study
- Exacting standards of movement and speech
- Cramped, ink-stained fingers

Temples dedicated to Azuth are scarce, and shrines to him often stand in corners of temples to Mystra.

## Cultural References

### Rashemen and the Hidden One

The witches of Rashemen revere a triumvirate of goddesses called "the Three": Bhalla (the Den Mother), Khelliara (the Forest Maiden), and **the Hidden One**. Scholars have speculated that the Hidden One may be another face of Mystra.

### The Helmlands

After the Time of Troubles, a region of Cormyr became known as the Helmlands—also called **"the Pits of Mystra"**—an area marked by widespread wild magic and dead magic zones where the rules of spellcasting break down.

## Contradictions & Notes

### Incarnation Count
Sources sometimes conflate the incarnations or number them differently. The count used here:
- Mystryl (1st)
- Mystra I (2nd)
- Mystra II/Midnight (3rd)
- Mystra III/Current (4th)

### The Spellplague's Duration
The Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide describes a century-long period of magical chaos following Mystra's death in 1385 DR, while other sources suggest the worst effects were more limited in duration.

### Elminster's Diminished Power
Post-Spellplague sources note that even powerful figures like Elminster experienced diminished powers after Mystra's fall, though he remains active in Shadowdale.
