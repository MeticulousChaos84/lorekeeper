## Overview

The Chosen are mortals who have been blessed, empowered, or selected by deities to serve as their agents in the mortal world. These individuals possess powers and longevity beyond normal mortals, acting as the hands of their patron gods on Toril.

The most famous Chosen are those of Mystra, the goddess of magic, though other deities also have their Chosen servants.

## The Chosen of Mystra

### Nature and Purpose

The Chosen of Mystra are mortals blessed with a portion of her divine power, serving as her agents to:
- Preserve and promulgate magic throughout the Realms
- Instruct creatures in the use of magic
- Leave spell scrolls, workbooks, and magic items to be found
- Act as intermediaries between powerful mages

> "Like the Chosen of Mystra who are so infamous in tavern tales and legends, her Servants travel the Realms instructing creatures in the use of magic, and leaving spell scrolls, workbooks (simple spellbooks), and even magic items to be found. The intent is to leave so much magic in so many places that rulers, law keepers, and selfish wizards cannot control or hoard it all." - Elminster's Forgotten Realms

### Known Chosen of Mystra

#### Elminster Aumar

**Title:** Elminster the Sage, Elminster of Shadowdale
**Status:** Active (though diminished since the Spellplague)

The most famous and perhaps most powerful of Mystra's Chosen. Elminster is an ancient wizard who has served multiple incarnations of the goddess of magic.

**Key Facts:**
- Resides in Shadowdale
- Referred to as "the advisor without peer"
- Old guard wizard (nonspecialized mage)
- Among those whose approval carries weight in matters of timekeeping and Realms-wide standards
- His powers diminished after Mystra's death in the Spellplague, though he remains active

> "Most of the old guard wizards like Khelben and Elminster are nonspecialized mages." - Campaign Setting Box Set

> "Shadowdale remains peaceful and secure, even with the absence of powerful protectors of old, such as Storm Silverhand. Elminster resides there still, but his powers have diminished since Mystra's fall." - Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide

**Cultural Impact:**
- "There may well be an Elminster the Barber or an Elminster of Waterdeep, but a reference to Elminster (or the even more modest Elminster the Sage) refers to the advisor without peer who resides in Shadowdale."
- His name is famous enough that no additional descriptor is needed
- Both Elminster and Khelben are "on probation" at Candlekeep after agents bearing their symbols engaged in a magical duel in the general reading room

#### Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun

**Title:** The Blackstaff, Archmage of Waterdeep
**Status:** Historical figure (deceased or ascended)

One of the most powerful wizards in Faerûn and a key figure in Waterdeep's governance.

**Key Facts:**
- LN hm W27 (Lawful Neutral human male Wizard of 27th level)
- Generally assumed to be one of the Lords of Waterdeep
- Perhaps chief among the Lords, exceeding even Piergeiron in some views
- Old guard wizard (nonspecialized mage)
- Helped implement Present Reckoning dating system

> "It is generally assumed that the archmage Khelben Blackstaff Arunsun (LN hm W27) is also of the Lords, and perhaps chief among them, exceeding even Piergeiron." - Campaign Setting Box Set

**Historical Note:**
In 1312 DR: "Jyordhan slain by Khelben" - indicating a long history of significant actions in Faerûn.

#### The Seven Sisters

The Seven Sisters are daughters of Mystra (the second incarnation), born to different mothers and raised separately, but all sharing their mother's silver fire and divine power.

##### Known Sisters:

**The Simbul**
- Former ruler of Aglarond
- One of the most powerful mages in Faerûn
- Thought to have perished in the Year of Seven Sisters (1425 DR)
- Legend says she was consumed in the fire that destroyed the god Velsharoon
- Actually survived and resides in the Dalelands (according to FRCG)

**Storm Silverhand**
- One of the original Knights of Myth Drannor
- Historical protector of Shadowdale
- Her absence is noted as significant to Shadowdale's changed state

**Dove Falconhand**
- Member of the Knights of Myth Drannor
- Ranger and adventurer
- One of Ed Greenwood's original characters

**Laeral Silverhand**
- Archmage
- Connected to Waterdeep politics

**Qilué Veladorn**
- Drow priestess
- Unique among the Seven for her dark elven heritage

**Other Sisters:**
- Syluné (The Witch of Shadowdale)
- Alustriel Silverhand (ruler of Silverymoon)

### Other Servants of Mystra

Beyond the Chosen, Mystra has various other servants:

**Mystrels** - Early priesthood designation
**Mystwardens / Bearers of Mystery** - Later designation
**Magerobes** - Popular name by 1300s DR
**Servants** - What they call themselves

These clergy wear blue and actively work to:
- Identify those with magical potential
- Arrange for promising individuals to find suitable mentors
- Preserve and spread magical knowledge

## Chosen of Other Deities

### Chosen of Bhaal

The Lord of Murder selects certain mortals to serve his purposes. During the Time of Troubles, Bhaal's essence was scattered among his mortal offspring, the Bhaalspawn.

**Torlin Silvershield**
- Formerly a duke of Baldur's Gate
- Became a Chosen of Bhaal
- Transformed into a wight
- Found in the Tomb of the Nine Gods

### The Scion of the Three

A recent phenomenon where certain individuals draw power from all three of the Dead Three (Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul). These are not traditional Chosen but rather those who have tapped into the malevolent energies of this divine triumvirate.

> "A Scion of the Three draws power from a group of malevolent gods known as the Dead Three: Bane, deity of tyranny; Bhaal, deity of violence and murder; and Myrkul, deity of death." - UA 2025 Realms Subclasses

These individuals are most common in Baldur's Gate, where the Dead Three have long competed for influence.

## Powers of the Chosen

### Silver Fire

The most distinctive ability of Mystra's Chosen is the silver fire—raw magical energy that manifests as silver flames. This power:
- Distinguishes the Chosen from other powerful mages
- Can be used for various magical effects
- Is a direct gift from Mystra herself

### Extended Lifespan

The Chosen of Mystra live for centuries, some for over a thousand years:
- Elminster has been active since before the Time of Troubles
- The Seven Sisters were born in the era of the second Mystra

### Other Abilities

- Direct communion with their patron deity
- Access to unique spells and powers
- Ability to act as conduits for divine magic
- Enhanced magical abilities beyond their normal level

---

## Role in the Realms

### Political Influence

The Chosen often operate behind the scenes:
- Khelben as one of the Lords of Waterdeep
- Alustriel as ruler of Silverymoon
- The Simbul as ruler of Aglarond

### The Harpers

Many Chosen have connections to the Harpers, a secret organization dedicated to:
- Preserving balance in Faerûn
- Opposing tyranny
- Protecting the innocent

The Harpers use coded messages within folk songs developed by spellsingers.

### Magical Intermediaries

> "Rarely, a mutually trusted person who has no magic will be agreed upon as a go-between—a noble, for example, or a monarch, or perhaps even an ordinary person beloved by both mages. Some mages see it as an honor to have a Chosen of Mystra act as their go-between, and others shun this attention because of the notice others might take of what they're up to as a result." - Elminster's Forgotten Realms

---

## The Spellplague and After

### Diminished Powers

When Mystra was murdered by Cyric and Shar in 1385 DR, her Chosen suffered:
- Loss or diminishment of their silver fire
- Reduced magical abilities
- Some may have perished entirely

### Recovery

With Mystra's return during the Second Sundering:
- Some Chosen regained their powers
- The connection to the Weave was restored
- But the century of chaos left lasting changes

## Contradictions & Notes

### Elminster's Status Post-Spellplague
Sources indicate his powers "diminished" but he remains active in Shadowdale. The exact extent of his current abilities is unclear.

### The Simbul's Fate
The FRCG states she was "thought to have perished" but actually survived and lives in the Dalelands. Her current status and power level are uncertain.

### Khelben's Current Status
The Campaign Setting describes him as active, but later sources may indicate his death or transformation. His precise fate requires further research.

### The Seven vs. Fewer
Some sources refer to the Seven Sisters, but not all sisters may still be alive or active in current timeline.
