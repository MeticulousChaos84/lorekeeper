## Overview

The Dead Three are a triumvirate of evil deities—Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul—who rose to godhood together by claiming the portfolios of Jergal, the ancient god of death. They are called the "Dead Three" because all three died during the Time of Troubles (1358 DR), though each has since returned in various forms.

These gods have particular relevance to Baldur's Gate, where their cults have long competed for influence over mortal hearts.

## Origin: The Legend of Jergal's Abdication

### The Bored God

In the time of Netheril, Jergal was worshiped as the god of death, murder, and strife. He ruled an unchallenged kingdom of eternal gloom in the Grey Waste, where all things eventually came to him. But absolute power brought only boredom.

> "As all things died, everything came to him eventually, and over time he built a kingdom unchallenged by any other god. But he grew tired of his duties, for he knew them too well, and without challenge there is nothing—and in nothingness there is only gloom. In such a state, the difference between absolute power and absolute powerlessness is undetectable." - Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

### Three Ambitious Mortals

During this dark era, three powerful mortals arose—Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul—who lusted after Jergal's power. They forged an unholy pact to gain ultimate power or die in the attempt.

> "Over the length and breadth of the world they strode, seeking powerful magic and spells and defying death at every turn. No matter what monster they confronted or what spells they braved, the three mortals emerged unscathed at every turn." - Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

### The Journey to the Castle of Bone

The trio journeyed into the Grey Waste to challenge Jergal:
- Through armies of skeletons
- Through legions of zombies
- Through hordes of wraiths
- Through a gauntlet of liches

They finally reached the Bone Throne.

### The Confrontation

> "'I claim this throne of evil,' Bane the tyrant shouted to Jergal.
> 'I'll destroy you before you can raise a finger,' threatened Bhaal the assassin.
> 'And I shall imprison your essence for eternity,' promised Myrkul the necromancer." - Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

### Jergal's Surprising Response

Rather than fight, the weary god simply gave up his power:

> "Jergal arose from his throne with a weary expression and said, 'The throne is yours. I have grown weary of this empty power. Take it if you wish—I promise to serve and guide whichever of you proves your right to rule.'" - Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

### The Contest

When the three began fighting among themselves over who would rule, Jergal intervened with a suggestion: divide the portfolios through a game of skill. He gave them the skulls of his three most powerful liches for skull bowling.

When Malar the Beastlord arrived and disrupted the game, Jergal suggested they let Lady Luck decide instead. He broke off his skeletal finger bones and they played knucklebones.

### The Division of Portfolios

Through their game of chance, the three divided Jergal's power:
- **Bane** assumed the portfolio of **strife** (and later tyranny)
- **Myrkul** took **rulership of the dead**
- **Bhaal** claimed the portfolio of **murder**

Jergal became a scribe of the dead, later serving Kelemvor in recording the passing of souls.

## The Three Gods

### Bane, God of Tyranny

**Titles:** The Black Hand, the Lord of Darkness
**Alignment:** Lawful Evil
**Domain:** War
**Symbol:** Upright black hand, thumb and fingers together

#### Philosophy

> "Bane has a simple ethos: the strong have not just the right but the duty to rule over the weak. A tyrant who is able to seize power must do so, for not only does the tyrant benefit, but so do those under the tyrant's rule." - Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

Bane represents ambition and control. His worshipers include:
- Those seeking to become conquerors
- Those carving kingdoms from the wilderness
- Those bringing order to the lawless
- Those who want strength to match their drive

#### Complex Legacy

> "At many times and in many places in Faerûn, the faithful of Bane have been seen as saviors for their efforts in slaughtering raiders, throwing down corrupt rulers, or saving armies on the brink of defeat. But in just as many other places, the worship of Bane has created or supported cruel dictatorships, aided mercantile monopolies, or brought about the practice of slavery where before it didn't exist." - Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

#### Current Status

Bane has returned to power and is actively worshiped. Mulmaster in the Moonsea region furthers his worship, and underground cults operate in many cities.

---

### Bhaal, God of Murder

**Titles:** The Lord of Murder
**Alignment:** Neutral Evil
**Domain:** Death
**Symbol:** Skull surrounded by ring of bloody droplets

#### Philosophy

> "Bhaal is the Lord of Murder and a patron of assassins... Murder is natural. Slaying is what all creatures do." - Multiple sources

Bhaal represents unlawful killing—death dealt by choice rather than necessity.

#### Worshipers

> "The folk of Faerûn don't normally pray to or acknowledge Bhaal. He is seen as a deeply evil and destructive deity who hungers for death—meaning the death of any sentient beings through unlawful means." - Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

Those who do pray to Bhaal:
- People seeking to commit murder (sometimes for "good" reasons)
- More often: those motivated by jealousy, greed, or wrath
- Assassins and compulsive killers as patrons

> "Murder cults of Bhaal have arisen in the past, each led by a charismatic, self-styled priest of Bhaal, but organized worship of the Lord of Murder is extremely uncommon." - Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

#### The Bhaalspawn

During the Time of Troubles, knowing he would die, Bhaal scattered his divine essence among his mortal offspring—the Bhaalspawn. These children carried fragments of his power and could potentially be used to resurrect him.

#### Return (1482 DR)

> "In 1482 DR, Bhaal, the long-dead god of murder, was reborn in Baldur's Gate amid chaos and bloodshed, leaving two of the city's dukes and many of its citizens dead. The return of Bhaal and his apparent reclamation of the domain of murder from Cyric led some scholars and sages to believe that the rules by which all deities must abide were in flux." - Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

This rebirth was one of the first signs of the Second Sundering.

---

### Myrkul, God of Death

**Titles:** Lord of Bones, Lord of the Dead
**Alignment:** Neutral Evil
**Domain:** Death
**Symbol:** White human skull

#### Philosophy

Myrkul represents death as an end—not transition, not judgment, but simply cessation. His creed emphasizes:
- Reminding the living of death through garb and symbols
- Carrying skulls and trailing finger bones
- Being feared, for "to harm you is to die"

#### Role

Unlike Kelemvor (who judges the dead fairly) or Jergal (who records their passing), Myrkul ruled the dead as a tyrant lord rules subjects—with absolute power and no mercy.

#### Current Status

Myrkul has returned in some form and is worshiped by necromancers, death cultists, and those who see power in the fear of death. His priests are known to seek political influence and the downfall of the living.

## The Dead Three in Baldur's Gate

### Historical Significance

Baldur's Gate has a particular connection to the Dead Three:
- Multiple cults have operated within the city
- Bhaal was reborn there in 1482 DR
- Underground cults to all three gods compete for influence

> "Scions of the Three are most common in Baldur's Gate, where the Dead Three have long competed for influence over mortal hearts. Underground cults to Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul often count Scions of the Three among their most useful agents." - UA 2025 Realms Subclasses

### The Scion of the Three

A recent phenomenon where rogues draw power from all three gods simultaneously:

> "A Scion of the Three draws power from a group of malevolent gods known as the Dead Three: Bane, deity of tyranny; Bhaal, deity of violence and murder; and Myrkul, deity of death." - UA 2025 Realms Subclasses

These individuals can choose which of the three to align with, gaining:
- **Bane:** Psychic damage resistance, Minor Illusion cantrip
- **Bhaal:** Poison damage resistance, Blade Ward cantrip
- **Myrkul:** Necrotic damage resistance, Chill Touch cantrip

---

## Jergal: The Former Lord

### Current Role

After dividing his power among the Dead Three, Jergal took a lesser role as scribe of the dead:

> "Jergal is now seen as an uncaring custodian of the dead. He is thought to record the passing of the living and to aid Kelemvor in seeing that souls are properly bound to their appropriate afterlife." - Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

### Temples and Worship

Jergal has no dedicated temples aside from abandoned places devoted to his old, darker incarnation. His priests are welcome in temples of Kelemvor, Deneir, and Myrkul.

### Symbol

A skull biting a scroll—representing his role as recorder of the dead.

## Death and Resurrection

### The Time of Troubles

All three of the Dead Three died during the Time of Troubles (1358 DR):
- Their mortal avatar forms were slain
- Their portfolios were claimed by others
- Cyric took many of their domains

### Kelemvor's Rise

Kelemvor, a mortal who traveled with Midnight during the Time of Troubles, eventually ascended to become god of the dead, taking over Myrkul's core domain.

### The Returns

Each of the Dead Three has returned in some form:
- **Bane:** Fully restored to godhood
- **Bhaal:** Reborn in 1482 DR
- **Myrkul:** Status less clear but actively worshiped

The return of Bhaal in particular signaled that "the rules by which all deities must abide were in flux."

---

## Cyric's Role

### Usurper

After the Time of Troubles, Cyric claimed many portfolios that had belonged to the Dead Three, including:
- Murder (from Bhaal)
- Death (partially, from Myrkul)
- Strife (from Bane)
- Lies and illusion

### Current Imprisonment

> "Wind howls through the blasted landscape of the Supreme Throne. The only standing structure is the Shattered Castle, a crumbling stronghold that was once Cyric's seat of power. It now serves as his prison." - Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide

Cyric is sealed in the Supreme Throne with no connections to other planar locations. The other deities intend for this imprisonment to last centuries.

---

## Contradictions & Notes

### Bhaal's Return and Cyric
When Bhaal returned and reclaimed murder from Cyric, it demonstrated that even stolen divine portfolios could be recovered by their original holders.

### The "Dead" in Dead Three
The name persists even though all three have returned, reflecting their deaths during the Time of Troubles.

### Relationship Between the Three
Though they rose to power together, the Dead Three are rivals as much as allies. Their cults compete for influence rather than cooperating.
