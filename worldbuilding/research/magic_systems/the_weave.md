## Overview

The Weave is the most fundamental element of magic in Faerûn—the raw substrate from which all arcane power flows. Understanding the Weave is essential to understanding how magic operates throughout the Realms.

> "The Weave is an essential element of the universe, running through everything in unseen threads."
> — Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, Page 18

The Weave is not magic itself, but rather the raw material from which magic is woven. As the source text elegantly explains:

> "The Weave isn't magic, precisely, any more than a collection of threads is a garment; it's the raw material from which the tapestry of magic is woven."
> — Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, Page 18

## The Nature of the Weave

### Invisibility and Detection

The Weave is not normally visible or detectable, even through magical means:

> "The Weave isn't normally visible or detectable, even through the use of spells. Detect magic doesn't let you perceive the Weave, for instance."
> — Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, Page 18

This is a crucial distinction: *detect magic* reveals the **constructs** made from the Weave (active spells, magic items), but not the Weave itself.

### Innate Connections

Some creatures, objects, and locations have deep, intrinsic ties to the Weave that allow them to perform extraordinary feats naturally:

- A beholder's flight
- A vampire's charming gaze
- A dragon's breath weapon

These abilities come from **innate connections** to the Weave, not from learned manipulation.

## Manipulation of the Weave

### Spellcasting

Creatures with the necessary talent and skill can manipulate the Weave to perform magic by casting spells. This is learned manipulation, as opposed to innate ability.

When a spell is cast, the caster essentially weaves the threads of the Weave into a specific pattern to produce the desired effect.

### The Unseen Art

> "The inborn magical abilities of certain creatures, the acquired supernatural powers of people such as monks, and psionic abilities are similar in that their users don't manipulate the Weave in the customary way that spellcasters do."
> — Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, Page 18

This "Unseen Art" involves abilities that interact with the Weave differently:

- Monks' supernatural abilities
- Psionic powers
- Innate magical abilities

The source notes: "How these abilities are related to the Weave remains a matter of debate; many students of the arcane believe that the use of the so-called Unseen Art is an aspect of magical talent that can't be directly studied or taught."

**Note:** This is a fascinating area of magical theory that warrants further study. The relationship between psionics and the Weave has been debated by scholars for centuries.

## Mystra and the Weave

### The Goddess as Keeper

This is perhaps the most critical concept to understand about the Weave:

> "In two senses, both the metaphorical and the real, the goddess Mystra is the Weave. She is its keeper and tender."
> — Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, Page 18

Mystra does not merely oversee the Weave—she **is** the Weave in a very literal sense.

> "Mystra is the goddess of the essential force that makes all spellcasting possible. She provides and tends the Weave, the conduit through which mortal spellcasters and magical crafters can safely access the raw force of magic."
> — Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, Page 38

### Historical Instability

The intimate connection between Mystra and the Weave has had catastrophic consequences when disrupted:

> "All three times the goddess of magic has died or been separated from her divinity (twice as Mystra, and once as her predecessor, Mystryl), magic has been twisted or has failed entirely."
> — Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, Page 18

The three instances:
1. **Mystryl's death** during Karsus's Folly (-339 DR)
2. **Mystra's first death** during the Time of Troubles (1358 DR)
3. **Mystra's second death** initiating the Spellplague (1385 DR)

### The Spellplague Era

> "With Mystra's last death and the coming of the Spellplague, the Weave was thought destroyed, and the term lost its significance."
> — Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, Page 18

During this period (1385-1487 DR), the Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide notes:

> "Now the term 'Weave' is just another name for magic, if it is used at all."
> — Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, Page 50

The breaking of the Weave had far-reaching consequences:

> "The breaking of the Weave destroyed most of the portals that crisscrossed Toril, because it destroyed the hard-won knowledge of arcane casters."
> — Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, Page 4

### Restoration

> "Since the end of the most recent Sundering, both Mystra and the Weave have returned to their roles of centuries past, and spells and magic items are more reliable than they had been while the Spellplague raged."
> — Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, Page 18

## Magic Items and the Weave

### Creation

> "Where a spell effect is brought to life by manipulating the threads of the Weave, the creation of a magic item ties some of those threads together in a specific way, to produce the desired effect for as long as the item lasts."
> — Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, Page 19

Magic items are essentially **permanent constructs** of Weave threads, as opposed to the temporary constructs of spells.

> "The Weave provides immediately available energy for spells and also enables those who know the craft to harness that energy..."
> — Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, Page 19

### Attunement

> "In some cases, the magic of an item must be tied to its wielder, representing an entwining of the threads of the Weave between wielder and object known as attunement."
> — Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, Page 20

## Weave-Affecting Magic

Several spells interact directly with the Weave's structure:

### Detect Magic

> "Detect magic reveals threads of the Weave woven together through spellcasting, or the 'knots' of the Weave in a magic item. A magic item appears enmeshed in the silvery-blue threads of the Weave, and the way the threads are arranged reveals what type of magic is used (necromancy, abjuration, and so on)."
> — Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, Page 19

**Visual Description:** Active spells and magical areas appear "limned in a silvery network of threads, which might twist and reknit themselves depending on the magic involved."

### Dispel Magic

> "Dispel magic unwinds and prematurely ends magic, unraveling whatever construct of the Weave was put in place."
> — Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, Page 19

### Antimagic

> "Antimagic effects can dispel existing spells and unravel any magic woven from the Weave. Permanent effects, such as those from magic items, are usually suppressed by antimagic: while the effect is within an area of antimagic, the construct of the Weave unravels, but the threads snap back into place once the magic is outside the area."
> — Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, Page 19

## Anomalous Weave Conditions

### Dead Magic Zones

> "In rare areas of dead magic, the Weave is absent. Not only do spells and magic items cease to function, but even the supernatural abilities of creatures that are innately tied to the Weave might fail as the knot of the Weave they carry with them unravels."
> — Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, Page 19

### Wild Magic Zones

> "In an area of wild magic, the Weave becomes 'tangled,' spontaneously forming its own constructs and resulting magic. It also tends to twist the constructs of the Weave created by spellcasting, causing unexpected results."
> — Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, Page 19

The Campaign Setting Box Set Revised notes that:

> "Due to the work of the faith of Mystra most of the wild magic areas in civilized regions have been discovered and either destroyed or at least prominently marked with a warning sigil (nonmagical, of course)."
> — Campaign Setting Box Set Revised

## Mythals

Mythals represent the most powerful manipulation of the Weave:

> "Mythals are some of the most powerful magic in the world of Toril, constructs that bind and shape the Weave in a particular location, sometimes so powerfully that the rules of magic or even reality can be bent or rewritten."
> — Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, Page 20

A mythal is described as "a permanent field of overlapping magical effects." Notable mythals include:

- **Myth Drannor's mythal**
- **Evereska's mythal**
- **Silverymoon's mythal**

### The Fall of Myth Drannor

> "In a struggle for control of Myth Drannor's mythal and the Weave itself, the flying capital of Netheril was brought crashing down on Myth Drannor, resulting in the cataclysmic destruction of both."
> — Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, Page 17

## The Netherese Understanding

The Netherese arcanists of ancient times had a sophisticated understanding of the Weave, though their hubris ultimately proved catastrophic:

> "This magical device [the mythallar] dug deep into the weave of magic (controlled by the goddess Mystryl) and gave access to raw, unfiltered magic."
> — Netheril: Empire of Magic, Page 10

The Netherese ability to tap directly into the Weave enabled them to:
- Create floating cities
- Power quasi-magical items
- Achieve unprecedented magical feats

However, this also made them dependent on the Weave's stability—when Karsus's Folly disrupted the Weave, their entire civilization fell.

## The Shadow Weave

**Note:** A secondary magical substrate exists called the Shadow Weave, which was controlled by Shar rather than Mystra. This represents an alternative path to magical power with different properties and dangers.

> "The Ordulin Maelstrom... Hanging above it on a mobile earthmote is a Shadovar citadel—the site of bizarre and dangerous experiments designed to resurrect the Shadow Weave."
> — Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, Page 177

**Further Research Needed:** The Shadow Weave warrants its own comprehensive study, particularly regarding its relationship to Shar and how it functioned during the Spellplague when the primary Weave was disrupted.

## Sorcerers and the Weave

> "The Weave of magic infuses every part of the Realms, and some people have the natural ability to perceive, touch, and shape the Weave."
> — Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, Page 131

Unlike wizards who learn to manipulate the Weave through study, sorcerers have an innate connection:

- Some inherit it from magical ancestors (dragons, angels)
- Others gain it by accident from exposure to wild magical power
- Some manifest it by chance or divine will

## Key Principles Summary

1. **The Weave is substrate, not magic itself** - It is the raw material from which magic is crafted
2. **Mystra IS the Weave** - Both literally and metaphorically
3. **The Weave is everywhere** - Running through all things in unseen threads
4. **Manipulation requires talent/training** - Either innate ability or learned skill
5. **The Weave can be damaged** - Deaths of the goddess have catastrophic effects
6. **Magic items are permanent constructs** - Threads tied together in stable patterns
7. **Mythals bend the Weave's rules** - The most powerful known manipulations

## Contradictions & Notes

- The Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide (set during the Spellplague) states the Weave was destroyed, while the Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide (post-Sundering) confirms its restoration. These are not contradictions but rather reflect different eras.
- The exact nature of the "Unseen Art" and its relationship to the Weave remains genuinely unclear in the sources—this appears to be intentional ambiguity.

## Further Research Needed

- **Shadow Weave mechanics** - How exactly does it differ from the primary Weave?
- **Weave restoration process** - How did Mystra restore the Weave after the Sundering?
- **Mythallar technology** - Deeper study of Netherese methods of accessing raw magic
- **Psionic-Weave interaction** - The sources are deliberately vague on this relationship
- **Regional Weave variations** - Do different regions have different Weave densities or qualities?
