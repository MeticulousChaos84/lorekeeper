## Overview

Arcane magic in Faerûn is organized into eight distinct schools, each representing a particular approach to manipulating the Weave. While all wizards can learn spells from any school, some choose to specialize, focusing their studies on a single discipline in exchange for greater mastery.

> "Some mages are specialist wizards, concentrating their work in a particular direction and devoting themselves to a particular school of magic. A school differs from a college and university in that it is a particular type of study as opposed to a physical location."
> — Campaign Setting Box Set Revised, Page 179

## Historical Context

### Growth of Specialization

> "Specialist mages have always existed in the Realms, but their numbers (save for the illusionists) were never great previous to the Time of Troubles. Most of the old guard wizards like Khelben and Elminster are nonspecialized mages."
> — Campaign Setting Box Set Revised, Page 179

The Time of Troubles (1358 DR) marked a significant shift:

> "Since the Time of Troubles, the number of specialist wizards has increased, and these wizards have differing attitudes from their elders. The result of this magical gap in ages has yet to be resolved."
> — Campaign Setting Box Set Revised, Page 179

This "magical gap in ages" represents an ongoing tension in the arcane community between traditional generalists and the newer specialists.

## The Eight Schools

### 1. Abjuration

**Focus:** Protective and defensive magic

> "Abjurers: These wizards specialize in abjuration spells, and are practical-minded pessimists (some would say realists) who like to remind others that in a dangerous world, the first order of business is to stay alive and whole."
> — Campaign Setting Box Set Revised, Page 179

**Characteristics:**
- Practical, cautious mindset
- Focus on survival and protection
- Prefer green and brown clothing

**Racial Restrictions:** Only humans can be abjurers

### 2. Conjuration/Summoning

**Focus:** Calling creatures and effects from elsewhere

> "Conjurers are specialists in conjuration/summoning magics, and believe that to be a successful mage, all you need is to be able to call into being allies, lackeys, or powerful servants to work your will."
> — Campaign Setting Box Set Revised, Page 179

**Characteristics:**
- Flashy in dress and attitude
- Confident in their ability to summon help
- Believe in delegating work to conjured beings

**Racial Options:** Humans and half-elves can be conjurers

**Historical Note:** The famous destroyed school of wizardry in Beregost was founded by the mage Ulcaster and was "a school of conjurers and summoners."

### 3. Divination

**Focus:** Information gathering and foresight

> "Diviners: These cautious wizards specialize in the divination school, particularly those spells of higher than 3rd level (known as the greater divinations). They are careful, cautious planners, bookish and literal in their outlook, as they are directed toward the gathering and verification of information."
> — Campaign Setting Box Set Revised, Page 179

**Characteristics:**
- Careful, cautious planners
- Bookish and literal-minded
- Conservative and modest dress
- Focus on information verification

**Racial Options:** Humans, elves, and half-elves can be diviners

**Notable Example:** Halruaan wizards are famous for "the foresight of their divinations," which allowed them to save their nation during the Spellplague.

### 4. Enchantment/Charm

**Focus:** Influencing minds and imbuing objects

> "Enchanters: Enchanter specialist wizards hold a dual role. They imbue their magics into static objects, but also use their enchantment/charm spells to influence and control others."
> — Campaign Setting Box Set Revised, Page 179

**Characteristics:**
- Very self-confident
- Consider themselves superior to other mages
- Social creatures who dress stylishly
- Most comfortable in cities with many potential subjects

**Racial Options:** Humans, elves, and half-elves can be enchanters

**Special Note:** Dark nagas receive a +2 bonus to saving throws against enchantment/charm school magic due to their mental nature.

### 5. Evocation/Invocation

**Focus:** Creating energy and matter from nothing

> "Invokers are those mages who specialize in the invocation and evocation schools of magic. Capable of calling matter and effects such as lightning and fire out of thin air, they are used to possessing power and commanding the respect (or at least fear) of those around them."
> — Campaign Setting Box Set Revised, Page 179

**Characteristics:**
- Self-confident to the point of cockiness
- Accustomed to commanding respect (or fear)
- Prefer bright primary colors in dress
- Direct and powerful approach to magic

**Racial Restrictions:** Only humans can be invokers

### 6. Illusion/Phantasm

**Focus:** Creating false sensory experiences

> "Illusionists are devoted to one of the eldest specialty wizard schools, concentrating on the powers of illusion and phantasm. As a group they tend to be secretive, even to the point of having their own written language, Ruathlek, derived from their magical writings."
> — Campaign Setting Box Set Revised, Page 179

**Characteristics:**
- Among the oldest specialist traditions
- Extremely secretive
- Have their own written language (Ruathlek)
- Dress in simple grays and browns with accent colors
- Gnomish illusionists are more civil and friendly than human ones

**Racial Options:** Only humans and gnomes can be illusionists

**Notable Location:** The isle of Nimbral is home to "Leira-worshiping illusionists" who are "even more secretive and less welcoming of strangers than before their disappearance."

### 7. Necromancy

**Focus:** Magic dealing with life, death, and undeath

> "Necromancers are a two-sided coin. Some are interested in necromancy from its healing and restorative aspect in relation to the human body, while others (the better-known half) concentrate their work on the dead and undead."
> — Campaign Setting Box Set Revised, Page 179

**The Two Camps:**

**White Necromancers:**
- Focus on healing and restoration
- Work with local churches
- Generally good-aligned
- Less well-known to the public

**Black Necromancers:**
- Focus on death and undead
- Secretive to the point of obsession
- Vengeful and often black-hearted
- Dress matching their dark outlook
- The "better-known half"

**Racial Restrictions:** Only humans can be necromancers

### 8. Transmutation/Alteration

**Focus:** Changing the properties of things

> "Transmuters, the masters of the alteration school of magic are, as a rule, creatives, experimenters, and explorers who are never happy with the way things are, but rather intensely intrigued by the way things could yet be."
> — Campaign Setting Box Set Revised, Page 179

**Characteristics:**
- Creative and experimental
- Always exploring possibilities
- Never satisfied with status quo
- Dress for comfort over fashion or camouflage

**Racial Options:** Humans and half-elves may be transmuters

## Magical Education in the Realms

### Traditional Apprenticeship

> "All manner of spellcasters people the Forgotten Realms, and though universities and magical schools exist, the great majority of spellcasters still learn their skills in the time-honored fashion: by apprenticeship to a higher-level mage."
> — Campaign Setting Box Set Revised, Page 179

The apprenticeship system involves:
- Years of "arduous and unpleasant chores"
- One-on-one instruction
- Traditional mentorship model

### Magical Colleges and Schools

> "These schools are almost nonexistent in the North, appearing only in the past 20 winters, and their first students are just now making their name in the Realms at large."
> — Campaign Setting Box Set Revised, Page 179

**Characteristics of Schools:**
- Multiple students (rarely more than a few at once)
- Three or four sages with magical ability
- More common (and larger) in the South

**Notable Schools:**
- Halruaa: "Its masters are wizards who are organized into great schools, its lowest master being on the same par with Khelben, Elminster, or the Simbul in the North."
- Silverymoon: Contains "a music conservatory and a school of thaumaturgy within its gates."

### Destroyed Schools

**Ulcaster's School (Beregost):**
> "On a hill to the east of Beregost lies the burned ruins of a school of wizardry founded some 300 years ago by the mage Ulcaster. It was destroyed 80 years later by Calishite mages who feared the school's collective power had come to rival their own."
> — Campaign Setting Box Set Revised

This was notably a school of conjuration and summoning.

## Dead Magic and School Interactions

> "Spells of the divination school will not function if the target or subject is within a dead magic area. Illusions will not operate within the dead magic area, though they can be seen by characters inside the area if cast outside the area."
> — Campaign Setting Box Set Revised

This demonstrates that different schools interact differently with anomalous magical conditions.

## Netherese "Arcanists"

In ancient Netheril, wizards were called "arcanists" rather than using modern terminology:

> "Two years later, the community considered the first human arcanist (Netheril's name for a wizard) the third-most-important person in their society."
> — Netheril: Empire of Magic, Page 8

The Netherese did not use the same school classifications as modern wizards; their magical study was organized differently, though they practiced all the same types of magic.

## Racial Affinities

The sources show clear patterns in which races can specialize:

| School | Available Races |
|--------|----------------|
| Abjuration | Humans only |
| Conjuration | Humans, Half-elves |
| Divination | Humans, Elves, Half-elves |
| Enchantment | Humans, Elves, Half-elves |
| Evocation | Humans only |
| Illusion | Humans, Gnomes |
| Necromancy | Humans only |
| Transmutation | Humans, Half-elves |

**Note:** These restrictions appear to be specific to 2nd Edition rules and may not apply in later editions. Modern 5th Edition does not impose racial restrictions on arcane traditions.

## The Weave and School Classification

When *detect magic* is cast, the arrangement of Weave threads reveals the school:

> "A magic item appears enmeshed in the silvery-blue threads of the Weave, and the way the threads are arranged reveals what type of magic is used (necromancy, abjuration, and so on)."
> — Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, Page 19

This suggests the schools are not arbitrary classifications but reflect genuinely different ways of weaving magical threads.

## Contradictions & Notes

1. **Edition Differences:** Racial restrictions on specialist wizards were a 2nd Edition mechanic not carried forward into 5th Edition.

2. **Evocation vs. Invocation:** These terms are sometimes used interchangeably in older sources. Modern usage favors "evocation."

3. **School Numbers:** While eight schools is the standard modern classification, this wasn't always the case in earlier editions or in ancient Netheril.

## Further Research Needed

- **Ruathlek:** The secret language of illusionists warrants deeper study
- **Halruaan school organization:** How do their "great schools" differ from northern traditions?
- **Historical evolution of schools:** When and how did the eight-school classification become standard?
- **Red Wizards of Thay:** Their school specialization and organizational structure
- **Bladesinger traditions:** How arcane warriors integrate school knowledge with combat training
