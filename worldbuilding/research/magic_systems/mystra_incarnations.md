## Overview

The goddess of magic has held her portfolio through three distinct incarnations, each leaving an indelible mark on the nature of magic in Faerûn. Understanding these transitions is essential to comprehending the current state of the Weave and arcane practice.

## The Three Incarnations

### 1. Mystryl (Ancient Netheril Era to -339 DR)

The original goddess of magic, Mystryl presided over magic during the height of Netherese civilization. Under her stewardship, magic operated under different rules than it does today—most notably, spells above 10th level were possible.

> "Mystryl's position called for one of the aspects of her psyche to constantly rework the weave of magic—the weave that Netheril and its glut of magic and the phaerimm with their magic drain spells constantly threatened to unravel."
> — Netheril: Empire of Magic, Page 12

**Key Characteristics:**
- No upper limit on spell levels
- Direct oversight of the raw Weave
- Constant maintenance required to prevent magical collapse

**Death:** Mystryl sacrificed herself during Karsus's Folly in -339 DR to prevent the complete unraveling of the Weave. When Karsus stole her divine power, she had to sacrifice herself to break his connection and save magic itself.

> "Mystryl sacrificed herself to save the weave before the damage became irreparable."
> — Netheril: Empire of Magic, Page 12

### 2. First Mystra (-339 DR to 1358 DR)

> "When Mystryl reincarnated herself—this time as Mystra—she used the form of a beautiful peasant girl learning the basics of cantra magic but with the capacities for archwizardry."
> — Netheril: Empire of Magic, Page 12

Upon reincarnation, the new goddess of magic made fundamental changes to prevent another Karsus's Folly:

> "Her first priority was to recreate the weave of magic. This time, she made magic follow a few more rules, and no spell above 10th level would function."
> — Netheril: Empire of Magic, Page 12

**Key Characteristics:**
- Imposed the 10th-level spell cap
- More structured magical rules
- Lawful neutral alignment (maintaining balance in use of magic)

**Death:** The first Mystra was destroyed during the Time of Troubles in 1358 DR.

### 3. Second Mystra / Midnight (1358 DR to 1385 DR)

> "During the Time of Troubles Mystra was destroyed and recreated as a mortal named Midnight who took the mantle of goddesshood and the goddess's portfolio."
> — Campaign Setting Box Set Revised, Page 183

This transition brought a significant shift in the goddess's nature:

> "At this time Mystra's stated alignment shifted from lawful neutral, maintaining the balance in use of magic, to neutral good, reflecting the mortal's attitudes towards the uses and purpose of magic."
> — Campaign Setting Box Set Revised, Page 183

**Key Characteristics:**
- Neutral good alignment
- More focus on beneficial uses of magic
- Retained all trappings of predecessor to maintain continuity

> "Unlike Cyric, Mystra seems to be playing a long-term game, for while she is as new a power as he, she has taken all the trappings of her predecessor to keep the peace with her worshippers."
> — Campaign Setting Box Set Revised, Page 183

**Death:** Murdered by Cyric (with Shar's involvement) in 1385 DR, triggering the Spellplague.

### 4. Third Mystra (1487 DR to Present)

> "Since the end of the most recent Sundering, both Mystra and the Weave have returned to their roles of centuries past."
> — Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, Page 18

The current incarnation emerged during the Sundering. The exact nature and identity of this incarnation is less documented in the sources.

## Symbols and Appearance

The goddess's symbols have evolved with her incarnations:

> "Mystra's symbol was a blue-white star before the coming of the Avatars, and now is a circle of stars in a ring, with a red mist rising towards (or flowing from) the center. Both symbols are still in use."
> — Campaign Setting Box Set Revised, Page 183

**Visual Forms:**
- **Pre-Time of Troubles:** Portrayed only as a prismatic will-o-the-wisp, capable of using any spell known in the Realms
- **Post-Time of Troubles:** Portrayed in human form with radiant skin

## Divine Portfolio and Function

> "Mystra is the goddess of magic, which makes her one of the most powerful deities in the Realms. Known also as the Lady of Mysteries, she is said to have taught the first spellcaster of the Realms, and to have enabled many of the races to use magic."
> — Campaign Setting Box Set Revised, Page 183

**Core Responsibilities:**
- Maintaining the Weave
- Judging new spells and magical items
- Enabling safe access to raw magical power

> "Mystra is the goddess of the essential force that makes all spellcasting possible. She provides and tends the Weave, the conduit through which mortal spellcasters and magical crafters can safely access the raw force of magic."
> — Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, Page 38

> "She is claimed to weigh and judge each new spell or magical item to determine whether it should be permitted into the Realms."
> — Campaign Setting Box Set Revised, Page 183

## The Ethos of Mystra

> "Mystra is the goddess of magic, and with that the goddess of possibilities. She is most venerated by wizards and those who use magic or magical items in their daily use."
> — Campaign Setting Box Set Revised, Page 183

Core principles:
- **Choice and decision**
- **Knowledge**
- **Good for the most individuals**

From Elminster's Forgotten Realms, the creed is described as:

> "Seek to learn and create new magic..."
> — Elminster's Forgotten Realms, Page 158

## The Clergy of Mystra

> "The hierarchy of Mystra includes all forms of spellcasters, including priests, wizards, bards, rangers, and paladins. Only those who gain their spells directly from a higher power gain their spells from the goddess, but all are welcome within the hierarchy."
> — Campaign Setting Box Set Revised, Page 183

**Dress and Practice:**
> "Priests of Mystra tend towards blue garb, sometimes trimmed with white. They are very tolerant of the older symbology and beliefs in Mystra, as they feel that one may only press forward by learning about the past."
> — Campaign Setting Box Set Revised, Page 183

**Historical Titles for Priests:**
- Mystrels (earliest name)
- Mystwardens or Bearers of Mystery
- Magerobes (popular name by 1300s DR)
- Servants (their own preferred name)

> "Like the Chosen of Mystra who are so infamous in tavern tales and legends, her Servants travel the Realms instructing creatures in the use of magic, and leaving spell scrolls, workbooks (simple spellbooks), and even magic items to be found."
> — Elminster's Forgotten Realms, Page 158

## The Chosen of Mystra

The Chosen are mortals granted special powers and status by Mystra herself.

> "Other mortals may have received the boon of Mystra, with the names Elminster and Khelben being mentioned most often."
> — Campaign Setting Box Set Revised, Page 185

**Purpose of the Chosen:**
- Instruct creatures in the use of magic
- Leave magical resources to be found
- Ensure magic remains widespread

> "The intent is to leave so much magic in so many places that rulers, law keepers, and selfish wizards [cannot hoard it]."
> — Elminster's Forgotten Realms, Page 158

**Trading Magic:**
> "Some mages see it as an honor to have a Chosen of Mystra act as their go-between, and others shun this attention because of the notice others might take of what they're up to as a result."
> — Elminster's Forgotten Realms, Page 182

### The Seven Sisters

The most famous group of Chosen are the Seven Sisters, seven powerful spellcasters:

> "Mystra is said to have had a special relationship with Elminster the Sage as well as the Seven Sisters, seven powerful spellcasters. The full nature of this is unrevealed."
> — Campaign Setting Box Set Revised, Page 183

One of the Seven is explicitly mentioned:

> "Dove Falconhand, one of the famous Seven Sisters, was one of them [the Knights of Myth Drannor]."
> — Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, Page 143

**Important Note:**
> "The Seven hold great magical powers, which to date have seemed to foil the best attempts of the Red Wizards, Halruaans, Zhentarim, and other factions to discover their true nature. Their power seems to be closely linked with Mystra, and seems not to have been reduced in the slightest by the Time of Troubles."
> — Campaign Setting Box Set Revised, Page 186

### Elminster of Shadowdale

> "Mystra is said to have had a special relationship with Elminster the Sage..."
> — Campaign Setting Box Set Revised, Page 183

> "It should be noted that any powerful spellcaster, be he the Sage of Shadowdale or Khelben Arunsun of Waterdeep, is touched by the Goddess."
> — Campaign Setting Box Set Revised, Page 183

## Relationship with Azuth

Azuth serves as Mystra's servant, friend, and advisor:

> "Azuth is the god of wizards and mages (and to a much lesser degree, all who cast spells), as opposed to Mystra, who is the goddess of all magic. Azuth is Mystra's servant, friend, and advisor."
> — Campaign Setting Box Set Revised, Page 186

## Temples and Worship

Temples to Mystra are found throughout the Realms:

**Notable Locations:**
- Waterdeep (major temple complex)
- Daerlun ("dedicated to Mystra and Azuth, and have in their service a number of powerful wizards")
- Saerloon
- Harrowdale (temple was rebuilt after being destroyed in the Scardale war)
- Silverymoon
- Shadowdale (shrine rather than full temple)

**Shadowdale Shrine:**
> "Situated on the low rise behind the Temple of Tymora, the shrine to Mystra is a low step pyramid of three wide steps, 20 feet by 20 feet at the base and 10 feet by 10 feet at the top. The topmost step is inscribed only with the symbol of Mystra in silver against the dark stone."
> — Campaign Setting Box Set Revised

This shrine notably allows a view of both Sylune's hut and the topmost level of Elminster's Tower—connecting it visually to two beings with deep ties to Mystra.

## The Trifold Curse of Mystra

A powerful protection on mage sigils:

> "A powerful (level 10+) mage's sigil is protected by the Trifold Curse of Mystra, a curse which afflicts those (magician or not) who willfully copy the sigil of a known mage in order to deceive."
> — Campaign Setting Box Set Revised, Page 178

The curse requires three ability checks against Strength, Intelligence, and Charisma.

## The Chosen of the Gods (General Phenomenon)

During the Sundering era, the gods began manifesting through Chosen more broadly:

> "Throughout this period, tales began to spread of individuals who had been touched by the gods and granted strange powers. Some of these so-called Chosen were at the root of the conflicts that grip the land."
> — Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, Page 17

> "By 1489, many of the wars that began during the Sundering had ground to a close... the deities ceased interfering with the world through their Chosen. The gods were no longer silent but quiet."
> — Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, Page 18

## Relationship with Other Gods

**Oghma:**
> "Much as Mystra of old was said to sit in judgement of each new spell, Oghma is said to decide whether a new idea would be known to the world or confined to its originator."
> — Campaign Setting Box Set Revised, Page 183

> "Oghma is the most powerful god of knowledge in the Realms (second if you consider magical ability as knowledge, with Mystra at its head)."
> — Campaign Setting Box Set Revised, Page 183

**Gond:**
> "To venerate Gond is to continually question and challenge the unknown with new devices and items. This crosses into Mystra's territory (with magical items) and Oghma's (with new knowledge), and Gond is on fairly good terms with both."
> — Campaign Setting Box Set Revised, Page 186

**Shar:**
Mystra's ancient enemy, who controlled the Shadow Weave and was involved in her murder during the Spellplague.

## Wild Magic and Dead Magic Areas

Wild magic areas require special attention from Mystra's faithful:

> "Due to the work of the faith of Mystra most of the wild magic areas in civilized regions have been discovered and either destroyed or at least prominently marked with a warning sigil (nonmagical, of course)."
> — Campaign Setting Box Set Revised

**The Helmlands/Pits of Mystra:**
> "The problematic magic areas have been reduced since the Time of Troubles, but this land has become a fell and evil place. It is called the Helmlands as a reminder that Helm was supposedly responsible for keeping the gods' avatars in Faerûn, letting them wreak havoc. The lands are also called the Pits of Mystra."
> — Campaign Setting Box Set Revised, Page 51

## Contradictions & Notes

1. **Alignment Shift:** The change from lawful neutral to neutral good with the ascension of Midnight is explicitly noted, reflecting how a mortal's perspective altered the goddess's fundamental nature.

2. **Spell Level Caps:** Sources are consistent that Mystryl allowed spells above 10th level while Mystra imposed the cap. However, some later sources suggest 9th level as the maximum—this appears to be edition differences rather than lore contradictions.

3. **Relationship with Chosen:** The "full nature" of Mystra's relationship with the Seven Sisters and Elminster is explicitly noted as "unrevealed" in the sources.

## Further Research Needed

- **The Shadow Weave and Shar's involvement** in Mystra's murder
- **The exact mechanics** of how the Chosen receive their powers
- **The nature of the current (third) Mystra** - far less documented than previous incarnations
- **The fate of the Chosen** after each Mystra's death
- **Sammaster** - mentioned as having "received the wisdom of the gods, but to have had it overpower him, driving him to madness and evil"
- **The Seven Sisters individually** - only Dove Falconhand is explicitly named in the available sources
