## Overview

The Empire of Netheril represented the pinnacle of human magical achievement in Faerûn's history. For over three thousand years, Netherese arcanists pushed the boundaries of magical possibility, developing technologies and techniques that remain unmatched to this day. Their hubris ultimately led to their downfall, but the legacy of Netherese magic continues to influence arcane practice across the Realms.

## Historical Periods

### The First Age (Before 326 NY)

The earliest Netherese learned magic from the elves of Eaerlann:

> "The Netherese learned the use of magic from the Eaerlanni elves and became renowned wizards."
> — Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, Page 16

The first human arcanist was Therion the First of Gers, who cast his first spell (to start a campfire) around year 1 of the Netheril Year calendar.

### The Nether Age (326-864 NY)

This era began with the most important discovery in Netherese history:

> "The year 326 marked one of the most important dates in Netheril's history—the discovery of the nether scrolls."
> — Netheril: Empire of Magic, Page 8

### The Mythallar Era (864-1652 NY)

The creation of the mythallar in 845 NY transformed Netherese civilization:

> "This magical device dug deep into the weave of magic (controlled by the goddess Mystryl) and gave access to raw, unfiltered magic."
> — Netheril: Empire of Magic, Page 10

### The Golden Age (1652-2653 NY)

At the height of their power, Netheril was launching one floating enclave into the sky per year.

### The Shadowed Age (3163-3520 NY)

The final age, marked by Karsus's birth (3163 NY) and the fall of Netheril (3520 NY / -339 DR).

## The Nether Scrolls

### Discovery

> "He called the gold foils the nether scrolls, named after the nation of his birth, and shared his newfound information with the arcanists of Seventon and Zenith a few years later. Within a few short decades, everyone in Netheril was blessed with the knowledge contained in the scrolls."
> — Netheril: Empire of Magic, Page 8

### Nature

> "This set of 100 scrolls provided the Netherese with an incredible jump in spellcraft unseen in the history of Toril. This was an age of tremendous learning in Netheril that lasted until the birth of its greatest archwizards."
> — Netheril: Empire of Magic, Page 8

The scrolls were actually two sets of 50, one older than the other. The furniture found with them suggested a non-human origin—possibly four-legged creatures.

### Theft

> "In the year 764, a tragedy occurred in Netheril: Half of the nether scrolls—one complete set—were stolen. The two copies, luckily, were separated in order to assure that one copy would remain in case of fire or other loss."
> — Netheril: Empire of Magic, Page 10

The stolen set was never recovered.

### Later Fate

> "Centuries later, they [the Netherese] discovered the arcane texts known as the Nether Scrolls in the ruins of Aryvandaar and subsequently abandoned the practices the Eaerlanni had taught them."
> — Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, Page 16

**Note:** This suggests the Nether Scrolls may have originated with the ancient elven empire of Aryvandaar.

## Arcanists

The Netherese term for wizards was "arcanist":

> "Two years later, the community considered the first human arcanist (Netheril's name for a wizard) the third-most-important person in their society, under Nether the Young and Spiritsummoner the shaman."
> — Netheril: Empire of Magic, Page 8

### The Archwizards

> "All of Netheril's archwizards believed the gods were merely archwizards like himself who had found 'ultimate magic.' Their pride wouldn't allow them to put their faith in the deities for fear if they put their trust in these advanced archwizards, they would never achieve 'ultimate magic' themselves."
> — Netheril: Empire of Magic, Page 10

To become an archwizard, one had to:
1. Create a mythallar
2. Carve an enclave from a mountain
3. Erect a city upon it
4. Claim it as one's own

Karsus achieved this at age 22, becoming "the youngest archwizard ever."

### Notable Arcanists

**Ioulaum:**
- Born 544 NY
- Trained over 3,000 arcanists
- Created the mythallar (845 NY)
- Created the first floating city (866 NY)
- Possibly the longest-lived human in history
- Disappeared in 3520 NY

**Karsus:**
- Born 3163 NY
- Became archwizard at age 22
- First spellcasting at age 2 (a cantra)
- Created the only 12th-level spell ever
- Caused the fall of Netheril

**Congenio Ioun:**
- Born 364 NY
- Created the first ioun stones
- Considered the first major arcanist
- Lived 955 years (died 1319 NY)

**The Chronomancer:**
- Born 1652 NY
- Concerned about Netheril's isolationism
- One of the few archwizards who cared about other civilizations

## The Mythallar

### Function

> "This magical device dug deep into the weave of magic (controlled by the goddess Mystryl) and gave access to raw, unfiltered magic. It allowed Netherese arcanists to create magical items without need of a permanency spell and provided the constant magical force that allowed entire mountains to hover in the air."
> — Netheril: Empire of Magic, Page 10

### Previous Magic Item Creation

Before the mythallar, creating permanent magic items was physically devastating:

> "In times before the mythallar, arcanists who made multiple permanent magical items could be picked out of the crowd: Their bodies appeared much older and bent than their years. The process of making an item with permanent effects took its power from the mage's body, a process not many arcanists were willing to succumb to."
> — Netheril: Empire of Magic, Page 10

### Range

Mythallars had a one-mile radius of effect. All quasimagical items had to remain within this range to function.

## Quasimagical Items

### Nature

> "With the advent of the mythallar, arcanists were able to create magical items that would, in effect, be permanent incantations as long as they stayed within the one-mile-radius effect of the mythallar."
> — Netheril: Empire of Magic, Page 10

### Economics

> "Once this magical item was created, the floodgates were opened, and the nation of Netheril was suddenly faced with a glut of magical items. The prices of such quasimagical items dropped to one-tenth the going rate for 'real' magical items."
> — Netheril: Empire of Magic, Page 10

> "The cost of traditional magical creations—those that required a permanency spell—rose to three-times the going rate, since only those who left the range of a mythallar required such items."
> — Netheril: Empire of Magic, Page 10

### Common Items

The democratization of magic led to everyday conveniences:

**Lighting:**
> "The first major quasimagical item designed for the common person was a globe that continually shed light in a room. This ended with it being perfected into a globe that would light with an activating command or sound."

**Water:**
> "Next came running water, contrived by opening a permanent gate to the Elemental Plane of Water, purifying it with quasimagical purifiers."

**Waste Removal:**
> "Waste removal from the home was a logical step."

> "Soon, every house floating on an enclave had one in every room."
> — Netheril: Empire of Magic, Page 10

## Floating Cities (Enclaves)

### Creation

> "Ioulaum took one of his mythallars to the southern section of the Rampant Peaks and sheared off the summit of a mountain with an 11th-level spell. Using a form of Yturn's levitation and Chronomancer's gravity reversal, he placed the mythallar in the center of the flat side (effectively upside down) and rotated the mountain point down, giving him a large, circular, flat surface upon which to build a city."
> — Netheril: Empire of Magic, Page 10

### Purpose

> "Tired of fighting orcs, goblins, and others who wanted to feed off the toils of the Netherese, Ioulaum... called the new structure Ioulaum's Enclave, and it soon became a flying city as people from all across Netheril flocked to him, wanting to live in the clouds, high above the threat of 'those who fear and don't understand magic.'"
> — Netheril: Empire of Magic, Page 10

### Governance

> "As the leader and creator of Ioulaum's Enclave, the archwizard was in absolute control. He allowed the people to have a say—and he sometimes took their advice and wishes to heart—but when it came right down to hard decisions, Ioulaum made them all."
> — Netheril: Empire of Magic, Page 10

As time progressed:
> "As time went on, the people had less and less say, and their voice regarding changes in government, tax rates, and the such were drowned out by the archwizards' lust for more power. The enclaves soon became a vehicle to provide funding for the archwizards' spell research, a staging area for campaigns against other archwizards, and excursions into the quasi- and paraelemental planes."
> — Netheril: Empire of Magic, Page 10

### Numbers

- By 1048 NY: 13 floating cities
- At peak: Dozens of enclaves
- During Golden Age: One new enclave per year

## Spell Levels Above 10th

Under Mystryl's stewardship, spells above 10th level were possible:

> "Using a form of Yturn's levitation and Chronomancer's gravity reversal, he placed the mythallar in the center of the flat side (effectively upside down) and rotated the mountain point down..."
> — Netheril: Empire of Magic, Page 10

This involved an **11th-level spell** to shear off a mountain summit.

### Karsus's Avatar (12th Level)

> "This spell, called Karsus's avatar, was the only 12th-level spell ever created. It was designed to temporarily steal the powers of a deity."
> — Netheril: Empire of Magic, Page 12

After Mystra's restoration, she imposed a cap:
> "This time, she made magic follow a few more rules, and no spell above 10th level would function."
> — Netheril: Empire of Magic, Page 12

## Heavy Magic

Karsus discovered and experimented with a substance called "heavy magic":

> "This graft of physics, chemistry, and magic was so unstable, Karsus felt that it would either be the end of Netheril—and possibly all of Toril—or a boost for the magic that seemed to be draining away."
> — Netheril: Empire of Magic, Page 11

### Properties

- Could be "painted" or "daubed" on surfaces
- Could be enchanted with other spells
- One pound per cubic foot, per caster level
- Extremely unstable

### Uses

> "Karsus found it very handy to force a bit of heavy magic enhanced with a dispel magic into a lock, especially when it disabled the use of detect traps and deactivated a magical lock pick set."
> — Netheril: Empire of Magic, Page 12

He also used it to create illusory environments and to fight demonic incursions.

## Karsus's Folly

### The Spell

> "In 3520, the archwizard Ioulaum disappeared... Karsus, feeling the responsibility for Netheril's future on his shoulders, felt that it was his duty to weld the nation back together."
> — Netheril: Empire of Magic, Page 12

> "When he cast the spell, he chose Mystryl, the goddess of magic."
> — Netheril: Empire of Magic, Page 12

### Immediate Effects

> "His body swelled with the sudden influx of godly power, and his mind filled with unimaginable knowledge. Karsus instantly realized the horrible mistake he had made: He stole the power from the one god he shouldn't have."
> — Netheril: Empire of Magic, Page 12

### Mystryl's Sacrifice

> "Mystryl sacrificed herself to save the weave before the damage became irreparable. This broke Karsus's link to her magic and obstructed the weave, causing all magic to briefly cease functioning."
> — Netheril: Empire of Magic, Page 12

### Consequences

> "Without the infusion of magic, the floating cities of Netheril fell, and Karsus was instantly slain. His bloated body petrified and toppled from the high plateau above his floating city and plummeted to earth."
> — Netheril: Empire of Magic, Page 12

### Survivors

Only three cities survived:
- **Anauria**
- **Asram**
- **Hlondath**

These were high enough above the ground to survive the fall.

### Legacy

> "Karsus was accredited as being the only human to have ever achieved godhood through spellcasting, even if was only for a fleeting moment."
> — Netheril: Empire of Magic, Page 12

A city called Karse was founded near his petrified remains by those who mistook his body for "that of a dying god."

## The Sharn and Phaerimm

### The Phaerimm Threat

The phaerimm were underground creatures that posed an existential threat to Netheril:

> "Karsus discovered that the phaerimm's magic drain was beginning to weaken the life-enduring magic he had constructed around himself."
> — Netheril: Empire of Magic, Page 11

### The Sharn

The sharn were mysterious creatures who opposed the phaerimm:

> "It's unlikely that the sharn's motivations were connected with salvaging the Netherese. The sharn made no effort to contact the Netherese archwizards, preferring instead to act on their own."
> — Netheril: Empire of Magic, Page 12

## Netherese Attitude Toward Religion

> "Like all of Netheril's archwizards, he believed the gods were merely archwizards like himself who had found 'ultimate magic.' Their pride wouldn't allow them to put their faith in the deities."
> — Netheril: Empire of Magic, Page 10

This arrogance was a key factor in their downfall—Karsus believed he could match or exceed divine power.

## The Young Karsus and Mystryl's Priesthood

> "Young Karsus found himself learning spells almost inherently, as though he always knew them. The local priesthood of Mystryl took an immediate interest in the young man and trained him. They tried to indoctrinate him into their church hierarchy, but he wasn't interested."
> — Netheril: Empire of Magic, Page 11

## Modern Remnants

### Shade Enclave

> "The ancient empire of Netheril has been restored. The Twelve Princes of Shade rule from their capital city, Shade Enclave, in a land newly reclaimed from the Anauroch Desert. Netheril is once again a major player and a threat to all the northern realms."
> — Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, Page 4

### Fall of Myth Drannor

> "In a struggle for control of Myth Drannor's mythal and the Weave itself, the flying capital of Netheril was brought crashing down on Myth Drannor, resulting in the cataclysmic destruction of both."
> — Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, Page 17

### The Anauroch

The desert of Anauroch now covers what was once "a verdant land" beneath the floating cities.

## Key Magical Innovations

1. **Mythallars** - Access to raw Weave energy
2. **Quasimagical items** - Cheap, mass-produced magic
3. **Floating cities** - Gravity reversal and levitation
4. **Ioun stones** - Floating magical aids
5. **Heavy magic** - Unstable but versatile magical substance
6. **Spells above 10th level** - No longer possible

## The Fall's Impact on Modern Magic

Mystra's post-Karsus reforms fundamentally changed how magic works:

1. **Spell level cap at 10th** (later editions show this as 9th level)
2. **More rules governing the Weave**
3. **Divine warning about hubris** - Priests of Mystra teach Karsus's story to warn against overreach

> "Priests and priestesses of the new goddess of magic were told the story of Karsus in dreams and visions when they prayed for spells. It was Mystra's attempt to make sure that nothing like this ever happened again."
> — Netheril: Empire of Magic, Page 12

## Contradictions & Notes

1. **Spell Level Caps:** Sources vary on whether the cap is 9th or 10th level. This appears to be an edition difference (AD&D 2E vs. D&D 5E).

2. **Nether Scroll Origins:** The scrolls were found in what became Aryvandaar ruins, but their true origin remains mysterious.

3. **The Sharn:** Their motivations and relationship to the Netherese are deliberately left unclear in the sources.

4. **Modern Mythallars:** Whether this technology survives in Shade Enclave or elsewhere is not detailed in the available sources.

## Further Research Needed

- **Mythallar construction:** How were they actually made?
- **Complete list of archwizards:** Only a few are named in the sources
- **Phaerimm magic drain:** How did it work, and what was their goal?
- **The second set of Nether Scrolls:** Where did they go?
- **Netherese planar exploration:** Expeditions to quasi- and paraelemental planes
- **Heavy magic:** More details on this unique substance
- **Shade Enclave's current state:** Post-Myth Drannor crash status

*These notes compiled in memory of what was lost, and as warning of what ambition unchecked can destroy. May we learn from the Netherese without repeating their fatal arrogance.*
